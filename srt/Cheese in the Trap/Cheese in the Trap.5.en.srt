00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:05,209
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,550
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,449
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,660
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,589
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,929
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,359
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,829
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,840
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,119
I'm serious. You look really old.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,380
Look at yourself in the mirror.
You'll age even more in no time.

12
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,789
Jung.

13
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,359
I heard that there was a thief
in your neighbourhood.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,700
I checked all of your windows
and door just in case.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,540
Okay.

16
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:07,670
Gosh, how sweet.

17
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,709
This is the first time I've seen you
worrying about someone else.

18
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:13,680
It's because she's my girlfriend.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,180
I knew it.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,689
Did you cut off all support for my
sister because of your girlfriend?

21
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,719
Seol. Go in first.

22
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:28,859
Go in now.

23
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,730
Okay.

24
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,810
Is that the reason?

25
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,340
Was it because
I hit on your girlfriend?

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,609
I guess I had forgotten.

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,780
I forgot how you deliberately
mess with people.

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,950
Your sister will need to move out
by the end of this month.

29
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,650
She doesn't even make a penny,
so she can't really afford...

30
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,189
to live in a luxurious
condo like that.

31
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,890
Watch your tongue, you jerk.

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,620
Quit your job at the institute then.

33
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,890
Then I'll reconsider.

34
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,930
Listen. It looks like you're
bothered by the fact that I'm back.

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,129
But what are you going to do?

36
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,770
I have no intention of making you
happy by leaving again.

37
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,539
- Is that so?
- What now?

38
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,080
Are you going to hurt
my right hand this time?

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,479
Is that what you really want?

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,990
Right. This is my favourite moment.

41
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,120
I love it when I see your true self.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,889
I'll see you around often, Jung.

43
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:54,979
(Episode 5)

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Jung, wait.

45
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,599
Jung.

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,050
I told you to avoid him.

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,719
Why did you let him
walk you home?

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,319
Well, it just happened that way.

49
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,259
It was raining, and I didn't bring
an umbrella.

50
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,259
He works at the institute I go to.

51
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,490
Plus, our homes are
in the same direction, so...

52
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,900
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,669
I didn't want you to worry.

54
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,310
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,280
But why are you getting so upset?

56
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,680
Do as I say.

57
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,250
I told you to avoid him,
so avoid him at all costs.

58
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,590
Jung always just says
what he wants to say.

59
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,560
But I've been...

60
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,699
Why?

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,470
I've been very patient with him.

62
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,839
Why do I have to avoid In Ho?

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,040
Why do I have to do as you say?

64
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,980
I at least need to understand
why I need to avoid him.

65
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,420
I told you that he's not my friend.

66
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,019
Are you going to see him
unless I tell you the reason?

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,720
Should I avoid him just because...

68
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,329
he's not your friend?

69
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,180
Let's stop this.
I don't want to argue with you.

70
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,079
- Go in and sleep. Tomorrow...
- When tomorrow comes,

71
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,120
will anything change?

72
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,889
Whether I apologise to you
or ask you a question,

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
you never listen to me anyway.

74
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,160
Without any explanations, you
tell me to avoid him or to stop it.

75
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:25,459
What do you want me to do?

76
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:30,100
What am I to you, Jung?

77
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,910
Is dating supposed to be like this?

78
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,180
I'm going to go in now.

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,129
Hello? Yes, Bo Ra.

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,699
Seol, what should I do?

81
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,100
What's wrong? Did something happen?

82
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:04,370
He was on the floor and
I kept calling him, but...

83
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,910
he didn't answer,
so I called the Rescue Centre...

84
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,170
What did you say?

85
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,079
- Gosh, my dad...
- What was on the floor?

86
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,050
My dad...

87
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,279
Gosh, what should I do?

88
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,750
Bo Ra, I'll come to you now.

89
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,220
Okay. I'll be there soon.

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
- Let's talk.
- Let's talk later.

91
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,100
- Seol.
- Bo Ra's dad is unconscious now.

92
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,269
Okay. I'll give you a ride.

93
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,959
Is he in a critical condition?

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,889
Bo Ra got home...

95
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,399
and found her dad on the floor.

96
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,029
She must be by herself now.

97
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,170
Her mum passed away,
so she doesn't have anyone else.

98
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,870
I'll drive faster.

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Bo Ra!

100
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,160
Where were you? What took you
so long? You, jerk.

101
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,490
Bo Ra, are you okay?

102
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,959
What are you going to do
about my dad?

103
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,100
What are you going to do
if something happens to my dad?

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,399
Bo Ra, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,300
Don't cry. Don't cry.

106
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,339
He will be fine.

107
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,339
How am I going to live
if something happens to my dad?

108
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,879
Don't even say that.

109
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,279
Everything will be fine.
Trust me, Bo Ra.

110
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,410
Bo Ra!

111
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,689
Seol. Seol...

112
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,790
He will be okay. He will be fine.

113
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:04,959
Excuse me.

114
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,430
Is there any empty room available?

115
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,889
She's been crying too much
and needs to rest.

116
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,160
Please come this way.

117
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,459
- Eun Taek.
- We'll stay here, so take her...

118
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,170
and let her lie down. I'll let you
know when we have any news.

119
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
Okay. Bo Ra.

120
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,170
Put me down now. I can walk!

121
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,879
Have a seat.

122
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,480
Let's sit down and wait.

123
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,559
Don't worry too much.

124
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,340
It's because she's my girlfriend.

125
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,350
This is getting interesting.

126
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,049
It'll be a lot of fun.

127
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,970
Do you want to get some sleep?

128
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,679
No. I'll stay up and wait.

129
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,379
Why?

130
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,919
It's not like her dad's condition
will worsen if you sleep.

131
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,320
Well, that's true, but still...

132
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,960
- Is the operation room booked?
- Yes.

133
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,090
Is the anaesthetist on his way?

134
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,529
Yes, he is.

135
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,759
- What's wrong?
- Well, his blood...

136
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,429
We're at a hospital now.

137
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,899
Did it scare you? It's okay.

138
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,309
Are you waiting for the patient,
Mr. Jang Yeong Hoon?

139
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,779
- That's Bo Ra's dad.
- Stay here. I'll go.

140
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,419
Mr. Jang has a cerebral haemorrhage.

141
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,279
Fortunately,
it was detected in the early stage,

142
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,950
so the operation will go
pretty well.

143
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,149
Thank you.

144
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,399
- I'm so relieved.
- You should get some sleep now.

145
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll go and get a blanket.

146
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,399
I'm grateful to have
a shoulder to lean on,

147
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:37,639
but today hasn't been
a good day for us.

148
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,690
Mr. Jang Yeong Hoon's operation
is completed now.

149
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,960
- Please come to the recovery room.
- Sure.

150
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,899
- Are you awake?
- Yes, I heard it. Let's go.

151
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,769
Thank you.

152
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,139
- Bo Ra.
- He's okay now.

153
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,409
The doctor said that
he was very lucky.

154
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,850
I'm so glad to hear this.
Don't worry too much.

155
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,350
Thanks for staying
until this late, guys.

156
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,750
My dad's friends would be here soon,
so you should all go home now.

157
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm going to stay here all night.

158
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,490
- Really?
- How could I leave you alone here?

159
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,230
Seol, you should go home.
Jung, you too.

160
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,529
- I'll get going then.
- Thanks again.

161
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,470
Do you know how many times
I called you?

162
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,169
You were playing the game
again, weren't you?

163
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,970
Let me think. Was I?
I can't really remember...

164
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,970
You're never there for me
when I need you.

165
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,980
I'll never ignore your calls
any more.

166
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,279
- Gosh, let go of my hand now!
- Never.

167
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,679
You stink. Go and wash up.

168
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,019
Don't even come near me.

169
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,159
Do I really stink? What do you
mean I stink? I smell great.

170
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,100
I'm sorry.

171
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,100
I didn't have to get
angry at you like that.

172
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,240
No, it's okay. It's my fault.

173
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,779
Let's sit down and talk.

174
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:29,769
In Ho is...

175
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,740
the grandson of the professor
whom my father looked up to.

176
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,440
After In Ho's grandfather
passed away,

177
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,039
my father started supporting him
financially.

178
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,309
In Ho used to be good at
playing the piano.

179
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,549
But he got into a fight in high
school and got his hand injured.

180
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,519
He still blames me for it.

181
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,100
I told him many times that
it wasn't my fault, but...

182
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,700
we just can't seem to
clear up the misunderstanding.

183
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,509
That's why I told you to avoid him.

184
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,539
Because of the chasm between
me and him, I was worried that...

185
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,279
he might try to harm you
in any way.

186
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,049
Does it make sense to you now?

187
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,690
He says a simple misunderstanding
is what started everything,

188
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,620
but the chasm between them
seems too deep for that.

189
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,700
Fine. I should just trust Jung.

190
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,230
Yes.

191
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,330
By the way, Seol.

192
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,100
You're upset with me, aren't you?

193
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,070
You didn't answer any of
my calls yesterday,

194
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,409
and you seem different
around me for some reason.

195
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,320
Yes. I shouldn't keep
everything boggled up inside.

196
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,389
Actually...

197
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,960
Ju Yeon came to the BA office today.

198
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,690
You remember the hand injury I got
during the midterms, right?

199
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,500
I actually got the injury from
a tussle with a homeless man.

200
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,700
But Ju Yeon said that...

201
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,069
she sent him to where I was.

202
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,109
She also said that
she asked you for help,

203
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,710
but you just left.

204
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,210
Hearing that made me sad.

205
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,420
You chose not to help me
knowing the whole situation.

206
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
So I've been wondering why
you asked me to be your girlfriend.

207
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm the one who called
the security guards.

208
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,299
- Sorry?
- I did say that to Ju Yeon,

209
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,000
but I called the security guards
right away and looked for you.

210
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,539
The next day, I asked you about
the injury because I was worried,

211
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,079
but you said that it was
from opening a can of tuna.

212
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,180
I thought you were hiding it
because...

213
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:01,720
you didn't want a strange rumour
to go around.

214
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,059
But...

215
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,230
Seol.

216
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,400
Did you actually believe
everything Ju Yeon said?

217
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,970
Well... Well, it's just that...

218
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:25,640
This is making me sad.

219
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,289
From now on, I'll talk to you
right away if I ever get...

221
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,559
upset with you so that we don't
have any misunderstandings.

222
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,930
From now on,

223
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,630
I'll never do anything to upset you.
I promise.

224
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,180
I didn't eat anything the whole day.

225
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:04,049
Right, I almost forgot.

226
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,180
I bought these when I went
to get the blanket.

227
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,319
I thought you'd be hungry.

228
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,849
Gosh, really?

229
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,490
I got this gimbap.

230
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,460
I'll open it for you.

231
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,549
Thank you.

232
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,660
Jung doesn't like making
a fuss about things.

233
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,690
Even when he's misunderstood,

234
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,829
he doesn't explain himself
until he's asked.

235
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,700
Yes. This is how Jung is.

236
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,799
Like he said, I should forget
what happened in the past.

237
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,240
I shall forget everything
and start afresh.

238
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,779
That is the right thing to do.

239
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,569
Hi.

240
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,740
Did you get home okay last night?

241
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,339
Goodness. Look who's here.
You're Jung's girlfriend.

242
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,039
You look happy today. Something
good must've happened.

243
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,680
- Yesterday...
- You're so devoted.

244
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,150
You're always early. You're special
enough to be Jung's girlfriend.

245
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,049
Study hard.

246
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,420
What was that about?

247
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
Hey, you.

248
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,369
Are you going home now?

249
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,279
You go first. I'll leave after you.

250
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,680
Your boyfriend can't stand
seeing us together.

251
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,380
Why do we happen to live
in the same neighbourhood?

252
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,019
You know what? Your boyfriend will
hate seeing us like this too.

253
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,150
Go. Go quickly.

254
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,289
Is he not here? I guess
he's not here today.

255
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,019
Look. Why do you keep
trying to provoke me?

256
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,329
What? When did I provoke you?

257
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,329
What's your problem?

258
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,200
If you have something to say,
just say it. Stop provoking me.

259
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:35,529
Something to say?

260
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,970
Sure. I'll say it.

261
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,940
Let's pretend that we don't
know each other.

262
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,039
You must be feeling
uncomfortable too.

263
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,640
How does it sound? Aren't you
grateful that I brought it up first?

264
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,910
Yes! I'm very grateful. Goodness.

265
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,750
I didn't have to talk like that.
Gosh.

266
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,759
You said that they're opening
a restaurant soon, right?

267
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,460
Yes. It's a noodle restaurant.

268
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,259
I was there yesterday,
and the interior looks good too.

269
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,970
The space is big.
You should come check it out.

270
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,130
My mum's noodle dishes
are so delicious.

271
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,599
Well, that's a bit too...

272
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,470
Isn't it a bit too early for me to
meet your parents?

273
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:16,809
Sorry?

274
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,339
Gosh, what was that about?

275
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,480
Was that supposed to be a joke?

276
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,410
Was it not funny?

277
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,150
I wanted to make you laugh.

278
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,789
I see. Well, you did make me laugh.

279
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,460
How about we meet for
dinner tomorrow?

280
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,359
It's on me.

281
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,700
What do you want to eat?
I'll treat you to whatever you want.

282
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,059
I got paid, so I can treat you.

283
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,700
Then I can choose something
very expensive, right?

284
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,140
Like a full-course dinner?

285
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,170
Gosh, that was funny.

286
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,109
That was another joke, right?
Stop joking with me.

287
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:56,880
Okay.

288
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,019
I was joking too.

289
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,049
Okay. Let's eat
what you want to eat.

290
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,920
No, let's go for what you want.

291
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:09,059
Let's just get whatever.

292
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,630
Jung, I was just kidding.

293
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,339
This idiot. How can he study
in a room like this? Goodness.

294
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,680
He could've at least hung this.

295
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,119
Gosh, look at this mess.

296
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,960
Is he busy drinking or studying?

297
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,549
Hi, Sweetie. You're here.

298
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,119
Where have you been?

299
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:14,690
My old friend from middle school
came by,

300
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,559
so I stepped out to see him.

301
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:21,029
Your friend from middle school?
Which one?

302
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:24,700
- You know that guy...
- Who is this friend?

303
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,039
Why do you lie to me
every single day?

304
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,240
My mum said that she was
missing me too much,

305
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,950
so I went to see her briefly
before my dad woke up.

306
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,380
Go back to your mum then.
Go and live happily ever after.

307
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,890
Yoon Seob, don't say that.

308
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,089
You can't leave like this.
Let's talk, okay?

309
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,890
- Eat breakfast before you go.
- No, I don't want breakfast.

310
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,359
- Gosh, you should eat breakfast.
- Leave me alone.

311
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,529
- Excuse me, Sir.
- Hi, Sweetie.

312
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:55,900
Who is he?

313
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,140
He's the landlord's grandson.
What are you doing here?

314
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,079
Yes, good morning.
I was doing my morning exercise...

315
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,380
and thought of the security grilles
on your window...

316
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,349
I repaired for you, so I came by
to check if they're still okay.

317
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,980
- This early?
- Well, yes.

318
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:19,490
By the way, did the two of you
sleep together in that room?

319
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,289
Gosh, it's none of your business.
Why do you ask?

320
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,329
Well, never mind. I understand.

321
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,900
But don't stay over too often.

322
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,140
There's only one tenant
on the lease.

323
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,569
Well, then.

324
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,369
- Gosh, look.
- Well...

325
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:39,980
- You're paying the rent.
- I'm sorry.

326
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,079
- Do you not pay the full rent?
- Gosh, just come in now.

327
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,680
- Who is he?
- He's the landlord's grandson.

328
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,049
Why does he come by at this hour?

329
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,690
Why do you look so serious?

330
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,059
This is the first time
I'm treating you,

331
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,829
so I want to pick
really delicious things.

332
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,630
I see, you're trying to
use a discount coupon.

333
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,799
I know the app.
What's today's coupon for?

334
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,799
Today...

335
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:11,369
- This is the coupon.
- Let's see...

336
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,240
Let's order this.

337
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,980
- Does it look good?
- Yes.

338
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,150
Excuse me.

339
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,029
I want to tell you this because
you might still be worried.

340
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:40,599
I don't talk to In Ho these days,
so please don't worry any more.

341
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,970
If anything ever happens,
tell me right away, okay?

342
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,440
- Okay.
- Right.

343
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,779
How did you become friends
with Bo Ra and Eun Taek?

344
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,720
I met Eun Taek through Bo Ra.

345
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:58,690
I met Bo Ra at a cram school
when we were high school seniors.

346
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,559
At first, I was a bit intimidated by
her because she was so enthusiastic.

347
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,529
Then we became close friends,
and we get along so well now.

348
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,470
In my experience,

349
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:11,700
some people are exactly the same as
the first impressions they give off.

350
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,200
On the other hand, some turn out
to be the exact opposite.

351
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,670
Which case do I belong to?

352
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,279
The relationship between us
was very different last year.

353
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:27,380
What do you think about me
now that you've gotten to know me?

354
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,759
I like you more now.

355
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,589
That's how I feel.

356
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:44,299
I... I feel the same way.

357
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,450
It's getting chilly now.

358
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,319
Well, that scooter
could've hit you.

359
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:08,259
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry. It's okay.

360
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,170
Jung. What is that?

361
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,230
It's a watch.

362
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,240
I guess you like watches.

363
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,769
I had no idea because
you always wear the same one.

364
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,710
That looks good on you.

365
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,920
This... I forgot to take this off.

366
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,019
Look! Seol, this looks
exactly like you. Look at this.

367
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,390
I don't look like that.

368
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:44,430
You look exactly like this.
Look at the red, curly hair.

369
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,500
We should get one each.

370
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,700
I'll pay for that too.

371
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,710
Do I really look like this?

372
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,450
Well, I guess I can see
a little bit of resemblance.

373
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,789
I ended up getting things
from him again.

374
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,430
That watch he was
looking at earlier.

375
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,140
I want to get it for him.

376
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,930
Jung, did you get home safely?

377
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,910
Yes. I'm home. What about you?

378
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,119
Take a guess.
Would I be home now or no?

379
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,089
Gosh, I almost sent it to him.

380
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,240
You're so cute.

381
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,059
I've used up all the money.

382
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,289
I said, I've used up the money.
Are you ignoring my calls?

383
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,700
Your sister here is about to
starve to death, you jerk!

384
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,099
How can you do this to me
as my brother?

385
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:12,380
What kind of people
study as they walk...

386
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,940
or as they drink water? That's
not going to help them at all.

387
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:19,079
This shows how serious Koreans'
obsession with English is.

388
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,819
Study away. You will never
sound like a native speaker anyway.

389
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,359
Aren't we supposed to act
like we don't know each other?

390
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,819
Do I know you?

391
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:30,630
I need to clean the floor,
so please move.

392
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,029
Gosh, wait. Hold on. Wait...

393
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:44,039
Well, I didn't do it on purpose.

394
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,509
Did it get really wet?

395
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,980
Wait, Mad Hair! Are you mad at me?

396
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,019
You don't look cute at all
when you're mad.

397
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,819
What are those two doing now?

398
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:09,500
Pay for these too.

399
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,700
- Do I know you?
- My blood sugar is at rock bottom.

400
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,539
Pay for them quickly, okay?

401
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,849
- Can you really polish my shoes?
- Yes, of course.

402
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:29,450
- Gosh, I can't really believe you.
- Trust me.

403
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,089
Here. Take my shoes then.

404
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,430
Goodness. Shall I give you
this notebook or no?

405
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,400
You should give it to me. I'm
going to polish your shoes for you.

406
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,630
Here. You're allowed to make
only one copy, okay?

407
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,099
- Of course.
- I'll be watching you.

408
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,339
Thank you.

409
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,609
Right, wait. You can't run away
with those shoes. They're expensive.

410
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,009
- Gosh, I won't run away.
- They're expensive shoes!

411
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,309
Okay, please don't worry.

412
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,349
All right.

413
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,690
Goodness.

414
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,029
Hi, Mad Hair.

415
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:18,470
You'll be very surprised to find out
what I'm doing for you now.

416
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,740
You're such a joke.

417
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,509
- Baek In Ha?
- Gosh, my loving brother!

418
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,980
Are you taken aback by
how foulmouthed I am?

419
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,109
Goodness. Where are you now?

420
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,250
Where do you think I am?
I'm in front of this institute.

421
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,490
Bring what I texted you about
and meet me here.

422
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,619
If not, I don't know what I'll do
to your pretty girlfriend here.

423
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,019
Listen. Wait!

424
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,460
Goodness! Darn it.

425
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,029
Thanks for letting me use this.
My brother will be here shortly.

426
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,609
- I'll get going then.
- Wait. I want to talk to you.

427
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,609
How do you know my brother?

428
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,809
He's not the type to get flustered
and worry so much like this.

429
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,819
It's not what you think at all.

430
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,019
In Ho is just an acquaintance
of mine.

431
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,820
He's just an acquaintance.

432
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,690
Yes. We say hi to each other,
and that's all.

433
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,099
- I see. But if that's really all,
- No! Baek In Ha! Baek In Ha!

434
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,099
- why is he running like that?
- You! Baek In Ha! Seriously.

435
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,630
Gosh, that was so loud.
My ears hurt.

436
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,840
- Did she hit you?
- Pardon?

437
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Take this and go in.

438
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,070
Return it to the instructor when
you're done with photocopying.

439
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,809
You better come with me
before I get angrier.

440
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,710
- Ouch. Let go of my hand, you jerk!
- Come with me, you witch.

441
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:36,309
- Come on!
- No, you can't do this to a woman!

442
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,110
- Gosh, jerk. You're so rude.
- Just shut it and come with me.

443
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,219
Let go of my hand. Help me!

444
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,119
- Gosh, I'm so scared! Help!
- Be quiet. You're crazy.

445
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,119
- Goodness, I'm so scared!
- You've lost your mind.

446
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,420
Gosh, let go of this.

447
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,019
- Ouch, my wrist...
- Are you crazy? Are you insane?

448
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,829
Why did you have to bother her? Why?

449
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,099
What a psycho.
Have you really gone crazy?

450
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,630
Can you afford to be dating
right now? You're helpless.

451
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,269
Stop talking nonsense.
I'm not dating anyone.

452
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,369
I'm not interested. Just give me
the money. I need it now.

453
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:03,639
What did you do this time?

454
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,809
I have to pay off my overdue
phone bills. I didn't do anything.

455
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:10,210
By the way, the account
is under your name.

456
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,380
Gosh, seriously.

457
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:20,889
What now? Are you going to hit me?

458
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,630
Go ahead and hit me then.

459
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,630
You're just like Aunt, you jerk.

460
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,630
- You...
- Hit me.

461
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,199
Go ahead and hit me.
You're crazy, Aunt!

462
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,639
- Ouch! You're crazy.
- You, little mouse.

463
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,840
- No, let me go.
- You, witch!

464
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,510
- Why am I raising you? Why?
- Come.

465
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,510
Stop right there! Stop!

466
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,010
Open the door!

467
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,079
In Ha, what's wrong with you?

468
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,619
Why do you keep provoking
Aunt and make her hit you?

469
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,050
A woman like her can't be our aunt.

470
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,090
Let's report her to the police.

471
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,489
That crazy woman should be arrested.

472
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,389
Where are we going to live then?

473
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:59,059
Our parents are dead,
and Grandpa passed away too.

474
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,599
Don't you know that
we'll be homeless?

475
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,469
I don't care.
I can't live here any more!

476
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,239
- Are you going to open this, or...
- What are you doing now?

477
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,239
shall I go and bring the key now?

478
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,309
Open the door now.

479
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,679
If Aunt found out that
we stole this,

480
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:18,610
she'd probably try to kill us.
You'll have to run away with me now.

481
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,219
You, idiot! You'll get caught
if you go through that door.

482
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,019
You're so dumb. Come with me.

483
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,099
Be careful when you're coming down.

484
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,500
- Stop right there! You, thief.
- In Ho!

485
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,500
- Take me with you! In Ho!
- Come down now.

486
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,039
Don't leave me here! In Ho...

487
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,710
- Come down now!
- No.

488
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,110
- You, little mouse. Come here.
- Ouch.

489
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,139
In Ho! Stop right there!

490
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,320
- Hi, In Ho.
- Gosh, how dare you bite me!

491
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,320
- What's wrong?
- Take me with you.

492
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,260
- Where do you think you're going?
- Wait for me. Don't leave me here.

493
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,260
In Ho... Mr. Yu!

494
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,030
Please take me with you.

495
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,829
- When my grandpa passed away,
- In Ha.

496
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,230
- you said you'd help us.
- Come here!

497
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,500
How dare you bite my hand!

498
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,699
Here. Look at all this.
That woman did it.

499
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,239
- What are you doing now?
- Go away! Mr. Yu!

500
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,239
- Please take me with you.
- Who are you?

501
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:20,380
That woman is pure evil!

502
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,619
He gives me money
when I act a little pitiable.

503
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,989
You're so pathetic.

504
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,630
You're still drenched in guilt.

505
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,519
I returned the notebook to
the instructor.

506
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,260
Thank you.

507
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,230
Don't mention it.

508
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,380
Life isn't so bad.

509
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,519
- Thank you. See you again.
- Thank you.

510
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,190
- We hope to see you again.
- Thank you.

511
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,889
- Mr. Hong.
- Yes.

512
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,690
The apron looks great on you.

513
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,429
This is ready.
It's for the table at the end.

514
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,199
- Table number one?
- Yes, that's right.

515
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,630
- Take this yogurt.
- Thank you.

516
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,630
- Thank you for the great food!
- See you soon!

517
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,469
What did he mean
by that apron comment?

518
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,639
- This rice cake is complimentary.
- Thank you.

519
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,380
We hope you enjoy it
and visit us often.

520
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,179
Where are you going?

521
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,920
Goodness. It's so busy right now.

522
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,579
Don't worry. He will be back soon.

523
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,250
What's wrong with your dad?

524
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,719
Why is he so embarrassed by
working here?

525
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,489
Gosh, Yeong Hee. You know
how stubborn and bullheaded he is.

526
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,760
He just needs some time.
Hand me a rice cake.

527
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,699
I wish he was more like you.

528
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Right, Seol. Call Joon
when you have a moment.

529
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,210
He's been pestering me about
coming back to Seoul.

530
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,909
Gosh, he should really be
focusing on studying.

531
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,380
That's what I'm saying.

532
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,690
- Hello?
- Were you sleeping?

533
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,989
I worked at the restaurant all
weekend, so I must've been tired.

534
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,059
You sound really tired.

535
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,460
Let's watch the movie
another time then.

536
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:56,269
I'll come to your neighbourhood.

537
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,429
Really?

538
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,570
There's a place called
Alley Cart Bar in front of my place.

539
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,170
Alley Cart Bar?

540
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,809
Yes. I'll meet you there.

541
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,829
- The number you have dialled...
- Gosh, Ju Yong...

542
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,000
I'd like another bottle
of soju, please.

543
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,699
Goodness. You literally drink
every single day.

544
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,099
How are you going to pass your exam?
Stop drinking and go home now.

545
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,239
Don't say that.
I know I'll pass this time.

546
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:38,070
I'll pass for sure if I can
have another bottle of this.

547
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,280
Yu Jung?

548
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,320
Yes, it's me. Ju Yong.

549
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,219
- Ju Yong.
- I haven't seen you for ages.

550
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,619
Come and have a drink with me. Yes?

551
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,760
Let's have a drink. Come on.

552
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,989
Gosh. How long has it been?

553
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,429
I rarely saw you after
you got into university.

554
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,400
I'm so happy to see you.

555
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,369
- What happened to you though?
- Sorry? Me?

556
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,480
My parents didn't approve of my
girlfriend, so they kicked me out.

557
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,179
You left home
because of your girlfriend?

558
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:21,949
That's right. What can I do?

559
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,289
She's the only one who loves me
unconditionally.

560
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:29,019
Ju Yong. Come to your senses
and move back home.

561
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,630
Listen. Do you even
know what love is?

562
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,400
You always just hung out
with pretty girls.

563
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:37,530
Well, no girl in her right mind
would want to be with you...

564
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,699
Well, I didn't mean to say...

565
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,369
Jung, don't get me wrong.
What I meant to say is that...

566
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,070
I'm not saying that
it was your fault.

567
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,610
Gosh, I must be drunk.

568
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,409
Don't take what I said to
your heart. Just forget it.

569
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,219
- You won't get mad at me, right?
- You're really drunk now. Let's go.

570
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,849
Gosh, no. Not yet.

571
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,389
I haven't seen you in ages.
Buy me drinks.

572
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,860
Let's order one more bottle.
Just one more, okay? I promise.

573
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,699
Hi, Sweetie. What brings you here?

574
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,269
He lives in the room next to mine.
He calls everyone...

575
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,099
like that. By the way, why are
the two of you sitting together?

576
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:18,110
What's going on?
Do you guys know each other?

577
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,610
Are you two dating?

578
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,760
There are so many weirdos
in this world.

579
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,800
What does he need that brick for?
Why is he taking it out of...

580
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,070
That's near the building
Mad Hair lives in.

581
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,269
Who cares? I don't care.

582
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,519
This jerk is unbelievable.

583
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,019
Why is he not answering his phone?

584
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,659
Goodness. Why did he
stay in there for so long?

585
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,489
He doesn't even live here.

586
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,059
Gosh, you're so annoying.

587
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,099
You're getting what you deserve
for annoying me.

588
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,710
Gosh, what am I doing now?
I'm sure everything will be fine.

589
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,980
What's that?

590
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,920
Excuse me. Excuse me.

591
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,550
Wake up. Excuse me!

592
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,989
Call the police. Call now.
Stop screaming already.

593
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,829
- Yes.
- What happened?

594
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,429
- It's the alley by the church.
- Look at all this blood...

595
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,599
- We found a man on the street.
- Tell them to hurry!

596
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:55,840
Yes. Please hurry.
That's right. Please hurry, okay?

597
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,010
It's that scum!

598
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,610
She abandoned me.

599
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,719
In other words, she dumped me.

600
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,219
- Come together.
- Ju Yong, I'll take you home.

601
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,789
His door is...

602
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:27,469
Why did he...

603
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,710
leave his door unlocked?
Hold on a second.

604
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,980
- Hold him.
- Be careful. Be careful. Goodness!

605
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,630
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

606
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:01,369
You can give his key
back to him tomorrow...

607
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:07,079
What am I supposed to do
at a moment like this?

608
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,610
Should I invite him in?

609
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,510
For coffee? Or instant noodles?

610
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:16,119
No, that's weird. That's so weird.
Let me think.

611
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,460
I want to as well,
but let's save it for next time.

612
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,989
Have a good sleep.

613
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,460
Don't forget to lock your door.

614
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,820
A little while ago,
I was taking a shower...

615
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,590
and saw him peeking in
through the window.

616
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,219
- I've never even met you before!
- You're a pervert!

617
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,630
I'm not a pervert!

618
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:59,230
- Why did you peek in then?
- Okay. Please calm down.

619
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:03,469
Please tell us what you were doing
between 9pm to midnight yesterday.

620
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,900
Sweetie! Thank goodness you're here.

621
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,639
I was having drinks with her.
We were drinking, right?

622
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,309
Yes. That's correct.

623
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,539
Is that right?
But this isn't everything.

624
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,679
We received reports about thieves
stealing underwear and other things.

625
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,010
We will need to search your place.

626
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,210
Please come in. Feel free to
look through everything.

627
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,019
You're not busy now, right?
Come with me, please.

628
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:23,920
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- A pervert like you...

629
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,619
needs to get locked up.

630
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,090
Shut it. I wouldn't want your
underwear even if you give it to me.

631
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,230
Gosh, this is making me want to
move. You won't find anything.

632
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:35,030
- Okay. We'll be quick.
- Isn't that woman totally crazy?

633
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,630
Why is she accusing me
of stealing her...

634
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,900
Gosh, I'm just so frustrated.

635
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:41,699
This...

636
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,909
What are all these?

637
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,179
Goodness. Look at all these.

638
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,010
- Well...
- What are all these?

639
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,780
They're not mine!
I didn't steal them.

640
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,719
That's right.
He wouldn't do such a...

641
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,820
Why? What's wrong?
Do you see yours too?

642
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,820
Well, I'm not sure if it's mine.

643
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:04,659
What are you talking about now?

644
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,699
I really didn't steal these.
Someone put them here.

645
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,099
All right. We have evidence now,
so let's talk at the police station.

646
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,969
- Goodness! Come on.
- Listen. Gosh...

647
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,269
All right. What's your name?

648
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,239
Gong Ju Yong.

649
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,880
Hi, Jung. I was going to
call you anyway.

650
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:23,250
I'm at the police station now.

651
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,909
The police station?
Why are you there?

652
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,619
I'm preparing for the bar exam.

653
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,619
I told you about the thief who
steals women's underwear, right?

654
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:34,389
The police found women's underwear
at Ju Yong's place.

655
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,230
At Ju Yong's place?

656
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:40,199
He's saying that he didn't do it.
What should I do?

657
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,030
There's nothing you can do
if evidence was found at his place.

658
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,599
He would be released soon
if he didn't do it. Don't worry.

659
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:48,369
Didn't they say that
they used to be close friends?

660
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,570
Did you say that the victim
is my friend, Yoon Seob?

661
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,380
Wait, where are you going? Stop!
Come back here!

662
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,050
You'll get in bigger trouble
if you run away like that!

663
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,449
What happened?

664
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,059
What is going on, seriously?

665
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,469
My next door neighbour
and Mr. Heo too.

666
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:21,340
- What?
- What is she doing here?

667
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:26,280
Goodness. I called the police,
and they thought I robbed him.

668
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:30,449
Helping other people doesn't
do you any good, okay?

669
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,789
But the person you helped is
one of...

670
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,190
the teaching assistants in my
department. You did the right thing.

671
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,519
So how is he? Is he okay?

672
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,090
Yes, I heard that he's okay.

673
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,800
But why was Mr. Heo there?
I don't get it.

674
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,599
By the way, why were you
in front of my place?

675
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:54,769
What?

676
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:00,010
Listen.
I didn't go there intentionally.

677
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,610
I was chasing that jerk with
the brick and ended up at your...

678
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,949
Why would I need to
go to your place?

679
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,050
You're being ridiculous.

680
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,019
Well, why are you
getting so flustered?

681
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:13,590
- Did I accuse you of anything?
- No.

682
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,289
You didn't.

683
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,900
Thank you, anyway.

684
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,369
Then take me out for a meal.

685
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:27,000
Right. I'm sorry about
what my sister did to you.

686
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:28,670
If you ever run into
my sister again,

687
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,039
just run. I'll see you around.

688
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,219
- I know you hid them here.
- Women's underwear?

689
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,690
- Are you kidding me right now?
- How can I trust you?

690
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,289
- Is Ju Yong back?
- Why would I steal them?

691
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,030
- Then who did it?
- You're not even studying.

692
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,690
You've been ignoring all my calls.

693
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:55,429
And this is what you're
going through?

694
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,300
Gosh, calm down first. Getting
angry won't help your recovery.

695
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:00,139
That's not what's
important right now!

696
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,210
- Where are you going?
- Let go of this!

697
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,980
Seol.

698
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,880
Ju Yong, I thought I'd check in
to make sure that you're okay.

699
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,619
Why are you here?

700
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,550
I live next door.

701
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:20,719
Goodness, I can't
believe these people.

702
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:25,389
Listen. Are you two having fun
toying around with me?

703
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,030
You must be thrilled
to go to school for free.

704
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,269
He gave you his scholarship and hooked you
up with the job at the BA office.

705
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,170
Life must be beautiful for you.
Aren't I right?

706
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Pardon me?

707
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,909
Do you really not know?
Yu Jung, that jerk, threatened me...

708
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,840
and made me throw out his paper
to give you that scholarship!

709
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:47,219
What are you talking about now?
So are you saying...

710
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,789
that rich jerk who's been
threatening you is Jung?

711
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,090
Are you really unaware?

712
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,420
Answer me!

713
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,429
You didn't know?

714
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,739
Yes, Seol. I'm actually
on my way there.

715
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,079
Okay. I'll meet you there then.

716
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,719
Seol.

717
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,960
What's wrong?

718
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,400
Why did you hang up
on me like that?

719
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,469
Did something happen?

720
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,099
Jung.

721
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:44,409
Mr. Heo...

722
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,639
told me that you made him...

723
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,150
throw out your paper last year.

724
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,480
He said that you did it so that
I could get the scholarship.

725
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:56,420
Is that true?

726
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,550
Yes.

727
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,360
Why did you do it?

728
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,590
I didn't want you to take time off
from school.

729
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,900
But back then,

730
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,929
we weren't even
talking to each other.

731
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,639
I wanted to get close to you.

732
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,980
As you said, we weren't even
talking to each other back then.

733
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,710
We also had misunderstandings
about each other.

734
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,010
And I heard that you were
taking time off.

735
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,719
I wanted to help you,
but I didn't know how.

736
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,559
So I gave you my scholarship.

737
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,000
You wanted to get close to me?

738
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:49,170
You wanted to clear up
all the misunderstandings?

739
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,840
Because of this, people criticised
Mr. Heo the whole semester...

740
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,409
by calling him a disorganised TA
who misplaced your paper.

741
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,150
And I became a student who got
the scholarship in an unfair manner.

742
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,550
I was having a great time with you
in front of Mr. Heo and...

743
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,789
blamed him for hating me
because I had no idea.

744
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,159
I don't think Mr. Heo is
the victim in this situation.

745
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,599
He made a mistake to me,

746
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,800
so we decided to call it even
after that.

747
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:18,170
We agreed on it,
and it's all over now.

748
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,369
Did you say that it's all over?

749
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,809
Yes, it's all over.

750
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,739
Seol.

751
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,239
Let's not fight about
what happened in the past.

752
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:34,579
How can everything be
so simple and clear to you?

753
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,650
I told you everything.

754
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,619
You know that students still
badmouth Mr. Heo.

755
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,590
He hates me and...

756
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,130
Have you ever put yourself
in Mr. Heo's shoes?

757
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:53,300
I apologise if I wasn't thoughtful
enough. But I hope you know.

758
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,969
I did it because I wanted to
help you.

759
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,010
I hope you understand
where I was coming from.

760
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,750
I'm sorry. I'm going to go now.

761
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,579
My pride is crushed, and...

762
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:13,389
I can't breathe knowing that someone
got in trouble because of me.

763
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:18,260
I can't thank you for what you did.

764
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,530
I didn't want to get used to
receiving things from people.

765
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:27,170
I wasn't even aware that I was
always getting things from Jung.

766
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:29,199
What infuriates me more is...

767
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,139
watching myself being convinced
by what he said...

768
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,139
and by what he did for me.

769
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:38,809
She told me to be honest with her,

770
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,050
so that's what I did.

771
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,070
Mr. Heo. Where are you now?

772
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:08,039
(Six months ago,
at the end of semester party)

773
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,050
Why do you never have
any money on you?

774
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,159
What are you talking about?
You have no idea.

775
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,039
Please throw out my paper.

776
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,510
Why should I throw out
your paper?

777
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,409
Please discard it
before it gets marked.

778
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:45,909
But if you get zero on it... Are you
going to give up the scholarship?

779
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:47,579
Yes.

780
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,550
Okay. Let's say that I'll throw out
your paper for you.

781
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,219
After that,
what will I tell the professor?

782
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,389
Do you want me to take
the full blame for misplacing it?

783
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:58,030
Do you think I'll agree to this?

784
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,130
I think you will.

785
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,829
Why are you doing this
to me, seriously?

786
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:06,099
I think you owe me this much.

787
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,400
Let's call it even after this.

788
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:13,440
Gosh, Jung is a very scary person.

789
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,710
If you cause harm to him in any way,
he'll give it all back to you.

790
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:18,949
I know. So what should I do?

791
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,349
I won't forgive him if he spreads
a rumour about it.

792
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,750
I'll go find him and
teach him a lesson by...

793
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,949
How shameless can you be?

794
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:27,489
Jung.

795
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,599
Aren't you the one
who is in the wrong?

796
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,170
You can't do this after
we decided to call it even.

797
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,230
So now,

798
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,500
what shall I do?

799
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,369
Gosh, Jung. Calm down. Let's talk.

800
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,340
He just came back from the hospital.
He got his head injured.

801
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,150
What?

802
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,309
Say it! What do you want?

803
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,949
- Stop it.
- Let go of me. What now?

804
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,349
- Gosh, stop it now.
- What do you want?

805
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,420
- Calm down, seriously.
- What are you going to do?

806
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,420
- Go and tell everyone!
- Yoon Seob sounds...

807
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,690
annoying at times, but
he's a really nice guy.

808
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,789
Why are you saying that to him?
I'll just get fired!

809
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,030
What are you two doing now?

810
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:11,300
You two are ridiculous.

811
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,239
One steals credit cards, and
the other one steals underwear.

812
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,440
Do your parents know
that you're living like this?

813
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:22,940
Yoon Seob made that mistake
because of me.

814
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:26,710
But those underwear.
I really didn't steal them.

815
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,980
Let's see what the police says.

816
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:34,159
Gosh, right. This is the kind of
person you are.

817
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:36,719
You have no capacity to
empathise with others.

818
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:38,630
You ruin lives of those
whom you dislike.

819
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,599
Listen. It looks like you've
gotten crueller than before.

820
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,099
Are you saying that this is my fault?

821
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,000
That jerk ruined everything.

822
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,639
He ruined your life
and my current situation too!

823
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,639
- How dare you tell Seol...
- Gosh, Jung. Jung. Jung!

824
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,650
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
I apologise.

825
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,150
I'll get down on my knees like this
and beg you, okay?

826
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,750
Forgive Yoon Seob.
Forgive him this one time.

827
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,519
I feel so bad for him.

828
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:07,019
I owe him a lot. He gave up
many things because of me.

829
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,590
Forgive him this once, okay?

830
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,630
- That's enough. Get up now.
- I'm okay. I said, I'm okay!

831
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:14,159
- Get up.
- Jung. Forgive him, please!

832
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,030
Gosh, stop it now.

833
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,829
Okay. I'll let it slide this once.

834
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,440
Instead, I want you to move back
to your parents' place.

835
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,210
I don't want the two of you
to hover around Seol like this.

836
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:30,510
- Jung, but I'm...
- Shall I tell your parents...

837
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,579
about your current situation?

838
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,320
Ju Yong.

839
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,559
Come to your senses.

840
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:53,130
Ju Yong. Are you going to
move back home?

841
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:57,210
Yes? I'm asking you if you're
going to move back home.

842
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,480
Today has been such a long day.

843
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:06,349
- Right, Sweetie?
- Answer me!

844
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,420
Are you going to move back
to your parents' place?

845
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,030
Let's not fight today.

846
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,739
You haven't changed one bit.

847
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,750
You have no capacity to
empathise with others.

848
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,750
You ruin lives of those
whom you dislike.

849
00:59:39,849 --> 00:59:43,179
How can everything be
so simple and clear to you?

850
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,630
Jung. I made a mistake.

851
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:01,199
I was so desperate.
Do you understand?

852
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:05,340
You've gotten so arrogant because
everyone praises you all the time.

853
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:07,710
I had no idea that things
would turn out this way.

854
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:10,309
Can you please let it go
this once, Jung?

855
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,710
You, jerk.

856
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,320
Who are you to look down
on everyone? Answer me!

857
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:21,289
I'm not the weird one.
All of you are weird.

858
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,030
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- No, I'll pour you a drink.

859
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,389
No, let me do it... Goodness!

860
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,599
You were like that too.

861
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,699
You figured me out
and laughed at me.

862
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,710
You came to your own
conclusions about me...

863
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,650
and avoided me.

864
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,619
Seol.

865
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,789
I'm not a weirdo.

866
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,750
Why are you here
sitting like a mooch?

867
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:21,650
Did you two fight? You should be
kissing and hugging instead.

868
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,750
Just break up.
You're not a good match.

869
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,949
- Shut your mouth.
- Which one is your boyfriend?

870
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:26,219
The punk? The nerd?

871
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:30,760
One sulks all the time, and
the other one wants me to buy...

872
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,829
- You, jerk! Come to your senses!
- Ouch! It hurts. Ouch!

873
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,760
How did you find me?
Your boss sent you here, right?

874
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:37,329
You should leave here now.

875
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:40,969
Hong Seol! I heard that you've
gotten close to Jung.

876
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:42,699
There's no way that he'd be
serious about you!

877
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,610
Why do you think he sent me to you?

878
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,340
People like him are
perfect targets for Jung.

879
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,610
Jung can manipulate them
so easily. Got it?

880
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,550
Shall I stay here tonight?

881
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,250
What did you like about me?

882
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,849
I thought you hated me.

883
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,349
- It's a secret.
- I guess we can't see any more?

884
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,420
So you won't come here any more?
