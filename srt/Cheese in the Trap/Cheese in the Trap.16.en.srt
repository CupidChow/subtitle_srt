00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,540
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,250
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,880
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,019
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,230
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,530
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,870
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,429
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,280
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,770
Seol.

11
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,869
Seol!

12
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,040
You can't come in here.

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,019
At that moment,

14
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,560
why did I hold Jung's hand?

15
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,670
I knew that he's strange.

16
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,299
I was scared, too.

17
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,890
Yes.

18
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,060
Maybe...

19
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,489
I pretended that
it wasn't the case,

20
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,659
but I was bothered.

21
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,299
Behind that sweet smile of his,

22
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,699
he hides his cold,

23
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,139
lonely...

24
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,539
and childish side.

25
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,289
His true colours were very
different from the front he put up.

26
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:33,159
Only I could see them.

27
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,889
He only showed it to me.

28
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,030
I wanted to see...

29
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,199
his true colours.

30
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,039
(Final Episode)

31
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:53,979
Jung.

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,080
How badly is she hurt?
It's not serious, is it?

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,979
A broken rib ruptured her organs.

34
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,419
- Oh no...
- Mum.

35
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,620
Will she be okay?

36
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,129
You said it was a car accident.
How did it happen?

37
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:11,759
Honey. Will Seol be okay?

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,669
What should we do?

39
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,629
Are you Hong Seol's family?

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,069
Yes.

41
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,569
She had a brain hemorrhage,

42
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,409
and a broken right rib damaged...
her lungs and liver.

43
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,780
The surgery went well.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,680
We moved her to the ICU.

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,680
She should wake up in a few hours.

47
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,449
Her temporal lobe
sustained some damage,

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,460
but it's not serious, so we'll see
if she responds to medication.

49
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,430
- Oh dear, Seol...
- Mum.

50
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,530
She'll be okay. The surgery
went well, didn't it?

51
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,919
- What now?
- Are you Baek In Ho?

52
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,629
Who are you? Why do you have
my sister's phone?

53
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,329
I'm a friend of her's.
She got into some trouble.

54
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,240
She called me because
she couldn't reach you.

55
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,569
You should come over.

56
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:28,670
What kind of trouble?

57
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,439
What happened?

58
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,779
Are you really not going
to say anything?

59
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,050
Keeping quiet won't do you any good.

60
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,449
In Ha.

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,250
What happened? Why are you here?

62
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,889
- Are you her brother?
- Yes.

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,959
Did you call me?

64
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,230
What happened?

65
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,660
Are you okay?

66
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,569
She's fine. But the person
she harmed is in a coma.

67
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,769
What?

68
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,500
What does he mean?

69
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,310
I only know what she told me
when she called.

70
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,009
She got into a fight, and
the other person got hit by a car.

71
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,649
What? Why are you here?

72
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,750
Do you know what you've done?

73
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,689
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop that.

74
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,790
Come over here.

75
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,490
Let go of her. You're scaring her.

76
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,259
It was an accident.
I didn't do anything wrong.

77
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,370
It's your fault.

78
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,699
It wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't gone so far.

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,899
It's all your fault!

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,170
You trash.

81
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,470
- Come here.
- Stop it.

82
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,870
I said stop it.

83
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,980
If something happens to Seol,

84
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:41,879
I will make you pay.

85
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,180
I'll kill you!

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,689
What?

87
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,689
What do you mean?

88
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Hey.

89
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,670
Wait a moment.

90
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,569
Is she really in a coma?

91
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,480
You should've left when
I had told you to.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,180
- Which hospital is it?
- You don't deserve to see her!

93
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,079
In Ho.

94
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,449
Hey.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,620
My parents are over there.
Come.

96
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,620
I apologise.

97
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,889
Why did she hate Seol so much?

98
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,889
Why did she do it?

99
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,660
I'm really,

100
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,069
really sorry.

101
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,399
There must be a reason.

102
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,769
Seol doesn't just go around
and get into fights.

103
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,680
How did this happen?

104
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,579
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,180
I will take full responsibility.

106
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,189
How exactly will you do that?

107
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,990
She can't even wake up.

108
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Ms. Kim.

109
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,670
You should go.

110
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,559
Hello?

111
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,759
What?

112
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,429
I'll come right over.
Keep her there.

113
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,769
What happened? Where's In Ha?

114
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,610
I couldn't stop them.

115
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,450
They had papers saying that
they were her legal guardians.

116
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,679
What... Who took her?

117
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,879
Do you know Choi Myeong Hoon,
Taerang Group's Chief Secretary?

118
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,259
It's In Ho. Where is In Ha?

119
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,870
She is with me.

120
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,429
Why is she with you?

121
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,639
We will protect her
until everything is settled.

122
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,070
You'll what? Protect her?

123
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,039
Where are you?

124
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,679
- Let me go.
- Come with us.

125
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,480
- No!
- You'll be fine.

126
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,779
Just a moment!

127
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,179
What's going on?

128
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,379
- Don't worry.
- Don't do this, Mr. Choi.

129
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,850
- Why am I here? Don't do this.
- Get her inside.

130
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,690
Mr. Choi...

131
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:48,259
Why am I here?

132
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,360
Mr. Choi! What am I doing here?

133
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:55,070
I did as you said, Sir.

134
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,169
Good.

135
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,169
You can tell him.

136
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,169
Nothing will change
even if he visits her there.

137
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,340
Cancel my plans for tomorrow.

138
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Bye.

139
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,190
In Ha.

140
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,990
Is Baek In Ha here? Where is she?

141
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,860
You can't see her tonight.
Come back tomorrow.

142
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,870
You brought her here
without my permission.

143
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,529
- I'm her brother!
- Be quiet.

144
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,340
Bring her out right now.

145
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,870
Where is she?

146
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,379
Calm down before
I have you thrown out.

147
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,169
Are you okay?

148
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,070
How could he do this to me?

149
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,039
I was so sweet to him.

150
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,679
He shoved me in here
instead of helping me.

151
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:16,779
Hang on.

152
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,049
Did Mr. Yu put you in here?

153
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,190
Was it not Jung?

154
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,159
I cleaned up after Jung for years.

155
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,029
He asked me to help his son,
and now he locked me up here.

156
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,500
In Ha, did you tell him
everything?

157
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,669
It wasn't just me.
You were just as bad.

158
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,779
When Mr. Yu asked us questions
about Jung, we both tattled.

159
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,379
I'm not the only traitor here, am I?

160
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,980
Why should I be locked up
and treated like a lunatic?

161
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,289
Jung should be here.

162
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,090
In Ho.

163
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,990
I'm going mad in here.

164
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,159
Go to Mr. Yu and do something,
Beg him and get me out.

165
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,970
I can't stand it in here. I hate it.

166
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,840
This place is driving me crazy!

167
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,370
I'm leaving.

168
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,970
Let's go.

169
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,039
- You can't leave.
- Get lost!

170
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,480
- Calm down.
- Take a deep breath.

171
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,080
- Talk to them for me!
- Try to relax.

172
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,450
Don't take me inside!
I don't want to go back!

173
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,389
- Calm down.
- Get me out of here!

174
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,129
Mr. Choi. Where is Mr. Yu now?

175
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,230
Please tell him that
I'm on my way to see him.

176
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,570
Mr. Yu is busy.

177
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,740
You won't be able to see him
for a while.

178
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,610
I must meet him now.

179
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,240
Do you want me to
raid his house right now?

180
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,240
You acting this way
will make things worse for In Ha.

181
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,210
Please think carefully
before you do anything.

182
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,679
I'll hang up now.

183
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,830
Thank you for...

184
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,470
visiting like this.

185
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,100
Please don't mention it.

186
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,139
I should be here, of course.

187
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,669
You must be very worried.

188
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,370
Don't worry too much.

189
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,580
The operation went well,
so she will wake up soon.

190
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,879
And a few of my acquaintances
work at this hospital,

191
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,080
so I asked them to assign the best
doctors and pay special attention.

192
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,220
Please don't worry too much.

193
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,889
Gosh, thank you so much.

194
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,220
It's not a problem at all.

195
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,190
I've also arranged a private room
for your daughter and your family.

196
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,330
Your daughter will be brought there
upon waking up.

197
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,100
You should make yourself
at home there.

198
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,870
And please don't worry about
the bills for her treatments.

199
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,340
I will take care of
the entire expense.

200
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,269
But why would you pay for
my daughter's hospital bill?

201
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,039
She's my son's friend,
so she's no stranger to me.

202
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,779
Please let me help you.

203
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,220
How did you find out?

204
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
In Ha called me
from the police station.

205
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,259
I sent In Ha to Doctor Han.

206
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,860
Isn't Doctor Han...

207
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,559
at the place where Doctor Baek
used to work at?

208
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,440
Then are you saying that you sent
In Ha to a psychiatric ward?

209
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
Look at what In Ha has done.

210
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,639
Could she have done it
if she was in her right mind?

211
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,840
Doctor Han says that...

212
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,049
she could have delusional disorder
or impulse control disorder.

213
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,879
With that, she will be able to
avoid prosecution...

214
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,090
due to her mental condition.

215
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,519
So you're turning In Ha
into an insane person now.

216
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,659
All for helping her evade
from her responsibilities?

217
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:48,929
I cannot approve of that.

218
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,500
This isn't about whether
you can approve it or not.

219
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,399
Let's say that this goes to trial.

220
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:57,000
Can you guarantee that In Ha will
say nothing about you and Taerang?

221
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,039
If she mentions anything,
words will spread.

222
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:03,539
That could put both you and me
in a very difficult position.

223
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,009
How can you not be concerned
about Seol at all?

224
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,539
The accident was unfortunate.

225
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,649
But she's alive, so it's all good.

226
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,149
I'm glad nothing else happened as
it would've been a bigger headache.

227
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,559
Even if Seol wakes up,

228
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,389
she might not be able to
live like before.

229
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,399
She might have to live
with a disability.

230
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,230
Then we'll just compensate her.

231
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,730
I'm paying for her
entire hospital bill.

232
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,740
If it is necessary, I can pay them
a settlement and more compensation.

233
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,440
Then her parents won't
turn it into a problem.

234
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,740
You should persuade her...

235
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,340
so that she and In Ha
will settle the matter.

236
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,659
Do I have to come to a place
like this to clean up your mess?

237
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:54,759
Why do things like this always
have to happen around you?

238
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,000
You shouldn't start what you're
incapable of taking care of.

239
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,500
After the incident
with In Ho's hand,

240
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,830
things were quiet for a few years,
but this had to happen, of course.

241
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,539
It's your fault for dating a girl
like her to begin with.

242
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,139
She didn't have to go through this
if she didn't date you.

243
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,549
You should've listened to me
and ended it then.

244
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,940
As I got to know Jung,

245
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,250
the scary and unfamiliar feelings
went away.

246
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,860
He made my heart flutter...

247
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,160
and also broke my heart at times.

248
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,170
That's why I didn't want to
leave him alone.

249
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,279
I didn't know at the beginning.

250
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,250
Jung!

251
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,920
I didn't know that
I'd fall for someone.

252
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,329
How exciting and scary it can be...

253
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,529
at the same time.

254
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,740
I just...

255
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,069
wanted to...

256
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,079
be with you forever.

257
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,579
I thought that...

258
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,349
everything would be fine
as long as you're with me.

259
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,259
I couldn't understand...

260
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:12,400
why people always
looked at me like that...

261
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,029
or resented me.

262
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,569
But I think I know the reason now.

263
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,710
Don't ever show up before me again.

264
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,609
You're disgusting.

265
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,849
You might make me vomit.

266
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:34,750
You two are quite a pair.

267
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,190
One stole a credit card, and
the other stole underwear.

268
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,460
Do your parents know
about any of this?

269
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,059
No matter how hard you try
to copy her,

270
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:46,730
you can't become her.

271
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,630
Aren't you already aware of that?

272
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,740
Know your place.

273
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,470
How dare you cause a scene here?

274
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,539
I'll give you that money
on the condition...

275
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,210
that you'll stay away from Seol.

276
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,190
I trampled all over...

277
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,019
their hearts...

278
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,359
and emotions.

279
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,630
It must have hurt them so much.

280
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,869
She's alive, so it's all good.

281
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:29,140
I'm glad nothing else happened as
it would've been a bigger headache.

282
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,339
Even if Seol wakes up,

283
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,009
she might not be able to
live like before.

284
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,309
She might have to live
with a disability.

285
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:39,049
Then we'll just compensate her.

286
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,319
I'm paying for the entire
hospital bill.

287
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,289
If it's necessary, I can pay them
a settlement and more compensation.

288
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:47,019
Then her parents won't
turn it into a problem.

289
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,660
Why couldn't I realise it sooner?

290
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,069
I only realised it after
this happened to you.

291
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,480
Don't say anything.

292
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,980
I know what happened,

293
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,220
and I also know why it happened.

294
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,390
I think I also know...

295
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,990
how you must be feeling now.

296
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,359
If you stay with me,
you might get hurt...

297
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,230
and scarred again.

298
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,140
Don't worry.

299
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,839
I will never run away.

300
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,349
Will you be okay though?

301
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,309
Do I really...

302
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,750
not have to...

303
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,650
let go of this hand?

304
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Seol.

305
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,869
Mum... Mum.

306
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,369
Seol. Are you awake now?

307
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,339
Are you okay?

308
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,240
Can you recognise me?

309
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,740
Seol, Jung is outside.
I'll tell him to come in.

310
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,779
You did well.

311
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,220
You're such a strong girl.

312
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,089
What?

313
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,559
What's going on?

314
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,130
Where did he go?

315
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:20,980
You aren't helping yourself at all.

316
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,319
You need to take your medicine
if you want to get out.

317
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,289
Your brother's still here.

318
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,990
He's been here for days.
Don't you want to see him?

319
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,380
- Did she eat?
- She threw it on the floor.

320
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,220
It would help if she had an IV drip,
but she refused that, too.

321
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,349
Even if we stick one in,
she pulls it out.

322
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,650
She throws terrible tantrums,
so we're at a loss.

323
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,019
What will happen next?

324
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,160
If she keeps that up,
we'll have to restrain her.

325
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,000
Anything to help her survive.

326
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,670
Could you...

327
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,170
do me a favour?

328
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,839
It's for a short while.

329
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Okay.

330
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,480
Thank you.

331
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,500
It's me.

332
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,230
You moron.

333
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,400
Don't just mope and whine.

334
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
You want to get out of here.

335
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,880
But acting like that will only
make them think that you're crazy.

336
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,259
You aren't...

337
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,559
alone.

338
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,599
Don't give up like...

339
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,940
you have nothing to live for.

340
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,579
I need you.

341
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,250
So eat your food.

342
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,789
I'll wait right outside.

343
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,980
In Ho, would you like some coffee?

344
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,250
Is she still not allowed visitors?

345
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,190
Eun Taek called. Seol woke up.

346
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,230
That's great.

347
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,769
Shouldn't you see her?

348
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,309
How could I?

349
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,750
- Seol, it's us.
- Hello.

350
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,750
Hi.

351
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,960
- Why are you alone?
- Yes, why are you?

352
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,529
My parents went to open the store.

353
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,700
Joon and Ah Young are here.

354
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,200
How are you feeling?

355
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,029
Strawberries.

356
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,599
- Hello.
- Hi.

357
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,839
Have some.

358
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,240
Has Jung not called you yet?

359
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,950
- No.
- Or come by since you woke up?

360
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,980
That's so weird. He was here
right until you woke up.

361
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,890
Why did he just disappear
without checking on you?

362
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,359
Maybe he's sorting things out.

363
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,160
He could still call, though.

364
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,730
Right? My parents are
really upset about that.

365
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,769
Maybe he feels guilty.

366
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,299
He grew up with the person
who did this to Seol.

367
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,539
Stop talking about him.

368
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:47,880
What? Jae Woo?

369
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,480
Why are you here?

370
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,079
I'm here to see Seol.
I got all worried.

371
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,150
Could you leave so we can talk?

372
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,140
I can't believe Jae Woo's here.

373
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,170
- Were they close?
- No.

374
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:18,440
Why did he want us gone?

375
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,539
How do you feel?

376
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,809
Better.

377
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,619
I know you're the victim here,

378
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,920
and I shouldn't say this,

379
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,349
but In Ha's not doing well.

380
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:34,990
She isn't eating and
won't even see her brother.

381
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,430
I'm really worried
she might actually lose her mind.

382
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,069
In Ho says Jung's father
had her sent there,

383
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,000
but I can't reach Jung.

384
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,369
Do you think...

385
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,809
you could talk to Jung
on her behalf?

386
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,450
I'm sorry for saying this
when you must be feeling terrible.

387
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,819
I'll come by again. Take care.

388
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,319
Bye.

389
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,049
You haven't come to work for days.
Will you at least pick up?

390
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,559
Don't ever take it off.

391
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,359
Or lose it.

392
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,250
I heard...

393
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,849
she was getting discharged.

394
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,859
I know I can't apologise enough.

395
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,069
But I truly am sorry.

396
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,799
You went through a lot.

397
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,529
How are you?

398
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,400
Are you feeling better?

399
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,569
Yes.

400
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Sorry I didn't visit.

401
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,180
My dad told me...

402
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,250
that you came by.

403
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,559
Your sister...

404
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,589
Things happened.

405
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,630
I'm really,

406
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,430
really sorry.

407
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,319
(Agreement to Settle)

408
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,660
It's not because I forgive her.

409
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm just tired...

410
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,400
and exhausted.

411
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,130
I want to put an end to this...

412
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,069
and return to my ordinary life
as soon as possible.

413
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,279
I wish there was
a better way to put it.

414
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,150
I'm so sorry, and...

415
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,289
very grateful.

416
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,559
The piano competition is
just around the corner, isn't it?

417
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,029
Make sure you compete in it.

418
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,569
I won't be able to
keep my promise...

419
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,369
about going to see it though.

420
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:29,950
Did you say that you wanted to quit?

421
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,259
What do you mean by that?

422
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:34,160
I already submitted
my resignation letter to Mr. Kim.

423
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,759
Jung.

424
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,130
- Are you doing this because...
- You were right.

425
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,069
When I was young,
I really hated the fact that...

426
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:46,670
you thought I was weird.

427
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,470
So I tried my best
to restrain and hide it.

428
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,880
I tried so hard not to reveal it.

429
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,650
I...

430
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,250
really wanted you to like me.

431
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,960
Because no one would be
able to understand me anyway,

432
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,660
I probably thought that
I didn't need to understand others.

433
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,769
I let my victim mentality...

434
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,039
make me judge, categorise...

435
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,869
and hurt people.

436
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,750
I had no idea how big and painful...

437
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,019
those wounds could be.

438
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,920
Jung.

439
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,220
I kept denying and telling
myself that I wasn't weird.

440
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,259
But frankly, I'm not sure any more.

441
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,200
So I...

442
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,769
need some time now.

443
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,200
I want to know...

444
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,309
what kind of person I really am.

445
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,549
I didn't want you to take after me.

446
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,150
That was my biggest fear.

447
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,360
But...

448
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,460
You and I...

449
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,929
We resemble each other so much,
don't we?

450
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,780
In Ha. You have a visitor.

451
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,289
It's not your brother.
It's someone else.

452
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,460
Who is it?

453
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:33,739
I won't forgive you.

454
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,309
I can't do that.

455
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,909
From now on,

456
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,920
let's stay out of
each other's lives.

457
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,789
I don't want to.

458
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:55,789
You, In Ho and I.
The three of us used to be happy.

459
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,460
Have you forgotten it all?

460
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,030
- I still keep thinking...
- Forget my family,

461
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,000
my father...

462
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:05,539
and me as well.

463
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,570
Set yourself free, In Ha.

464
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,710
Let's not let our past
stop us any more.

465
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:40,639
Is In Ha really going to be
discharged?

466
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:43,869
There are some paperworks involved,
but we'll take care of them.

467
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,039
We already started the procedure,
so she'll be discharged tomorrow.

468
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,380
Thank you.

469
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:58,320
She'll have to go through
a trial for formality.

470
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,329
No matter what the punishment is,
let In Ha deal with it on her own.

471
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,559
Okay.

472
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,599
I also think that will be
better for her.

473
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,199
Thanks, anyway.

474
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:16,570
And...

475
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,880
I'm sorry about everything.

476
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,849
You owe Seol an apology.

477
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,849
I didn't know.

478
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,719
I had no idea that In Ha and I...

479
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:35,389
have been hurting your feelings.

480
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:41,460
I know that it's too late now,

481
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,139
but I'm sorry.

482
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,190
I found this when I was
organising my belongings.

483
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,460
I wish I could've
given it to you back then.

484
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,639
That pianist whom
you talk about all the time?

485
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,210
I'm going to get his autograph here
and guard it as a treasure.

486
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,250
You're a real fan. What's your name?

487
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,150
I'm Baek In Ho.

488
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,559
Who is it?

489
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,769
- Joon.
- Hi, Jung.

490
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,070
Where is Seol?

491
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,139
She's inside.

492
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,079
Mum! Dad!

493
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,280
Seol.

494
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,909
Jung is here.

495
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,550
I'm sorry...

496
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,960
I haven't been in touch.

497
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:15,989
Here...

498
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:17,630
Did we ask you to bring that?

499
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,260
You should've visited her
a long time ago.

500
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,030
Yes.

501
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,030
We were all sad.

502
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,000
You should've visited
no matter how busy you've been.

503
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,469
I'm really sorry.

504
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,750
You're here, Jung.

505
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,750
Could I take her outside briefly?

506
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,559
Don't stay out too long.

507
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,730
We won't.

508
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,860
I'll take it.

509
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,869
Give me a minute.

510
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:04,369
I'm sorry for not being in touch.

511
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,179
How are you feeling?

512
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,920
I'm getting better each day.

513
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,460
- Seol.
- I...

514
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,260
heard about everything...

515
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,730
that has happened.

516
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,639
I heard about what you did
to In Ha...

517
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,239
and why In Ha...

518
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,010
attacked me.

519
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,280
To be honest,

520
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,019
I blamed you a bit.

521
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:53,659
But I thought while we were apart.

522
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,599
It was just an accident.

523
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,710
So let's go back...

524
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,909
to how things were.

525
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,280
How long...

526
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,019
will you...

527
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,019
be able to manage?

528
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
What?

529
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,130
You can't carry
the entire burden alone.

530
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:38,730
Let's...

531
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,510
break up.

532
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,019
Why?

533
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,420
I'm okay.

534
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,730
I know you'll try.

535
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:14,599
That's what you've done so far.

536
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,309
But while...

537
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,579
you suffered,

538
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,710
struggled...

539
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,780
and got hurt,

540
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,789
I never really understood...
why you put up with it.

541
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,429
I'm the problem.

542
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,639
I'm the one...

543
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,769
who should try.

544
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,780
I want to see you again
when I know...

545
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,590
that I can truly love you.

546
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,860
I can't do that right now.

547
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
Seeing you...

548
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,409
hurts a lot.

549
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,139
- Thank you. Come again.
- Have a nice day.

550
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:02,309
Joon. Is Seol still in her room?

551
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,579
Yes.

552
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:09,920
Her body's fine,

553
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,489
but her heart isn't.

554
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:15,820
No man should be trusted.

555
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,329
I said from the start that
I didn't like how he looked.

556
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:22,599
You must feel terrible that you lost
a rich potential son-in-law.

557
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,230
I didn't even dream of it.

558
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,440
Forget about the money.
I want a man...

559
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,110
who won't break my daughter's heart.

560
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,579
By the way, shouldn't you hire
a part-timer?

561
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,579
I wish In Ho would come back.

562
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:39,110
A lot of our regulars
came to see him.

563
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,320
Welcome.

564
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,619
What?

565
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,159
We were talking about you.

566
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,030
Here.

567
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,059
I didn't know your sizes.

568
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,230
What's this?

569
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,039
Long johns? My parents
aren't old enough to wear these.

570
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,170
I wanted to buy you a pair.

571
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,579
Thank you for everything.

572
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,409
I wish you good health.

573
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,949
In Ho.

574
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,619
Why don't you have some noodles?

575
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,230
No, thanks.

576
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,929
I have to go.
I have to be somewhere.

577
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,329
Yes. Have some noodles.

578
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,769
It won't take long.

579
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,769
Yes, sit down. Take advantage
of their generosity.

580
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,610
Dad, we might as well have dinner.

581
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,880
Yes, let's do that.

582
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:46,920
It's free only for today.
We expect you to pay next time.

583
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,989
Do what you do best, honey.

584
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,230
Are you asleep?

585
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,269
In Ho came by the store today.

586
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:13,179
He bought long johns.

587
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,309
They were so tacky.

588
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,210
I think he's a pretty nice guy.

589
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,320
Good night.

590
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,230
Sleep well.

591
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,849
Are you...

592
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,519
leaving?

593
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,420
I thought I should say bye.

594
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,730
Isn't your piano competition today?
I wish you the best of luck.

595
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,300
Bye.

596
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,139
Take care.

597
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,909
Don't get sick.

598
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,380
In Ho.

599
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,679
I won't...

600
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:01,820
have any regrets.

601
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,119
I hope...

602
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,019
you do the same.

603
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,030
Mad Hair.

604
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:15,699
You've grown up.

605
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,239
Thanks...

606
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:24,070
for showing me your smile.

607
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,039
(Grand Music Competition)

608
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,610
- In Ho.
- Sang Geun.

609
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,320
I meant to call sooner.

610
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,119
I'll wire you what I have.
Can you wait for the rest?

611
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,389
Don't worry about it.
Your attorney sorted it all out.

612
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:18,030
What do you mean?
What attorney?

613
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,699
Someone came and paid your debt.

614
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,329
He even left a document saying...

615
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:25,030
he'd sue us for blackmail
if we ever bothered you again.

616
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,400
Mang Chi froze when he saw it.

617
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,639
In Ho...

618
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,610
- Bye.
- Mang Chi what?

619
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,010
Go and eat.

620
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,849
Jung?

621
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:17,710
Did you say 200 hours of community
service? That's too light.

622
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:22,179
I heard that she also has to
pay a fine of about 5,000 dollars.

623
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,920
You said that an informal trial
would be fine.

624
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,389
Well, I said that because of In Ho.

625
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,460
Whenever I think about his sister,

626
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,829
my blood boils.

627
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:35,329
"Well, have a bowl of noodles
before you go."

628
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,099
Didn't you say that?

629
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,630
You ignored him at the hospital.

630
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,639
Shut it! You have to study!

631
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,309
Aren't you going to transfer?

632
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,710
I told you that I won't.

633
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,309
I'm just going to inherit
Mum's restaurant.

634
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,880
I'm going to learn cooking from her.

635
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:50,809
My goodness.

636
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,519
You're seriously...
You're shortening my life span.

637
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,719
Do I need to teach you
a lesson again? Goodness.

638
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,630
It's me, In Ha.

639
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,030
It may be a little too late
to say this now,

640
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,269
but I'm sorry for everything.

641
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,539
And Jung's flight
leaves at 3pm today.

642
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:17,639
I thought you should know.

643
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,500
Jung!

644
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:05,010
(3 years later)

645
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,820
After graduating, I got a job at
the company I wanted to work for.

646
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,619
But that was just getting through
one hurdle.

647
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:17,230
Things in my life are still intense
and repetitive at the same time.

648
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:19,789
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

649
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,929
Hey. Did you tie your hair up
because I like girls in ponytails?

650
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,739
What are you talking about?
That's such nonsense.

651
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:31,409
Tell me. Do you like me?

652
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:32,610
Goodness.

653
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:37,010
If you like me, just say so.

654
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,179
No matter where I go, there's
always someone like Yeong Gon.

655
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:43,619
Ms. Hong Seol.

656
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:45,889
No, you're a manager now.

657
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:50,030
You're the first one who got
the manage title amongst us.

658
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,329
Congratulations.

659
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,389
Thank you.

660
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,300
By the way, I like your coat.

661
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,829
Where did you get it?

662
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,369
There's also a co-worker
who is like Min Soo.

663
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,639
Well, I bought it at
one of the stores on the street.

664
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,099
I see.

665
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:06,010
Seol. You double-checked everything
I asked you to check...

666
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,010
on the financial statements, right?

667
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,010
I just finished going through them.

668
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,309
- Here.
- What?

669
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,480
You already finished it?

670
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:16,719
You're awesome. Thanks.

671
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:21,090
There's also a senior colleague
who reminds me of Sang Cheol.

672
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,230
Yes. Thanks to you, I pulled
an all-nighter last night.

673
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:26,929
There are still all these
relationships in my life,

674
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,530
and I still struggle with them.

675
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,739
But the passion and energy
to worry about small things...

676
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:36,099
have disappeared a long time ago.

677
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:40,110
Jae Woo, are you done for the day?

678
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,380
Yes. What about you?

679
00:55:41,409 --> 00:55:42,710
I still have a few things to finish.

680
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,510
Don't keep her waiting. We both know
how annoyed she will get.

681
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,079
I've talked to her about it,
but I can't change her personality.

682
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,719
Right,
I heard that In Ho got into...

683
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,519
the music department
at Sungan University.

684
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,719
It sounds like his hand
is completely healed, too.

685
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:57,889
I see.

686
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,190
I'll get going, then. See you.

687
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,260
- Bye.
- Bye.

688
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,730
- In Ha! In Ha!
- Ha Jae Woo!

689
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:04,269
What time is it now?

690
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:06,230
Gosh, I told you that
you can't act like this.

691
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,639
You said you'd be done in 5 minutes.
I waited for over 30 minutes!

692
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,639
It hasn't even been
five minutes yet.

693
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,579
How can you make a girl
wait for you like this?

694
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:15,679
I missed you so much.

695
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,710
- I missed you, too.
- I'm sure you did.

696
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,179
- Where are you taking me?
- Let's go for steak.

697
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,619
- I got paid today.
- Okay.

698
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,619
- Let's go.
- Yes!

699
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,889
Let's hurry.

700
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,489
Okay, don't hit me though.

701
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,130
Congratulations.

702
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:25,510
Nice!

703
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,190
Wow! Isn't the world-renowned
pianist, Mr. Baek In Ho, so amazing?

704
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:32,250
- Be quiet.
- Let me give you an advice.

705
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,590
- Play something more upbeat.
- Do you think this is a club?

706
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,019
Just play it.
Don't make me throw a fit.

707
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,429
- Jae Woo!
- Yes? Why?

708
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,900
The world-renowned pianist,
Mr. Baek In Ho, will...

709
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,929
play an upbeat, cheerful song
for us.

710
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,300
What did you say?
Yes, I'm his sister.

711
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:35,380
Seol! I have something to tell you.

712
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:37,119
Stop by my store after work.

713
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,360
- Tap.
- What are you doing?

714
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,460
- Tap.
- Gosh, stop it!

715
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,900
Eun Taek. You're here, too.

716
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:50,130
Oh, Seol!

717
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:51,500
It's been a while.

718
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,039
- Indeed.
- I rarely see him these days.

719
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,739
He has no time for dates.

720
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,269
Gosh, Eun Taek. Are you that busy
these days?

721
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,010
He even has an agent now.
He's having the time of his life.

722
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:03,909
Listen. If you become vain...

723
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,480
nd neglect her,
I'll teach you a lesson.

724
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,920
Why would I ever neglect her?

725
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:15,489
Hey, I have to find a gift
for Ah Young.

726
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:16,929
What's the gift for?

727
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,530
She's moving to the States.

728
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,130
Joon is devastated.
He's so upset right now.

729
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,730
- This is pretty.
- Seol, I have a gift for you.

730
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:29,340
- What? What is it?
- You can't reject it, okay?

731
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:31,909
This guy is totally awesome.

732
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,409
Ahn Chil Hyuk? Forget him.

733
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,780
- That one was obviously a mistake.
- That's right.

734
00:59:35,809 --> 00:59:36,809
You'll do it, right?

735
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:38,980
Stop talking nonsense.

736
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,079
Gosh, seriously.

737
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,780
- Cash me out, please.
- Will you be single forever?

738
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,349
You need to date and have some fun.

739
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,289
I'll figure it out, okay?

740
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,619
You should wear this to
the blind date. Get it for yourself.

741
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,019
It's for Ah Young.
Gift-wrap it, please.

742
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,530
- Just go on that blind date.
- You really should.

743
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,360
- If you do, this will be free.
- I can't give this to her for free.

744
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,099
I'll give you a discount.

745
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,730
Just gift-wrap it, please.

746
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,239
Gosh, you never listen to me.

747
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:04,139
But on the other hand,
the fact that...

748
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,409
meeting someone whom I want to get
to know is becoming more difficult,

749
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:13,010
and the fact that the passion in me
is gradually disappearing...

750
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,519
are making me sad.

751
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:45,880
Did I ever...

752
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:50,590
struggle so hard
to get to know someone?

753
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:57,590
The time it took me
to understand and accept Jung...

754
01:00:58,889 --> 01:00:59,960
No.

755
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:05,670
Jung might need even
more time than that.

756
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:10,099
Seol, dinner's ready.

757
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,869
- Come and eat.
- Okay.

758
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:21,750
(Read)

759
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,119
Seol.

760
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:31,030
(Thank you for watching
Cheese in the Trap.)
