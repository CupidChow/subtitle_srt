1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,610
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,750
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,679
Do you want to go for food? Let's go.

4
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:18,690
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,789
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,100
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,600
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,000
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,009
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,549
So what?

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,689
Baek In Ho.

12
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,259
So what?

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,239
Do you want to play the piano?

14
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,489
I asked you a question.

15
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,989
Jung, don't be so abrupt.

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,359
Why are you here?

17
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,799
Professor Shin asked us to give you this.

18
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,980
You must want to play
if that's where you went.

19
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,879
Shut your mouth.

20
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,510
Why do you care what I do?

21
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,480
Study abroad.
I'll pay for the expenses.

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,390
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,489
It's because I think
you changed your mind.

24
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,560
If you're trying to keep it from me
out of pride, don't.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,530
Jung.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,969
Why would you say it like that?

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,629
What do you mean?

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,669
It sounds like you want to pick a fight.

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,810
We got the professor's business card.

30
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,050
All you had to do was give it to him.

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,120
Why would you tell him to go study abroad?

32
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,250
He used to play the piano well
and I just feel sorry for him.

33
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,590
Feel sorry for me?

34
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,060
I feel more sorry for you.

35
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,159
Stop it.

36
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:41,129
I know that what went on between you
is none of my business,

37
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,300
but I really want the both of you
to just stop it.

38
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,770
I'm done.

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,439
If he refuses now, it's over.

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
Listen.

41
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,349
I don't care what you end up doing.

42
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,689
But don't waste Seol's time
because you can't make up your mind.

43
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,360
Do you think life is that easy?

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,800
Live your own life.

45
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,400
Get out of my sight.

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,210
Let's go.

47
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,280
Come on.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,240
(Episode 8)

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,610
You two fight whenever you meet,

50
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,509
but I don't think it's because
you hate each other.

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,879
Can't you talk it out with him?

52
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't want you and In Ho to be friends.

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,100
I don't want you to take sides
or feel bothered.

54
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,279
Let's not talk about this.

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,790
Tomorrow's my last day on campus.

56
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,790
That's not good.

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,399
But then, we don't have to meet on campus.

58
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,600
We can date elsewhere.

59
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,610
Shall we have dinner tomorrow?

60
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,980
Sure.

61
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,009
Go home.

62
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,420
You leave first.

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,350
After you.

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,920
I always go inside first.
This time you go first.

65
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,889
- Let's both leave.
- What?

66
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,699
Bye.

67
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,759
Me, play the piano?

68
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,709
(Could Professor Hwang's students
please come to room 401?)

69
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,879
Thank you.

70
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Why didn't you use your own phone?

71
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,560
I left it at home.

72
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,860
- Min Soo.
- What?

73
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,800
You changed your style.

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,069
- Do I look weird?
- No.

75
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,139
I love it.
You look beautiful.

76
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,339
High-five.
See you around.

77
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,110
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

78
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,110
Does she think she's Seol?

79
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,519
That's just unbelievable.

80
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,990
Hello, Jung.

81
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,300
- Did you call me?
- Me?

82
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,629
When?

83
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,470
I saw you in the corridor
and followed you in here.

84
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,209
Doesn't your internship begin next week?

85
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,209
I had something to tell you
and I'm glad I got the chance.

86
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,720
Go ahead.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,850
I bet you're enjoying life.

88
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,220
You did fine before,

89
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,060
but now you're an intern
at a nice company and you're dating.

90
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,860
Considering all that,

91
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,000
I really don't believe you once tried
to set me up with Seol.

92
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,629
How can you be so shameless?

93
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
Is this why everyone loves you?

94
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,310
Because you duped them?

95
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,610
This.

96
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,879
- Did you send it?
- What?

97
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:55,879
No.

98
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't know what you're up to.

99
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,389
Will you quit the act?

100
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,389
You toyed with Seol long enough.

101
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:14,329
You don't even like her.

102
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,370
You'll dump her and make her
take a break like you made me.

103
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,439
What are you talking about?

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,870
Come on now.

105
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,110
The texts you sent me last year.

106
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,519
I have proof so don't deny it.

107
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,450
Fine.

108
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,259
Seol must like you.

109
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,960
Tell her you like her, too.

110
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,299
She likes gifts.
Spend a lot on her.

111
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,830
Is she on holiday?
Go to her language institute.

112
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,610
I had them all saved.

113
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,610
How do you think Seol
will react when she sees this?

114
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,250
Will she stay with you
even after she finds out...

115
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,580
that you set me on her?

116
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,519
Did you just flinch?
You're scared, aren't you?

117
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,090
I got you.

118
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:18,059
It's not exactly true
that I'm the stalker.

119
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,129
I think you're very mistaken.

120
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,700
I never sent those texts.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,299
You think denying it
is going to help you?

122
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Well, think again.

123
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,470
I'm actually surprised
at how careless you are.

124
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,409
Pick up.
Don't keep me waiting.

125
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:34,909
Hello?

126
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,210
Hello?

127
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,350
Hey.

128
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,220
What do you want? Speak up!

129
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,389
It's your number.

130
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,129
What are you trying to prove?

131
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,000
You jerk.
How long will you keep up this act?

132
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,870
You're trash and I know
what you're capable of.

133
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,070
What do you think you're doing?

134
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,440
You said you'd buy us meat.

135
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,570
Did you change your mind?

136
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,809
Are you out of your mind?

137
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,210
It's nothing.

138
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,110
What's going on?

139
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,179
You know how Yeong Gon
used to have a thing for Seol.

140
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,620
- What?
- You're dating Da Young.

141
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,889
Are you still bothering Seol?

142
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,289
It's not like that.
Look at this.

143
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,389
Jung sent me these texts.

144
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,789
Let me see.

145
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,899
Jung doesn't send texts like this.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,970
You probably sent it to yourself.

147
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,500
What are you talking about?

148
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,470
The phone number's different.

149
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,009
- See? It's different.
- You're right.

150
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,309
Jung, did you change your number?

151
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,779
Idiot.

152
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:43,049
What are you plotting now?

153
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,580
Stop scheming.

154
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,720
Yeong Gon!

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,389
You're such a jerk!

156
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,759
There's a huge misunderstanding.

157
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,659
A misunderstanding? You're such a psycho.

158
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,759
This is unbelievable.

159
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,799
- Come back here.
- Da Young.

160
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,159
Why are you even here?

161
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,200
I will never eat the food you buy.

162
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,740
Do Hyun, you buy instead.
Let's go eat some meat.

163
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,440
Meat sounds good, right?

164
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,639
That digital recorder.

165
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,409
It's such a cheap trick.

166
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,950
I think you're the careless one.

167
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm quite baffled.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Jung, it's me.
I'm Yeong Gon.

169
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,940
Everyone else ignores me now.

170
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,080
Thank you for forgiving me
and giving me your number.

171
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,240
Are you not close with your classmates?

172
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,980
I thought you and Seol
got along just fine.

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,279
Did you notice?

174
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,289
Seol had been looking out for me recently.

175
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,590
I think she has feelings for me.
What do you think?

176
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,460
Maybe she likes you.

177
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,559
Who are you texting with my phone?

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,899
Is it a girl? Tell me who it is.

179
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,169
It's a guy.

180
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,700
Oh.
I thought it was a girl.

181
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,070
Which guy keeps texting you?

182
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,909
Who's Yeong Gon?

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,580
Who's Seol? Who are these people?

184
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,879
Tell me who they are.
Which one of the two is bothering you?

185
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,519
Both.

186
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,889
Both?

187
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,960
Why don't you hook up Seol
with this loser?

188
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,460
Do you want me to do it for you?
I'm good at these things.

189
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,059
I'm an expert.
I'll do it for you.

190
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,370
Confess your feelings to her.

191
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,039
That's exactly how you sound
when you text.

192
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,110
I'm going to press send, okay?

193
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,850
This should entertain me for a while.

194
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,860
He called me with this number last time.

195
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,129
Why did a girl pick up instead?

196
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,370
That scumbag.

197
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,639
He must have deliberately called me
from someone else's phone.

198
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:20,169
Wait.

199
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,070
I wonder who this girl is.

200
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,909
A mistress? An ex?

201
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,120
He's cheating on her.

202
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,720
You're so smart, Yeong Gon.

203
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,429
Did they really think I'd fall for it?

204
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,629
Jung.

205
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,549
I like it here.
It's nice and quiet.

206
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,419
I heard what Yeong Gon did to you today.

207
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,929
Everyone's talking about it.

208
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,759
What a weirdo.

209
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,070
- You're struggling as it is.
- Seol.

210
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,639
You need to be strong and wary
once I start the internship.

211
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,980
If something happens, call me right away.

212
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,649
Why did you smile?

213
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,649
Because I'm happy.

214
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,850
So this is how it feels to have someone
who cares for me.

215
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,629
Don't you worry.
I'll be fine without you.

216
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Cheers.

217
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,759
- Good.
- Look.

218
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,929
Who do we have here? Look over there.

219
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,970
Sit, sit.
Do Hyun, sit down.

220
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,840
What are you two doing here?

221
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,409
How about a farewell party for Jung?

222
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,240
- Hello.
- He got an internship...

223
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,779
and a girlfriend.

224
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:08,950
- Three bottles of soju, please.
- Sure.

225
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,720
Seol, let me pour you a cup of beer.

226
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,350
She can't drink that well.

227
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,789
How sweet of him.

228
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,860
He's drinking it for her.

229
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,659
You're drinking it all?

230
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:24,399
Bravo.

231
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,669
You must really like her.

232
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,370
Hang on.

233
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,470
Shouldn't we see some proof
of their relationship?

234
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,370
- Like a kiss?
- You two should kiss.

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,080
- Don't be shy and kiss.
- Oh, come on.

236
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,610
- Go on.
- Kiss her.

237
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,450
- Sure.
- You will?

238
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes, if you two kiss each other first.

239
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,789
- What? No way. Never.
- Hey.

240
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,960
- I don't want to, either.
- Why not?

241
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,860
Then don't make us do it either.

242
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,899
It's not fair to force her
to do something she doesn't want to.

243
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,299
- Yes. He's right.
- Fine.

244
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,529
- Let's drink.
- Good idea.

245
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,169
I could drink forever.

246
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm a good drinker.

247
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,009
This is great.
You know...

248
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,480
Are you all right? Are you drunk?

249
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,620
My head hurts and it's loud in here.

250
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,559
Your head? What should we do?

251
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,960
It's so noisy.

252
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
So noisy.

253
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,669
It's noisy.

254
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,639
Hang on.
Can you sit up?

255
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,210
He must be drunk.

256
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,080
Let's go out and get some fresh air.

257
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,590
- Where are you going?
- What's wrong?

258
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,690
We need some fresh air.

259
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,259
- What?
- Okay.

260
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,960
Is he drunk already?

261
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,029
Is the air outside fresh?

262
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,829
Don't stay out too long.

263
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,660
Do you know I liked her?

264
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,500
- Stop it.
- I did.

265
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,339
I think you drank too much.

266
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,240
Let's sit on this bench.

267
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,509
Be careful.

268
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,200
Jung.

269
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,200
Shall we just ditch them?

270
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,710
I don't want to drink with them.

271
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,680
They think we're pushovers.

272
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,539
Pushover?

273
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,980
Kids called me that in high school.

274
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,450
Really?

275
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,849
Yes.

276
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,819
People only approached me
whenever they wanted something.

277
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,630
I could tell right away,

278
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,000
but I just went along with it.

279
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,039
It was easier that way.

280
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,049
Do you like me
from the bottom of your heart?

281
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,650
You do, right?

282
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,269
At first...

283
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,970
I thought you were just the same.

284
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,640
You used to hate me.

285
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,819
I'm not a bad guy.

286
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,369
Jung.

287
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:26,470
It's okay.
No one's watching.

288
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,670
I shouldn't think about playing the piano.

289
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,940
Mad Hair.

290
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,609
Hello.

291
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,579
What got into you? Shouldn't you come in?

292
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,589
It's too late.

293
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,349
It is.

294
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,259
What did the professor say
when he gave you his business card?

295
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:27,900
Yes.

296
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,069
What's wrong with you?
Why are you alone? Where's Jung?

297
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,339
What?

298
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,140
Have you been drinking?

299
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,410
- What?
- You stink.

300
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,980
How much did you drink?

301
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,779
You said you wouldn't go in.

302
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,450
Where are you going?

303
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,880
- I'm going home.
- Home?

304
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:54,059
Has she lost her mind?
How much did she drink?

305
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,829
She reeks of alcohol.

306
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,299
I wonder if Jung got home safely.

307
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,970
Did you get home safely?

308
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
I guess he's really drunk.

309
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,759
(Good night, Seol.)

310
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,029
Good night?

311
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,430
How can you sleep?

312
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Sure.

313
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,940
I guess kissing isn't a big deal for you.

314
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,079
I can't sleep because
I keep thinking of that moment.

315
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,789
Good for him.

316
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,200
Da Young, we need to talk.

317
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,299
Let go.
I have nothing to say to you.

318
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,200
Da Young, please.

319
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,769
You got it all wrong.

320
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,869
I have no feelings for Seol whatsoever.

321
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,579
- Don't you believe me?
- Of course not.

322
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:55,609
- Da Young, wait.
- Yeong Gon.

323
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,150
Did you apologise to Jung?

324
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,549
You haven't changed at all.

325
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,890
I feel sorry for Jung
for getting involved with him.

326
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,960
Take it easy, will you?

327
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,559
Stop chasing girls around.

328
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,329
- Hey, where are you going?
- That jerk, Jung.

329
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,430
What's so amazing about him?

330
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,470
They didn't even ask
about my part of the story.

331
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,869
It's always about Jung!

332
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,779
I thought I'd finally
gotten on their good side.

333
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,230
Today, we'll look into
a few basic principles.

334
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,769
There's sunk cost and opportunity cost.

335
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,500
- Sunk cost is...
- Scoot over.

336
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,880
Are you still upset?

337
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,410
Get over it already.

338
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm sorry about what I said last year.

339
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:05,849
Are we cool?

340
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,289
I can't hear what the professor is saying.

341
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,420
Come on.
We're on the same side.

342
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,319
We're comrades.
We both liked Bo Ra.

343
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,430
She is charming.

344
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,400
She's short but sensual,
and she's very curvy.

345
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,369
Do you know that? I do.

346
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,069
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't know.

347
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,170
I'll show you something.

348
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,140
I took some photos of her last year.

349
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,779
They're a bit too revealing
to show just anyone.

350
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,890
What do you think you're doing?

351
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,190
Stop it.

352
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,160
- Get out, both of you.
- Are you okay?

353
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,029
What's wrong with you?

354
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,839
This is proof that me and Seol
are destined for each other.

355
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,180
I'll give it back to her during lunch.

356
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,480
It's almost as cute as Seol.

357
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,960
Seol, you're here early.

358
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,130
I'm not Seol.

359
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:29,869
I must look a lot like her.

360
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,599
Seol. Hello.

361
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,470
Do you want to eat lunch together?

362
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,210
I have something to tell you.

363
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,309
Sit over here.

364
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,410
Let's sit in the back.

365
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,660
If you act like that in the military,
you'd be in big trouble.

366
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,359
You can stop now.
I upset him last year, remember?

367
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,529
That's right.
You hit him with a ball last year.

368
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,829
Kids these days scare me.

369
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,670
You'd hit him over a girl?

370
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,470
- Apologise to Yeong Gon.
- But he...

371
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,039
- My face hurts so much.
- Hurry up and apologise.

372
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,940
Should I make you?

373
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,319
- Sorry.
- Say it like you mean it.

374
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,349
Don't say it to us.
Say it to Yeong Gon.

375
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,460
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,059
I'll be fine.

377
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,529
Yeong Gon, where are you?

378
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,660
I'm over here.

379
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,170
- Yeong Gon.
- Da Young.

380
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,369
I heard what happened.

381
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:42,369
- Look at your face.
- It hurts.

382
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:47,240
What the heck is the matter with you?

383
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,779
- Let's get your face looked at.
- Okay.

384
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:55,190
I was lying about those photos, you moron.

385
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:56,990
- Don't.
- Bye.

386
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,059
- Watch your temper.
- Hey.

387
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,359
Don't forget to finish your project plan
by next week.

388
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,230
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

389
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,269
This is no laughing matter.

390
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,539
If I mistook her for you,
then anyone would make the mistake.

391
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:17,470
Shouldn't you say something?

392
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,339
What would I say?

393
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,779
- She just dresses a bit like me.
- What?

394
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,579
Look at her hair.

395
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,579
She looks just like you from head to toe.

396
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,250
Seol.

397
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,559
Let's eat lunch together.
I have something to tell you.

398
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,230
She's eating with me.

399
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:40,559
I'm sorry.

400
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,970
You dropped it last time.

401
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,299
Hey, isn't that yours?

402
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,710
Did you take it, Min Soo?

403
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,440
- What?
- Hey.

404
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,079
First you dress like her,
now you steal from her?

405
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,079
- Stop it.
- Say something.

406
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,150
- Don't.
- It's mine.

407
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,589
It's yours?

408
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,359
Yes.
I bought it.

409
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:07,960
Why?

410
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,660
Did you buy it yourself?

411
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,660
- If you found it somewhere...
- No.

412
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,730
It looked cute, so I bought it.

413
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,630
Where?

414
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,539
At the store outside our campus.

415
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,609
You guys are really weird.

416
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,180
Hey.

417
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,980
What's wrong with her?

418
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,950
She's unbelievable.

419
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,579
I bet she's lying.

420
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:40,019
He told me to come,
but why isn't he inside?

421
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,559
Excuse me.

422
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,829
Yes?

423
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,069
Where is Professor Shin?

424
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,569
I don't know.

425
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,069
- Hello, Professor.
- Hi there.

426
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:59,440
You're back.

427
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,140
Come in.

428
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,119
Here she comes.

429
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,430
Stupid me.

430
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,660
I should've just given it back.

431
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,660
No.

432
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,170
They accused me first.

433
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,869
I'm not trying to look like anyone.
Why would I?

434
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,970
Min Soo?

435
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,470
It is you.

436
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,779
Yeong Gon.

437
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,509
Is something wrong?

438
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:39,079
What's with the worried look on your face?

439
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,450
Are you in need of sugar? Here, have this.

440
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,190
Cheer up.

441
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,660
I really was going to give it back.

442
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,559
But then they ganged up on me.

443
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,930
I got flustered
and blurted a load of nonsense.

444
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,940
I really wanted to be friends with Seol.

445
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,640
It's all gone wrong now.
What should I do?

446
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,579
Why do you want to be her friend?

447
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:10,450
She looks pretty even though
she doesn't wear expensive clothes.

448
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,380
She gets good grades
and doesn't boast about it.

449
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,490
- And she's so sweet.
- No.

450
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,319
I don't think so.

451
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,759
Why not?

452
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,460
You did nothing wrong,
but they accused you...

453
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,059
of stealing something from her.
How is that being sweet?

454
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,470
- Is it not?
- I think you're much sweeter.

455
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,940
She gives you a hard time,
but you're always defending her.

456
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,039
- Am I?
- Yes.

457
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,579
And Seol's been...

458
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,680
going around complaining
that you look like her now.

459
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,190
I think she's the one who's copying you.

460
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,259
- Really?
- Yes.

461
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,430
Her good grades?

462
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,859
When there's a team project
and she's the team leader,

463
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,859
she makes the others do all the work.
What kind of a leader is that?

464
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,869
I thought about it and...

465
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,799
she is better than you
in no way whatsoever.

466
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,509
Other than having a boyfriend.

467
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:12,579
She thinks her boyfriend
makes her special.

468
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,950
How long do you think that'll last?
A month? Maybe two?

469
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,049
Seol's just using Jung for her own good.

470
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,349
I did wonder why they'd gotten together.

471
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,160
Right? See, you're incredibly smart.

472
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,019
All you need is confidence.

473
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,230
Talk to me whenever someone
or something bothers you.

474
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:33,359
You know how open-minded I am.

475
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,660
- Right?
- Yes.

476
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,130
I have to go now.
See you.

477
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,769
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

478
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,509
Is she naive or just plain stupid?

479
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,839
It looks like
she'll give Seol a hard time.

480
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:51,980
Jung will be busy
slaving away as an intern.

481
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,750
It's my world.

482
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,259
Just a little encouragement...

483
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,359
This is unbelievable.
She might even ask me out.

484
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,769
And I'll pretend to be cool
and think about it.

485
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,940
These are chocolates from Belgium.

486
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,539
- Wow.
- And...

487
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,509
this is herbal tea from Holland.

488
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,809
I bought those for you.

489
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:24,480
Thank you so much.

490
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,890
How was your trip?

491
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,690
It was fantastic.

492
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:32,859
I focused on
all the galleries and museums.

493
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,559
Seeing the actual paintings
and not the pictures...

494
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,190
was so overwhelming.

495
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,230
What about you? How was your holiday?

496
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,269
- It was...
- Seol.

497
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,839
Did you take
Labour Management class last year?

498
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,809
Could you lend me your notes?

499
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,150
I took the class last year.

500
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,279
- I'm not sure if...
- Wait.

501
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,980
Who's she?

502
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,519
Say hi.
He's one of my seniors.

503
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,319
Hello, I'm Kang Ah Young.

504
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,559
Hello.

505
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,130
Are the two of you close with each other?

506
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,769
- Yes.
- Really?

507
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,869
Yes.
My notes...

508
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,970
- from last year are...
- Hello. I'm Kim Sang Cheol.

509
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm the person that Seol trusts
and relies on the most.

510
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,950
So, Ah Young.

511
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,880
You must be an Art major.

512
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,579
Yes.
I'm in my first year.

513
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,950
So you must paint.

514
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,190
You're just my type.

515
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,059
- Your class starts in five minutes.
- I know that.

516
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,160
It's fine.
So, have you eaten lunch?

517
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,029
Would you like some steak?

518
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:48,430
We have to go somewhere.

519
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,869
- Let's go. We're late.
- But...

520
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,869
- Can I have your number?
- Bye.

521
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,470
I'll see you again next time.

522
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,940
I found her at last.

523
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,960
I heard you took a long break.
I can tell.

524
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,670
- What do you mean?
- You lack the skill.

525
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,210
You took a break for five years?
What did you do during that time?

526
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,820
I don't see
why I have to put up with this.

527
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,679
Are you not impressed?

528
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:45,289
- You begged to see me.
- That's why you came?

529
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:48,159
We're done here.
You can leave now.

530
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,429
Professor.

531
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,599
- Hello.
- Hi, Yeo Joon.

532
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,829
Come on in.

533
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,570
Your concert's coming up.
How do you feel?

534
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,239
I'm practising as much as I can,
but I'm nervous.

535
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,170
Can I do this?

536
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,440
Of course.
You'll do just fine.

537
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,139
Sit.

538
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,980
You can go now.

539
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,449
I'm leaving.

540
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,190
See you tomorrow.

541
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,559
- Don't be late.
- I won't. Bye.

542
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,929
Jung, how's your first day at work?

543
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm working.

544
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,500
It was your first day working
at the library. How was it?

545
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,369
It was okay.

546
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:10,909
What's the point? Anyone could do it.

547
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,550
It was the first thing we got as a couple.

548
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,179
In Ho.

549
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,860
Why are you here?

550
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,460
Oh, did you come to see the professor?

551
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,480
Is something wrong?

552
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,349
I don't know.

553
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,760
Don't you ever get sick of it?

554
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you study on the tube, too?

555
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,699
What are you trying to become?

556
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:14,500
I just want to get a job.
I don't want to be jobless.

557
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,610
Stop worrying so much.
You're still a student.

558
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,440
That's what I used to think.

559
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,380
I thought I could be anything
I wanted once I went to university.

560
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,690
But now that I'm in university,
everything just gets harder.

561
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:32,420
I envy people like them.

562
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,530
What for? They look like workaholics.

563
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,730
What about you?
Have you ever envied someone?

564
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,469
Never.

565
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,900
I can tell.
You're talented.

566
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,639
I'm not, so I have to try
really hard at everything.

567
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,079
Why do you try so hard?

568
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,110
I mean, how do you try hard?

569
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:00,679
How?

570
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,119
You just keep trying.

571
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,320
You just do.

572
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,559
Why don't I do that?

573
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,000
You must be a genius.

574
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:18,070
Hi, Jung.

575
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,769
Now?

576
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,239
Jung.

577
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,780
Why are you here?

578
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,909
Did you come with him?

579
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,579
- He came to our university.
- Hey.

580
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,289
- Don't talk nonsense.
- It's the truth.

581
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:40,860
It felt strange
not being with you all day.

582
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,860
What a joke.

583
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:48,900
You must have been busy
since it was your first day.

584
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,530
I've never been here before.

585
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:53,469
Right.

586
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:55,570
Can I eat dinner here?

587
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,670
Of course.

588
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,809
But...

589
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,780
my parents will be here.

590
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,449
Then I'll say hi.

591
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,090
- What?
- What?

592
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,590
Are you kidding me?

593
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,659
We need to work.
Get lost.

594
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,159
I'm hungry.

595
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,260
Where do you think you're going?

596
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,670
Let me get this straight.
So you are my daughter's...

597
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,869
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

598
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,809
My name is Yu Jung.

599
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,710
In Ho, can you turn off the faucet.

600
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,949
Thank you for the flower...

601
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,380
In Ho, can you keep it down?

602
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,190
I was curious who the boyfriend was.

603
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,960
You're very handsome.

604
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,800
You must be in your fourth year.

605
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,969
Are you looking for a job?

606
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
Yes.
I'm currently interning.

607
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,340
That's not a full-time job.

608
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,739
What do your parents do?

609
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,469
Dad.

610
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,579
Stop asking such questions.

611
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,079
She's right.
We just met him.

612
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,550
Don't pinch me.
It hurts.

613
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,889
Can't I ask my daughter's boyfriend
what his parents do?

614
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,159
It's fine, I don't mind.

615
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,829
My father owns a company.

616
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,260
A company? What kind?

617
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,630
Taerang Group.

618
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,469
- Taerang Group?
- Taerang?

619
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,039
The one we know?

620
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,880
Mum.

621
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,349
Can you get us some water?
You're thirsty, right?

622
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,250
In Ho.
Bring some water.

623
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,329
Sorry about that.

624
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,869
It's fine.

625
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:13,539
Your father owns a large company.

626
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,349
Did you say your name is Jung?
Have you eaten?

627
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,650
Would you like some noodles?

628
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:25,090
Yes, please.
Seol brags about your cooking.

629
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,360
I've always wanted to try.

630
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,250
Do you eat noodles in anchovy broth?

631
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,449
I do.
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

632
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:00,420
Don't worry.
Enjoy.

633
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:04,389
Thank you.

634
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:08,030
How long have you two been dating?

635
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,699
About two and a half months.

636
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,170
Oh, I see.

637
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,309
Eat up.

638
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:21,079
Are you the eldest son?

639
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,679
I'm an only child.

640
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,320
- That looks delicious.
- Turn the TV off.

641
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,849
Will you inherit the company?

642
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,789
- Stop that.
- Hey.

643
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,559
- This is delicious.
- Really?

644
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,559
Try the kimchi.
I just made it.

645
00:42:36,659 --> 00:42:38,289
The kimchi is good.

646
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,769
- It's good.
- Right?

647
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:47,969
- My mum made it.
- Do you have housemaids?

648
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,139
Mum.

649
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,940
- He's eating.
- Oh, right.

650
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,610
You know how to eat well.
Try the broth.

651
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,079
It's delicious.

652
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:04,989
It won't be after 20 years.

653
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,860
Thank you for the food.

654
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,829
You should stay for some fruit.

655
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,230
It's late.

656
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,460
What's the rush?

657
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,300
Would you like some tea?

658
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,070
Do we have tea?

659
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,670
Honey...

660
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,940
I should go.
Bye.

661
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,440
Bye, then.

662
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,980
Enjoy your date.

663
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,880
I'll just see him off.

664
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,880
- Don't be too late.
- I won't.

665
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:31,980
See you.

666
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,050
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

667
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,489
I love him.

668
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,789
He's just perfect in every way.

669
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,289
It'd be awesome
if the two of them got married.

670
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,130
Joon, stop talking nonsense.

671
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,630
He's in a different league than us.

672
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,010
Where did In Ho go?

673
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,880
There you are.
Where were you?

674
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,010
In the alley.

675
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,219
What's wrong with you?
Why are you always complaining?

676
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,760
He's polite, handsome
and he isn't a picky eater.

677
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:20,059
Gosh.

678
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,769
And why would you turn on the TV
while we were talking?

679
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,570
I can't believe you.

680
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,869
You said we had tea.
Bring me a cup.

681
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,210
If those two get married,
we might have to live in his debt.

682
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,780
What were you thinking?

683
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,079
You took a break for five years?

684
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,050
What did you do during that time?

685
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,789
What did I do?

686
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,960
I apologise for all the questions
that my dad asked.

687
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,630
It's okay.
It's not like I had anything to hide.

688
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:01,940
That's a relief.

689
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,139
Your parents are nice.

690
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,809
I'm glad you think so.

691
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,489
Did you get home safely yesterday?

692
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,489
You were kind of drunk.

693
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,130
Yes.
I got home safely and slept well.

694
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,030
And I went to work on time.

695
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,130
Could it be...

696
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:31,769
that he doesn't remember
about what happened yesterday?

697
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,070
Seol.

698
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,000
Yes?

699
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,710
Did In Ho say
if he'll come to the university often?

700
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:41,780
In Ho?

701
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,349
I'm not sure.
He didn't say anything to me.

702
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:53,090
It was our first kiss.
Has he really forgotten?

703
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,360
Does he not remember?

704
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,260
What are you thinking about?

705
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,300
Nothing.

706
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,769
Drive safely.

707
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,949
Just so you know, I didn't forget.
I remember everything.

708
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,579
See you.

709
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,059
- He has a lot of talent.
- Yes, I agree.

710
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,360
- He has a bright future.
- Yes.

711
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,230
Have a nice day.

712
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:14,969
In Ho, you're back.

713
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,239
Do you want to try again?

714
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,480
I want to learn.

715
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,079
I see.
Come inside.

716
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,630
- These are the basic scales.
- Yes.

717
00:47:43,329 --> 00:47:46,170
I played the piano for many years.
You expect me to play this?

718
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:47,369
You don't want to?

719
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,340
Fine, I'll do it.

720
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,909
Stay and practise
until I'm back from my lecture.

721
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:56,280
When will that be?

722
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,110
Professor.

723
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,579
Unbelievable.

724
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:06,190
He calls himself a professor?

725
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,960
Why should I practise this?

726
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,829
Does he think I'm a novice?

727
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,800
Fine, I'll do it.

728
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,679
I don't have time to fool around.

729
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:32,849
A five-year break isn't...

730
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,250
Okay, fine.
Let's do it.

731
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,960
Oh, come on.

732
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:51,869
Do I have to do this?

733
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:14,760
In Ho came to see me.

734
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,070
He's a bit rusty though.

735
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,170
- His hands are stiff, right?
- Yes.

736
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:33,010
You know how stubborn he can be.

737
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,510
Could you do me a favour?

738
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:41,380
Could you teach him that patience...

739
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,360
is the best talent of all?

740
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,079
It still aches every now and then.

741
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,179
Don't act like that in the military.

742
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,449
You can't go around beating people up.

743
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,619
Bo Ra.

744
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,119
Manage Eun Taek properly.

745
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,030
- What do you mean?
- Don't you know?

746
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:26,260
He punched Yeong Gon again because of you.

747
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,130
All he does is punch people.

748
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,170
You should just go out with him.

749
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,539
You might think that you're pretty,

750
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,539
but take a closer look in the mirror,
okay?

751
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:43,380
What?

752
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:47,480
She's just as crazy as Yeong Gon.

753
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,989
I saw Eun Taek apologising
and bowing to the seniors.

754
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:56,690
He was also
getting their coffees for them.

755
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,260
As if he did something wrong.

756
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,760
So I asked what he did,
but he wouldn't say.

757
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,300
He told me not to care.

758
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:06,170
I'm sure Yeong Gon did something to him.

759
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:09,170
What's wrong with that guy?

760
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,210
I hate him.

761
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,639
Someone needs to teach him a lesson.

762
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,010
There goes your wannabe.

763
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,780
Son Min Soo.

764
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,880
Are you still trying to be Seol?

765
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,119
What do you mean? Why would I?

766
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,260
Seol, aren't you the one who's copying me?

767
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,590
- What?
- Never mind.

768
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,130
She's so weird.
Hey!

769
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,369
She must be out of her mind.

770
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:40,969
I'm sick and tired of her and Yeong Gon.

771
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,570
Gosh.

772
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,969
Why won't you say anything to her?

773
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,780
That's why she thinks you're a pushover.

774
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:50,980
Ask her about the doll later.

775
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,949
Don't just stand there.
Do something about it.

776
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,789
There's Jung.

777
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,460
Jung.

778
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:10,469
I went over all the material you sent me.

779
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,170
Bo Ra,
the video you sent is a bit too long.

780
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:15,670
Shorten it for me.

781
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,269
Sure.

782
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,809
She's never precise.

783
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,010
I might have to nag a lot.

784
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,280
Kyung Han,
you looked into authoritative leadership.

785
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,380
It wasn't enough.
We need a little more information.

786
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:31,789
Endlessly optimistic lazybone.

787
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,260
It's all down to how I control him.

788
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,659
Sang Cheol.

789
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,630
He's just hopeless.

790
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,170
Where's the CEO case study?
It was due yesterday.

791
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:48,039
- You still haven't finished it?
- Check your phone.

792
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,780
Give me Ah Young's number.

793
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,809
I'm really sorry.

794
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,519
I had a family emergency yesterday.

795
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:03,019
Why are you always like this?

796
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,789
You had the least to do.

797
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,659
I said I'm sorry.

798
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,329
I have a lot of things on my mind,
so I didn't have the time.

799
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,829
About tracking down
an appropriate case study.

800
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,369
Could you do it for me, Seol?

801
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:20,269
- You want her to do it for you?
- Again?

802
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,539
Does he think I'm a pushover?

803
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:27,579
If you don't do any work this time,
I'll cut you from the team.

804
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,079
- What?
- You heard what the professor said.

805
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,079
We're allowed to omit the names of people
who didn't participate.

806
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:39,590
- I'll do as she said.
- I don't believe this.

807
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,530
It's not like I didn't do it on purpose.

808
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,059
I said I had a family emergency!

809
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,360
Is this how you want it to be?

810
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,760
Be quiet.
It's your fault this happened.

811
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,570
Why are you yelling?

812
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,900
You're the reason
she failed last semester, remember?

813
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:57,809
If we fail again this semester,
it'll be your fault.

814
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,769
How dare you?

815
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,079
Seol.

816
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:05,150
Don't you dare
threaten me like that again.

817
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,980
Send me the case study within the day.

818
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,389
- I will.
- By what time?

819
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:13,119
Yeong Gon's right.
She's deceiving everyone.

820
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:15,460
She isn't a good person at all.

821
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,860
Look at her push them around.

822
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,960
Let's proceed with the others.

823
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:22,159
Okay!

824
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,929
I looked at what we have so far...

825
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:29,300
Min Soo, I read everything you sent.

826
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,409
You did?

827
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,510
You did a lot of research.

828
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,679
But a lot of the stuff were unrelated.

829
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,079
I did some editing and sent it back.
Did you check your inbox?

830
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,179
Not yet.

831
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,389
Check it later today.

832
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:47,760
I also sent links to a few websites.

833
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,760
If you need help, call me.

834
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,460
I will.

835
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,130
I'll work really hard.

836
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,539
Hey wannabe, we need to talk.

837
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,670
About what?

838
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,380
- Bo Ra.
- I got this.

839
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,050
We have to get to the bottom of this.

840
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,579
Could we go somewhere quiet to talk?

841
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,190
Stay here.

842
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,460
No.
Let's talk right here.

843
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,030
- What is it?
- Okay.

844
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:28,300
That lion doll.
Is it really yours?

845
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,099
We went to the store and they said
they don't sell those dolls.

846
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,570
- What?
- I thought it looked...

847
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:37,070
a lot like the one I'd lost.

848
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,909
Do you mind if I have a look at it?

849
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,480
Are you sure you didn't pick it up?

850
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:45,980
If Seol asks about it again,
raise your voice.

851
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,480
She hates being the centre of attention.

852
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,889
And people with loud voices
always win the argument.

853
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:55,119
I didn't pick it up.
What's your problem?

854
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,130
You go around complaining
that I look like you,

855
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,929
and now you call me a thief.

856
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,900
You have some serious issues.

857
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,769
Why would I dress like you?
And I really did...

858
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,469
buy the doll at that store.

859
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,769
Watch what you say.
And lower your voice.

860
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:13,139
Come with us.
Let's ask the store employees.

861
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,510
- Why should I?
- Will you just stop it?

862
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,679
I've had enough.

863
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,280
You have no right to accuse her.

864
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,380
Can't you try to get along?

865
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,789
Come on, Min Soo.

866
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,159
Where do you think you're going?

867
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,860
That's enough.
Stop.

868
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,559
That doll isn't hers.
I just know it.

869
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,730
You two are really scary.

870
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:38,070
- I'm so scared.
- Please don't fight.

871
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,630
Goodness.

872
00:56:40,269 --> 00:56:44,070
Call us if Seol or Bo Ra
bothers you again.

873
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:47,739
- I will, thanks.
- You looked pretty hot...

874
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,239
when you stood up to them.

875
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,150
I see you in a whole new light.

876
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,480
You're a hundred times better than Seol.

877
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,579
I agree.
We'll get going.

878
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,690
- Bye.
- Bye.

879
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,860
What was that for?

880
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,960
What's wrong with kissing you
when you belong to me?

881
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,760
- Stop.
- Okay. Let's go.

882
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,230
- You won't carry me?
- You're too heavy.

883
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,969
Yes, I can do this.

884
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:14,769
Yeong Gon's right.

885
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:17,909
I'm way better than Seol.

886
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,769
She couldn't say anything to me earlier.

887
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:49,670
- Excuse me.
- Oh no.

888
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,570
Did he notice me staring?

889
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,280
Are you a student here?

890
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,610
Yes.

891
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,880
Where's the Art Department?

892
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:00,679
- The Art Department?
- I'm here to meet a friend...

893
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,179
and I got lost.

894
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,250
I'll show you a map of the campus.

895
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:18,269
If you look at the map right here...

896
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,969
This is where we are now.

897
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,110
Go up this road.

898
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:28,280
Then turn left.
It's building number eight.

899
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,380
Oh, it's up this way.

900
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,050
Thank you.

901
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:56,670
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached.

902
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,679
I'm having dinner.
Sorry.

903
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:06,380
Right.
I'm sure he's busy.

904
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,280
I shouldn't disturb him.

905
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:26,599
Hello, dear niece.

906
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:29,670
- Uncle.
- You're home late.

907
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:33,780
Is it hard work being a student?
You look terrible.

908
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,409
Can you pour me a huge mug of coffee?

909
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,079
I have to study.

910
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:43,179
Caffeine isn't good for you.

911
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,659
Fine, but it's only because I love you.

912
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,159
A bit more.

913
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,000
Oh, In Ho's here.

914
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:02,900
He comes by to help me clean up
and plays the piano sometimes.

915
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:06,769
He practises the scales, like a kid.
He's a novice.

916
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,139
Really?

917
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,380
It must be hard to put up with.

918
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:12,980
A bit.

919
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:34,840
Hey.
When did you come in?

920
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:37,070
Make some noise when you do.

921
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:40,070
What's all the fuss about?

922
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,380
My uncle said you were here,
so I came to watch you practise.

923
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:46,179
Didn't you say you were good?

924
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,780
I played this
when I was in primary school.

925
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,849
It's your fault.
You're the reason I'm playing this.

926
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:57,159
Did you see the professor?

927
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,760
- Did he tell you to practise this?
- Yes.

928
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,630
Each scale is practised for a reason.

929
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:14,139
You wouldn't get it.
You know nothing about the piano.

930
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:20,050
And you think you do?
Yet, you're playing these scales?

931
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,280
What?

932
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,179
Why you...

933
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,190
You...

934
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:27,760
Go away.

935
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,760
Look at you.
You're nothing but all talk.

936
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,199
You can't even play the piano properly.

937
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,869
I can.
Watch.

938
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:07,360
Wow, you weren't kidding.
That was pretty good.

939
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,659
What were you saying about me?

940
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:14,639
It's just that I never actually
saw you play the piano before.

941
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,969
- I'll show you.
- Really?

942
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,710
I can't stand being mocked by you.

943
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,840
What do you want me to play?

944
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,480
Do you even know any tunes
other than the Czerny pieces?

945
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,179
I do know one.
It goes...

946
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,420
Like...

947
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,960
Was he like this in high school?

948
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,559
It sounds really nice.

949
01:03:27,539 --> 01:03:29,940
That's it.
I forgot the rest.

950
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,480
I forgot.

951
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:36,179
I think it went like this.

952
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,659
I'm good at playing this piece.

953
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:24,130
This is the only one you know, right?

954
01:04:25,869 --> 01:04:29,170
Even when small incidents ripple by,

955
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,440
they are mere ripples.

956
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,380
As always, we can and will pull through.

957
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,809
What else?

958
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,250
That jerk?
You better pray I never see you again.

959
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:22,119
I'll walk you to school.

960
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:23,659
For my peace of mind.

961
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,059
I need a place to stay.

962
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,130
Someone kicked me out of
the place I was staying at.

963
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:29,659
- Fine.
- Hong Seol.

964
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,170
She called me today.

965
01:05:31,269 --> 01:05:35,099
I'm trying harder than ever
not to lash out at you for this.

966
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:38,369
What happened to us?
We used to be so happy.

967
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:42,780
- Seol, I want to apologise.
- I don't know.

968
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,679
It's not just about the paper.

969
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,780
Was it really you
who sent the texts saying that...

970
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,380
- I liked Yeong Gon?
- Yes.

971
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,789
I want to get close, but I just can't.

972
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:57,659
I first grew to like you
because we were alike.

973
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,559
But we're completely different.

974
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:03,659
What kind of a person are you then?
