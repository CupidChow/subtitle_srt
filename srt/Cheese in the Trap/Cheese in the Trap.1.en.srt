00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,410
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:09,480
You should have been more careful.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,320
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,320
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,390
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,660
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,260
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,530
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,679
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,549
Gosh, she's sleeping deeply.

11
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,179
- Wake up, Seol! Seol.
- Wake up.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,320
Get up now. Open your eyes.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,719
- She's totally asleep.
- Hey!

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,890
- Goodness.
- Just leave me alone.

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,490
I'm tired.

16
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,000
- I'm tired. I'm exhausted.
- Here. Drink this.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,030
Because of you... Oh?

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,040
Gosh, seriously.
Drink this and wake up.

19
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,640
- Hey! No more alcohol for you.
- Stop her.

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,180
We're going to move to
a different place. Wake up now.

21
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm going to take time off
from school.

22
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll take time off from school too.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,719
- What are you talking about?
- I'll take time off from school...

24
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,390
- Goodness. She needs to go home.
- What's wrong with her?

25
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,890
She's acting really strange today.

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,030
- Gosh, Seol.
- We should take her home.

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,299
- We'll take you home, Seol.
- I won't go.

28
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,939
I won't! I'll take time off
from school.

29
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:39,939
- I'm really going to do it.
- "I'll take time off from school."

30
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,670
- I'll take time off from school...
- Why is she acting like this today?

31
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,379
Seol, stop it now.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,540
- Get up now. Let's go home.
- Let's go home.

33
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,180
- Get up, okay?
- Get up.

34
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,180
- Please?
- Get up now, Seol.

35
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,620
Get up. Get up now.

36
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,219
I got up! Where did he go?

37
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,920
Where is he?
Where did he disappear to?

38
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,260
- Where... Oh?
- Seol, Seol.

39
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,890
- Where did he go?
- Gosh, come on.

40
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,260
Oh!

41
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,669
- Seol!
- Is she okay?

42
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,669
- Gosh, that must hurt.
- Goodness. She must be in pain.

43
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,909
Oh? He's here.
I see him right here!

44
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:22,110
It's all because of you. Fine.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,650
I'll disappear from your life.

46
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:28,990
Will that make you happy?

47
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,699
(Episode 1)

48
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,469
I decided to take time off
from school because...

49
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,810
(One year ago,
at the beginning of semester party)

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,610
- Seol!
- Gosh, it's you!

51
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,310
- Hi.
- It's Hong Seol!

52
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,580
- Hi.
- Hong Seol.

53
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,520
Hi. Welcome back, Seol.

54
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,419
Doesn't it feel great to be back to
school after working for a year?

55
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,590
I'm just happy to see you again.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,460
Let me pour you a drink.

57
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,590
Is he Eun Taek?

58
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:10,900
Yes. You don't even need to
know his name.

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,060
He's just my servant.

60
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm jealous.
You have a servant now.

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,439
He can be your servant too.
Right, Eun Taek?

62
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:18,639
- My servant, cheers.
- Cheers!

63
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,569
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

64
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,939
The Napa cabbage leaf is ready.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,409
I'll add the meat as well as
ssamjang. I'll put in plenty of it.

66
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,210
Then I'll add garlic.

67
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,219
- Don't even lock eyes with him.
- Last but not least,

68
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,620
I'll pour soju as a finishing touch.

69
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,849
Ha Jae Woo.

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,560
I don't want to eat that.

71
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,590
Why not? It's not dirty.
Just try it.

72
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,030
Stop it! How many times do I have to
tell you that I don't want it?

73
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,229
- I don't want to eat it, okay?
- Why are they fighting?

74
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,300
Not everyone gets to taste
my soju ssam.

75
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,900
- Don't look at him.
- Hong Seol.

76
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,039
Seol.

77
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,169
Seol, we should celebrate
your return to school.

78
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,310
Let's liven up this party a bit.

79
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,379
- Just leave her alone.
- Come on. Get up now.

80
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:03,080
- Who would want to eat that?
- I can't drink...

81
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,180
- Get up and try it.
- Sang Cheol, it's not even fun.

82
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,250
- Stop it.
- It's for people who can't drink.

83
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,259
- Water is dripping. Eat it quickly.
- Seol, don't eat it.

84
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,189
- Don't eat it.
- All right. Go, Hong Seol!

85
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,930
Go, Hong Seol!

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,060
- Don't keep me waiting forever
- Sang Cheol. Stop it, seriously.

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,230
- Drink and drink away
- I really hate these things.

88
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,930
Drink up, drink up

89
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,470
Drink up, drink up
We're waiting

90
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,670
- Gosh, stop it!
- Goodness.

91
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,279
- Yes!
- She did it!

92
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,310
Seol, welcome back to school.

93
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,019
Hi, Jung. You made it.

94
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,550
- Jung! Come here.
- Are you okay?

95
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,220
- Come this way.
- Come and sit with us.

96
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,660
- Move. Get out.
- Goodness!

97
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,660
Look at this mess.
What should we do...

98
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,689
Attention, everyone. He recently
finished serving in the army...

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,329
and came back to school.
His name is Yu Jung.

100
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,000
- Let's welcome him with applause!
- You've heard a lot about him, no?

101
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,370
I haven't seen him in a while,
but he's still so good-looking.

102
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,610
But he looks a little cold.

103
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,310
What are you talking about?
He's perfection.

104
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,540
Don't you agree, Servant?

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,550
Well... Yes, sure.

106
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:10,920
But he's way too perfect
to be my type.

107
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,220
I'm attracted to men
who are not so perfect.

108
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,290
I'm not so perfect.
Let me feed you. Here.

109
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,129
Watch now. Da Young and Ju Yeon
will be all over him...

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,629
and try to win his heart.

111
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,560
Jung. I'll make
a lettuce wrap for you.

112
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,769
- Yes, thanks.
- Jung.

113
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,069
- Look. Look at Ju Yeon.
- Do you remember me?

114
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,310
Oh? Have you two met before?

115
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,810
Well, I met you once
as soon as I got into school, but...

116
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,509
- you joined the army after that.
- Is that right?

117
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,910
- Your name is...
- I'm Nam Ju Yeon.

118
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,579
- I'm happy to meet you again.
- Likewise.

119
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,149
The table is messy. Shall we get
these cleared up and order more?

120
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,019
- No, it's okay. I already ate.
- No, no. Let's order more dishes.

121
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,790
- It's really okay...
- Do you like cockles?

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,829
Pancakes? What do you like?

123
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,300
Jung doesn't eat those things.
You don't even know what to order.

124
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:02,199
I see it right there.
Seasoned skate.

125
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,139
Order something else.
That dish is expensive.

126
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,470
Shut it. Jung loves seasoned skate!

127
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,240
He's the one who wants to eat it.
He's just using Jung.

128
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,209
Jung, let me pour you a drink.

129
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,449
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- No, I'll pour you a drink.

130
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,350
- No, don't worry. I can do it.
- No, no. I want to do it.

131
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,120
- No, it's okay.
- No, let me do it...

132
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,490
- Goodness!
- Are you okay?

133
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,360
Give her some tissues.
Pass them to her.

134
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,220
- Are you okay?
- Jung, take these tissues.

135
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,930
- My socks are soaked.
- Go and dry your clothes.

136
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,089
It looks like she did it on purpose.

137
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,100
Wipe this here.

138
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,069
I see a smile on his face.

139
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,310
So she did it on purpose.

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,759
What was that about?

141
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:01,329
It's creeping me out.

142
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,839
Oh, hi. Seol, you were there.

143
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,970
Yes. What are you doing here?

144
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,439
I'm just counting the membership fee
we collected today.

145
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,610
Do they have to make me do this
when I'm much older than you?

146
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,620
Sang Cheol, let's go for
another round of drinks.

147
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,449
- We have enough money, right?
- Not at all. We've used it all up.

148
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,819
Everyone has to put in
extra 20 dollars.

149
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,589
What? What are you talking about?
No one would want to go then.

150
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,759
Jung is here.
What are you worried about?

151
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,560
- Today was his first day back.
- You know that his family is rich.

152
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,230
He's very generous too.

153
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,529
Seol. You'll come
with us too, right?

154
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,839
- No, I'll get going...
- Why not? We'll treat you!

155
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,000
Goodness.

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,009
Are you going to get the bill then?

157
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,379
Why should I get the bill?
We have Jung.

158
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,339
Goodness. Stop being a leech.

159
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,050
Listen. Jung hasn't seen us
in a long time. He'll treat us.

160
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,480
- That moment.
- He loves...

161
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,920
- I shouldn't have run into him.
- buying food and drinks for us.

162
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,389
That's how it all began.

163
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,230
Seol. Hong Seol!

164
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,529
It's you, isn't it? You're the one
who posted on the message board...

165
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,899
that I stole money
from the membership fee!

166
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,870
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about...

167
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:24,639
Look. Can you really say
that you didn't do this? Yes?

168
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,040
Goodness. You're such a great actor.

169
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,610
Look at you with your poker face.

170
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,519
Because of this, I had to go and
meet with the executive board,

171
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,990
and they interrogated me
about last year's fees too.

172
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,820
No, I didn't do it.

173
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,389
- Stop lying to my face.
- Do you even have evidence?

174
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,519
You should stay out of this.
You're the only one who saw me...

175
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,289
counting the money on the staircase
that day.

176
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,759
I wasn't the only one.
There was someone else.

177
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,970
Who? Tell me. Who else was there?

178
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,470
- That smirk.
- You were in the restroom too.

179
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,409
You're the only one.
It's you. You did it.

180
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,509
- You! It's you.
- Calm down first, okay?

181
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,840
- You stabbed me in the back. Gosh.
- Sang Cheol.

182
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,720
Regardless of who wrote that post,
it's not that person's fault.

183
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,850
- What?
- Let's talk about it later, okay?

184
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,820
Gosh, I'm so angry.
I won't forgive you, Seol.

185
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,759
Goodness, that stupid jerk.
He's really unbelievable.

186
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,230
Seol, I think
you did the right thing.

187
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,429
I'll talk to Sang Cheol about it.

188
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,370
Are you serious right now?

189
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,409
Do you really think that I did it?

190
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,279
You were there too.
Under the staircase.

191
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,980
- What are you trying to say?
- I know you saw everything.

192
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,120
I didn't do it.

193
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,519
So who would it be?

194
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,620
How dare you.

195
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,429
Are you accusing Jung of
writing that post about Sang Cheol?

196
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,429
Do you know what Jung had to
go through to resolve the situation?

197
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:56,129
He met each executive board member
who was threatening to sue.

198
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,970
- He even paid them back.
- That's enough.

199
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,399
Seol. So are you saying that...

200
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,879
Jung stabbed Sang Cheol in the back
then pretended to help him?

201
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,610
Are you writing a novel now?

202
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,980
You really didn't do it?

203
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,049
- I shouldn't have asked him.
- Jung, let's go.

204
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,919
Behind that smirk or smile of his,

205
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,789
he hides his scary side
and two-facedness,

206
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,330
which I didn't really know
back then.

207
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,700
Thank you.

208
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,429
Hello...

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,440
- I'd like two Americanos.
- Sure. They will be ready shortly.

210
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,669
Seol.

211
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,409
Have you apologised to Jung yet?

212
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,649
You didn't even say hi to him
properly earlier.

213
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,049
Jung isn't saying anything
because he's so forgiving.

214
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,649
If it were me,
I would have taught you a lesson.

215
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,960
- So what are you trying to tell me?
- Be thankful.

216
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,759
Hi, Seol.

217
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,029
What's wrong with him?

218
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,830
Yes, hello.

219
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,299
Jung, we'll be late for our class.
Let's go now.

220
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,570
Okay. Hold on.

221
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,110
Seol. I think you drink
too much coffee.

222
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,940
- Drink something healthier.
- Pardon me?

223
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,809
He totally ignored me earlier.

224
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,980
Why is he acting like this
all of a sudden?

225
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,049
I'll see you around.

226
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,289
It looks like you were dying to make
him notice you.

227
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,759
Are you happy now?

228
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:29,529
What?

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,429
Did he talk to me and act
all friendly on purpose?

230
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,740
Did he put on an act
for Nam Ju Yeon to see?

231
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,639
The class is about to start.
Where is she?

232
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,269
What are you doing this weekend?

233
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,340
Fallen head over heels for Jung,
Nam Ju Yeon...

234
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,509
started picking on me.

235
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,980
I'm going to work on it at home.

236
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,769
Hello...

237
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,200
What are you doing now?
Were you sleeping?

238
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,970
Are you going to skip the class?

239
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,600
It's only 10am now.

240
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,039
Seol, the class starts at 10am.
Wake up!

241
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,509
What are you going to do about
your attendance mark and the quiz?

242
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,009
Don't you know that you
won't be able to retake this quiz?

243
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,080
Ju Yeon said that the class
got rescheduled to 1pm.

244
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,120
What? Nam Ju Yeon
said that to you?

245
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,690
Listen. This will be a three-hour
class, so run here right now, okay?

246
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,590
Goodness. What is going on?

247
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,289
Look, Nam Ju Yeon.

248
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,789
Did you tell Seol that this class
got rescheduled to 1pm?

249
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:38,830
Right, I'm sorry.

250
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:40,759
I got confused and gave her
the wrong information.

251
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,840
How can she pick on Seol like this
as a student representative?

252
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,840
- I'm going to pull her hair out.
- Gosh, stop it. Calm down.

253
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,070
Leave it. It'd just make you
look crazy. Calm down now.

254
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,940
What should I do?

255
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,750
Seol won't be here for another
20 minutes even if she runs.

256
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,850
Gosh, why isn't
the professor here yet?

257
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,820
I should try calling.

258
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,120
Go and wait in front of the door.
Kidnap the professor for one hour.

259
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,620
Goodness. Stop talking nonsense.

260
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,860
I'll give you a kiss on your cheek.

261
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,370
What can I do...

262
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,970
- Gosh, what am I going to do...
- Do you think I'm a joke?

263
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,149
If she gets here in 20 minutes...

264
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,240
What's wrong with this door?

265
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,240
Why is Mr. Heo here?

266
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,409
The professor is at the emergency
room due to sudden stomach pain...

267
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,379
- and may not be able to come today.
- Yes!

268
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,950
Has she lost her mind?

269
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm going to check attendance now.
After that,

270
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:15,629
- there will be a quiz.
- You can't do that.

271
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,360
- No way.
- I'm authorised to do this.

272
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,230
The class is cancelled, so why
do you need to take attendance?

273
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,769
Plus, the professor isn't here,
so you can't give us a quiz.

274
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,370
I'm just doing what the professor
told me to do.

275
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,710
By the way, why are you trying to
order me around? Who are you?

276
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,539
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm sorry.

277
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,549
- Bo Ra. I'll be back.
- Kang Hyun Soo.

278
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,850
- Wait a little bit, okay?
- Where are you going?

279
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,350
Are you going to the washroom
in the middle of the class?

280
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,019
- Jang Young Joo.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

281
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,159
I walked here because
I had no money for bus fare.

282
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,629
- Come in and have a seat.
- Thank you.

283
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,759
Mr. Heo, I love you!

284
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,029
- Let go of this.
- What are you doing now?

285
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,470
- Bring it back here.
- I'm sorry.

286
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,639
This is mine now!

287
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:59,470
What are you talking about?
Give it back to me!

288
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,909
Stop and give it back to me, okay?

289
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,480
- Give it back!
- It's mine!

290
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,549
No, Seol. Not this way.

291
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,519
You, little mouse. Bring it back.

292
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,159
Goodness, this is ridiculous.

293
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,559
Give it back now!

294
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,600
Give it back.

295
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Mr. Heo.

296
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,409
- I love you.
- Goodness, this little mouse.

297
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,980
- Ouch! Ouch!
- You love me? You're crazy.

298
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,950
- You, idiot.
- Ouch, ouch.

299
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,919
- What? What do you want from me?
- That's enough.

300
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,120
- That's enough? What's enough?
- Ouch, it hurts.

301
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,419
Gosh. Mr. Heo, please forgive me.

302
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,190
- Then why did you take it?
- Please...

303
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,220
- Goodness, this mouse.
- I'm sorry.

304
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:56,559
I'm going to teach you
a lesson today.

305
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,460
- Seol!
- Yes!

306
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,029
Gosh, I'm so happy that
you made it in time.

307
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,009
Get this.
The professor isn't here today,

308
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,340
and Mr. Heo came instead.

309
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,279
Then Eun Taek ran away
with the attendance sheet.

310
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,009
Yes. I saw Eun Taek.

311
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,279
Really? Where did you see him?

312
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,580
Ouch, ouch, ouch. I'm really sorry.

313
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,350
- Go. Go in and sit down.
- I apologise again.

314
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,149
Just go and sit. Hurry up.

315
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,289
- I'm sorry.
- Why did he run away with this?

316
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,460
Look at you.
That was pretty impressive.

317
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,559
He usually never apologises
to me about anything.

318
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,330
Why in the world
did he run away with this?

319
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,799
You should behave yourselves even
when the professor isn't around.

320
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,129
All right. I'll check the attendance
again.

321
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,399
- Kang Seong Beom.
- Yes.

322
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,639
Goh Hyo Jin.

323
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,210
- After the incident at the party,
- Lee Ga Ram.

324
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:47,139
Jung started using other people
in a sly manner...

325
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,710
- to pick on me non-stop.
- Kim Jung Ryeol.

326
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,860
Goodness.

327
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,079
You should have been more careful.

328
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,549
That moment, I could really feel it.

329
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,750
I clearly felt his malicious
intent towards me.

330
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,490
My school life turned into hell
because of him,

331
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:38,059
and that's why I decided to
take time off from school.

332
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,440
You look so tired.
I'm glad to see you alive though.

333
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,039
You should have called in sick.

334
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,450
I have to get back to work now.

335
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,950
Do you remember talking about taking
time off from school while drunk?

336
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,549
- Yesterday?
- I knew you wouldn't remember it.

337
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,990
I'm crazy...

338
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,029
Here. Take this.
They say that sharing is caring.

339
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,730
Use it to pay your tuition fees.

340
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,970
You're crazy. You've been saving
for a year to go backpacking.

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,670
That's not true.
It's been 10 months, not a year.

342
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,410
- I can't take this.
- Just take it.

343
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,539
You shouldn't
take time off from school.

344
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:29,650
If you take a break now, do you know
how old you'll be when you graduate?

345
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,720
Age matters for women.

346
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,250
- I really can't take this.
- Just take it, okay?

347
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,349
I really want to go to
school together with you.

348
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,619
- Gosh, I do too!
- Then take this.

349
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,359
It's not because of money.

350
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,390
It must be because of money.

351
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:45,829
Who's calling now?

352
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,000
Hi, Eun Taek. What's up?

353
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:51,200
What?

354
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,910
What did you say?
Wow, that's so amazing.

355
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,839
Okay, thanks for letting me know.
I'll talk to you later.

356
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,349
What did Eun Taek say?

357
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,380
Why? Did something good
happen to him?

358
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,490
- Shall I tell you or not?
- Tell me!

359
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,650
You got a full scholarship.

360
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,420
- What?
- Hong Seol.

361
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,630
You're getting a full scholarship!

362
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,329
How is something like this possible?

363
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,640
With my part-time job, I need to
work for a year to earn this amount.

364
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,039
Is the universe telling me
not to take time off?

365
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,279
I really don't want to see him
at school though.

366
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,700
- Seol!
- Seol.

367
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,829
- Let's walk fast.
- Why?

368
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,240
Why? Why are we walking fast?

369
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,440
Run!

370
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,910
Seol, why are you running?
We have plenty of time!

371
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:06,210
- Why are we running right now?
- Look behind you.

372
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,650
- We need to reserve seats.
- Right, in the computer room. Run.

373
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,609
Gosh, let's go a little slower!

374
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,119
- We have to get there fast.
- Do you want to ruin the semester?

375
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,519
- Run!
- My friend, wait for me...

376
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,750
- Run faster!
- Run, Bo Ra. Look behind you.

377
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,160
- I'll meet you guys there.
- Come on, Bo Ra!

378
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,089
- I feel like I'll trip and fall!
- Wait for me! Wait for me.

379
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,369
Gosh, I'm so exhausted. I can't
even see what's on the monitor.

380
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,839
- Just turn on the computer first.
- Okay.

381
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,710
We have to get into Professor Han's
class. Put it as your first choice.

382
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:43,150
- It has to be the first choice.
- I know, of course.

383
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,380
We can't be bumped to
Professor Kang's class.

384
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,549
- Is your satellite clock on?
- Yes, I've turned it on.

385
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,990
It can't be off even by a second.

386
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,019
We have to click the button
at 9am sharp.

387
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,789
Our semester depends on the
index finger. Let's get ready now.

388
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,960
Okay.

389
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,240
Faster!

390
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,369
- Click now!
- Goodness.

391
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,640
- It's frozen.
- I think the website is down.

392
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,950
Don't do anything. Don't click
the refresh button, okay?

393
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,849
- Hey, you're going too fast.
- If you do, you'll ruin everything.

394
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,049
- Jae Woo, what's wrong with this?
- Don't talk to me right now.

395
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,150
- Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
- It's working. It's working now.

396
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,230
- It works now. Okay!
- Mine's still not working!

397
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,829
My computer shut down.

398
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,799
- Okay! Nice.
- Is yours still not working?

399
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,230
- Did you get into the class?
- Yes! I got in!

400
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:37,000
- Do it quickly!
- I got in. I did it.

401
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,799
- I'm not worried about the rest.
- Gosh.

402
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,140
I don't think I can get
into the next class.

403
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,539
- Try your plan B.
- I want to be in that class too.

404
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,869
Too late. Try your plan C.

405
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,009
Guys, it looks like I have
a difficult semester ahead.

406
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,880
I have three 9am classes.

407
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
- Gosh, this tastes so refreshing.
- Do you feel refreshed?

408
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,289
It looks like I should take
this semester off or something.

409
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,259
Don't be so upset. You got into
Professor Han's class at least.

410
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:00,990
Right, you should be happy about it.

411
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,789
That's the only good class.
Look at the rest.

412
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,230
It's honestly so depressing.

413
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,160
You're right. I would take
the semester off too if I were you.

414
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,140
What's this?
You have no 9am classes?

415
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,240
Look at hers.

416
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,740
That's not fair. Why do our
timetables look so different...

417
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,279
when we pressed the same buttons?

418
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:22,349
It's because your fingers are
so short like this,

419
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,849
- and... Ouch!
- Listen.

420
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,349
- Ouch, it hurts. There's Jung!
- Do you want to die? You're so...

421
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,150
It's Jung. Jung is here. Hello.

422
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,349
- Hi, Jung. You're early.
- Hello.

423
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,990
- Hi, Sang Cheol. You're here.
- Yes.

424
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,160
Hey, Seol! I heard that
you got a full scholarship.

425
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,230
You hit the jackpot.
Take all of us out for dinner.

426
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,170
You're right. She wouldn't have
gotten it if it weren't for Jung.

427
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,630
She should take him out for
barbecue 10 times.

428
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,000
- Totally.
- Ju Yeon, what do you mean by that?

429
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,440
You didn't know?
Mr. Heo lost Jung's paper.

430
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,339
That's why the scholarship
went to Seol.

431
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,309
Today is a perfect day
for all of us to go for barbecue.

432
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,250
Take us out.
We want to eat beef barbecue.

433
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,380
Sang Cheol.

434
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,289
- I'll treat you.
- I want Seol to treat me.

435
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,859
Let's go, Sang Cheol. It's my treat.

436
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,990
Good to see you, Seol.

437
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,430
Gosh, she got a full scholarship.

438
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,230
Goodness. What's going on?

439
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,369
I thought about taking time off
because of that jerk.

440
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
But according to them,

441
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,180
I basically ended up staying
at school because of him?

442
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,519
What's going on?

443
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,549
I feel like I'm being toyed around.

444
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,559
Goodness. I don't like this feeling.

445
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,230
Seol.

446
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,569
What are you doing now?

447
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:52,039
I was reading the course syllabus.
I'm done now.

448
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,509
It's good to see you again.

449
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,710
- Do you want to have lunch with me?
- Pardon me?

450
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,049
You haven't eaten lunch yet, right?

451
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,119
No, but I normally don't eat lunch.

452
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
(Personal Timetable)

453
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,009
What's wrong with him?
What was that about?

454
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,140
Did I do something wrong?

455
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,440
People may not know, but I do.

456
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:35,549
I didn't do anything wrong.

457
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,720
The scary side he's hiding
behind that fake smile of his.

458
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,450
Seol! Where are you going?

459
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,519
- Did Jung find you?
- How do you know?

460
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,420
- I told him.
- Bo Ra!

461
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,430
So he found you. What did he say?

462
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:52,400
- He asked me out for lunch.
- That's great.

463
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,769
He probably wants to take you out
for lunch to mend the relationship.

464
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,799
- He's so generous.
- Goodness.

465
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,170
You don't know him at all.

466
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,809
What do you mean?
Did you run away again?

467
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,140
You, fool. You always avoid Jung,
so he must be frustrated too.

468
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,009
You're probably the only person who
doesn't like him in our department.

469
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,549
Look at that witch, Nam Ju Yeon.

470
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,920
She's always hovering around him
and buttering him up,

471
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,049
- saying, "Jung, Jung."
- No, no.

472
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,450
Jung probably just wanted to
have lunch with Seol,

473
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,190
but she jumped to conclusions.

474
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,190
- "Does Jung like me? What if we..."
- Excuse me.

475
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,559
- Stop writing a novel.
- I'm sure that's what happened.

476
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,529
- You totally jumped to conclusions.
- Stop teasing her.

477
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,369
Let's just go and get lunch.
I'm hungry.

478
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,869
- Okay, let's go and eat.
- You should have gone with Jung.

479
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,950
Sang Cheol!
Please take us out for lunch.

480
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,220
- Okay. Okay.
- Take us out for lunch.

481
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,559
- Please buy us lunch.
- All right. I'll buy you lunch.

482
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,960
- He's the rich one. Ask him.
- Really?

483
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,759
- Jae Woo! Please buy us lunch.
- Take us out for lunch, please.

484
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,900
- Sang Cheol!
- Whatever.

485
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,599
I'm so happy that I could
at least get into this class.

486
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,839
Look how crowded it is.
It's packed.

487
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,809
Half of these people must be here
to beg their way into the class.

488
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,750
I told you. Aren't you happy
that you listened to me and ran?

489
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,519
Seol, you're the best.

490
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

491
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,390
Gosh, there are so many of you.
Some are even sitting on the stairs.

492
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:31,430
It looks like we need
a bigger classroom.

493
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,400
I guess some of you here
couldn't enrol in the course.

494
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,970
Can those people raise their hands?

495
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,069
I see. I'd love to have you
in my class,

496
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,640
but we cannot exceed
the course capacity.

497
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,950
I'll call the roll, and those of you
whose names are not called...

498
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,009
should leave the room
before the class starts.

499
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,150
Well, I heard that
Professor Kang's class is great.

500
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:58,420
No, trust me. It'll be very
organised, and you'll learn a lot.

501
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,390
He's much more competent than I am,
so you should take his class.

502
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,160
And please don't visit my lab
to ask me for favours.

503
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,529
Especially you, pretty ladies.

504
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,529
Remember that I won't give
special treatments to anyone.

505
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,240
All right. I'll call the roll now.

506
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,569
- Nam Ju Yeon.
- Yes.

507
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,049
- Jang Bo Ra.
- Here!

508
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,150
- Yu Jung.
- Yes.

509
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,150
- Choi Ji Yeon.
- Yes.

510
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,779
- Ha Mi Jin.
- Yes.

511
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,349
- Heo Kyung Joo.
- Here!

512
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:32,190
Okay. It looks like
everyone is here.

513
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,420
- I'll begin the lecture now.
- Why didn't he call your name?

514
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,160
Ask him. You don't want to be
marked as absent.

515
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,630
Professor Han!

516
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,970
My name hasn't been called.

517
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,099
What's your name?

518
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,039
I'm Hong Seol in the third year.

519
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,509
I don't see you on this list.
Are you enrolled in the class?

520
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,710
- We got enrolled at the same time.
- That's right.

521
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,009
Is that so?
Then stay for today's lecture,

522
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,079
and let's look into it later.

523
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,779
- All right.
- What's going on?

524
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,849
- I'll begin the lecture now.
- You double-checked, right?

525
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,460
- I even printed the timetable.
- I know.

526
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,390
- This is your name, right?
- Yes.

527
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,230
Come here.

528
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,630
You see this, right?
"Registration cancelled".

529
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,170
- It says right here.
- Well...

530
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,539
- That's impossible.
- Gosh, go away now.

531
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,210
There must have been an error...

532
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,009
I'm busy.
I have to answer this call.

533
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,440
- I'm sorry, but could you check...
- Go away.

534
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,640
Hello?

535
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,779
Yes. The registration is now closed,
so there's nothing we can do.

536
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,519
- I'll have a quick look.
- Goodness.

537
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,589
Just call the professor
directly then.

538
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,559
What? Did you just say, "Darn it"?

539
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,990
Hey. What's your name?

540
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,829
No, no. You should come here.

541
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,400
Don't even call
if you're not going to show up!

542
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,170
Never mind.
Thank you for your help.

543
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,200
How is this even possible?

544
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,640
Someone stole
your ID and password...

545
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,069
and cancelled
your enrolment right away.

546
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,539
How did this person find out
her password though?

547
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:03,049
Someone could have been watching
her when she was logging in.

548
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,349
It looks like that person
took your spot in the class.

549
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,720
- What time did you say it happened?
- Right, tell us again.

550
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,849
- It was 11...
- Look at you, Ha Jae Woo!

551
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,359
- Did you buy a new laptop?
- It's none of your business.

552
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,990
Anyway, we need to find out
who did this...

553
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,930
and tell everyone about it.

554
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,430
This person needs to pay for
what he or she has done.

555
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Listen. I'm in Professor Kang's
class, but I'm bothered by this.

556
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,369
Why are you being suspicious of
everyone because of her?

557
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,970
This happened, and
we need to find out who did it.

558
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,980
Goodness.
You really get on my nerves.

559
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:36,250
Just go and mind your own business.

560
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,779
You can just enrol
in a different class.

561
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,650
I don't understand why you're
making a big fuss about it.

562
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,450
I get that you're obsessed with
your grades,

563
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,119
but you shouldn't be suspicious
of innocent people.

564
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,720
This is leaving
a bad taste in my mouth.

565
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:47,789
Look, Nam Ju Yeon.

566
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,559
Didn't you come to school so early
to enrol in Professor Han's...

567
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,430
class because you're
obsessed with grades?

568
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
It sounds like you think
someone cancelled your...

569
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,799
course registration on purpose.

570
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,339
Don't be suspicious of people
when you don't even have evidence.

571
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,569
You did this last year too.
It looks like you enjoy it.

572
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,609
Hey! Watch what you say!

573
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,880
She's so mean! I can't stand her.

574
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,009
Gosh, I'm so infuriated.

575
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,250
Goodness. Just leave me alone.

576
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,950
I must catch this person. He or she
will need to take responsibility.

577
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,420
Yes. I want to be cool about it
and just laugh it off too.

578
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,160
But...

579
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,500
if I take Professor Kang's class,
it'll be hard to get a scholarship.

580
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,000
Then I'll need to
take next semester off.

581
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,400
Sigh, what a mess.

582
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,440
But the registration was
cancelled...

583
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,380
around 12pm.

584
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,180
I was at the library then.

585
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,380
Seol. Seol.

586
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,750
(11:41am)

587
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,089
Hi... Jung.

588
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,960
Are you in this class too?

589
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,529
Yes.

590
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,559
What brings you here?

591
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,430
Well, I figured that this class
would be less crowded.

592
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,430
You probably thought
the same thing, didn't you?

593
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,069
I guess I probably did.

594
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,140
I did.

595
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:12,779
You're funny.

596
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,349
It's not funny at all.

597
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,220
Darn it. How did I end up
in the same class as him...

598
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,630
Is this a coincidence?

599
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,599
Someone could have been watching
her when she was logging in.

600
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,569
What if...

601
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,769
Right. He's definitely
capable of doing it.

602
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,049
You're done for the day, right?

603
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,990
- Do you want to go for dinner?
- No.

604
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:01,220
Why not? Do I make you
feel uncomfortable?

605
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,890
No, that's not why... Well...

606
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm going to go see
Professor Han and beg him.

607
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,630
You said that your course
registration got cancelled, right?

608
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,170
I think someone did it on purpose.

609
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,809
Does anyone come to your mind?

610
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,150
I'm not sure. But I'll be sure
to find out who did it.

611
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,420
I'll see you later.

612
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,029
There are 80 students in total.
I can't really run every single...

613
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:46,039
student number through
the system for this, can I?

614
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,140
Well, I can do it.
It's doable, but...

615
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,240
it'll just show that
her registration was cancelled.

616
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,380
Is there anything else we can do?

617
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,809
We could ask
the security team for help,

618
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,849
but they'll only be able to find out
the IP address.

619
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,779
They won't be able to find out
who did it.

620
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,650
I have a favour to ask you.

621
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,559
I understand the situation,

622
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,730
but unfortunately,
there's nothing I can do.

623
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,859
I heard that professors have...

624
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,599
the authority to accept
a few additional students.

625
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,269
Please help me.
I really want to take your course.

626
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,140
Gosh. This is why I said pretty
girls like you shouldn't come here.

627
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,750
Goodness. You shouldn't
talk like that to your students.

628
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,009
- Hello.
- Yes, hi.

629
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,880
- There're still spots in my class.
- Right.

630
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:38,450
Why? My course is also
a prerequisite for your major.

631
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,819
You should enrol
in my class instead.

632
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,789
What's wrong?
You don't want to take my class?

633
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,430
Well, that's not what it is.

634
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,759
Then what is it?

635
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,240
I see. You're scared because
everyone calls me Witch, right?

636
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,670
Witch Kang.
That's my nickname, isn't it?

637
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,309
I heard that all students
call me Witch Kang.

638
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,369
I just find it hilarious.

639
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,880
You guys don't know me well.
I'm actually very nice and sweet.

640
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:05,650
Why are you laughing?

641
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,150
Sorry, it's nothing.

642
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,750
I don't think I can squeeze you
into my class.

643
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,889
You should enrol in
Professor Kang's class instead.

644
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,789
You'll find out that she's a nice
person once you get to know her.

645
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,929
You'll learn a lot from her
as well as from her class.

646
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,429
You'll be good
to this student, right?

647
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,400
Of course. Don't even worry.

648
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,539
I always treat all of my students
very well.

649
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,039
What's your name?

650
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,340
My name is Hong Seol.

651
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,650
Hong Seol? Gosh, what a pretty name.

652
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,679
Nice to meet you.

653
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,150
Likewise.

654
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,550
I got this for you.

655
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,690
If I take the 10am and 11am classes
on Tuesdays, I can't take this...

656
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,730
Gosh, what a mess.

657
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,559
What a way to start the semester
off on the wrong foot.

658
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,500
Yu Jung, this jerk. I'm so angry.

659
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,239
Hello, welcome...

660
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,849
How did he find out
that I work here?

661
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,679
What can I get for you?

662
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:19,559
I'd like an Americano and
a strawberry milkshake.

663
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,460
Your total comes to eight dollars.

664
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,239
Please sign at the bottom.

665
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,909
- Do you need a receipt?
- No.

666
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,449
Here they are.

667
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,559
That's yours.

668
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,360
What's this about now?

669
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,139
Hello?

670
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,639
Hi, Su Kyung.
Why aren't you here yet?

671
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,650
- Lim Kyung Hwan.
- Yes.

672
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,349
- Kim Sang Cheol.
- Here.

673
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,590
It's you. You failed last time.
Be sure to pass this one, all right?

674
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:23,849
- Son Min Soo?
- Yes.

675
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:26,920
Hong Seol.

676
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,059
Hong Seol?

677
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,099
You must be curious about
how you'll be graded.

678
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,340
Attendance will take up
20 percent.

679
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:41,269
The midterm and the final exam
will together be 50 percent.

680
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,840
Group assignments
will take up 20 percent,

681
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,369
and individual assignments
will be 10 percent.

682
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,980
Plus, there'll be
two group presentations,

683
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,880
the first one at midterm and
the second one at the end.

684
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,349
What's wrong?

685
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,750
It's not like you didn't know
how it was going to be.

686
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,449
I'm sure you've all
heard about my classes.

687
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:59,619
You all want to take
an easy class, don't you?

688
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:01,889
Then go and take another class.

689
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,260
Everyone, wake up now.

690
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,329
I'm sure all of you want to
be successful in life.

691
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,730
Do you want to ruin your life
in this tough economy?

692
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,170
No, right?

693
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,369
Who is it?

694
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:19,079
- I'm sorry.
- Come in quickly.

695
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,309
You're late.

696
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,150
Listen carefully. Being late 3 times
will count as 1 absence.

697
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,389
If you miss three classes,
you'll automatically fail.

698
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,519
Even during the correction period,

699
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:34,119
I'll check your attendance
and punctuality, okay?

700
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,929
- Okay.
- Understood.

701
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,460
Hong Seol?

702
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,260
Yes.

703
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,199
You were late today.

704
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,099
Hong Seol?

705
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,639
Yes. Show me your textbook.

706
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,769
It looks like you came empty-handed.
Aren't I right?

707
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,880
Everyone, open your textbook.

708
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:00,679
Look at this. Look at you all.

709
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:02,150
Listen.

710
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,590
Have you not heard about
my classes?

711
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,289
My lecture always begins
on the very first day of class.

712
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,030
The textbook is very important
in my lecture.

713
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:14,030
If you don't bring your
textbook to the next class,

714
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,869
you'll end up having to retake
the course like Sang Cheol.

715
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,139
All right. Open the book.

716
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:22,869
Let's start now.

717
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,510
Can I share your textbook?

718
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,150
Witch Kang hates me now.

719
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,159
Gosh, it's because
I saw that jerk this morning.

720
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,599
Excuse me... Seol.

721
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:55,739
Do I know you?

722
00:38:55,809 --> 00:38:59,110
I'm Min Soo, Son Min Soo.

723
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,650
I have something to tell you.

724
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,349
Just in case. I wanted to tell you
just in case.

725
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,920
I saw who it was.

726
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,489
On the day we were
registering for our courses,

727
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,829
I saw the person who used
the computer here right after you.

728
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,599
Who was it?

729
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,269
Seol.

730
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,610
What are you doing now?

731
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,110
I was...
I was reading the course syllabus.

732
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,309
I'm done now.

733
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:01,900
So it's Jung again?

734
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:05,110
Are you serious?
Can you really trust her though?

735
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,809
Don't you remember
what you went through last year?

736
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:08,139
The post about Sang Cheol.

737
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,949
You thought Jung wrote it
and got into trouble for it.

738
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,679
In my opinion, you have to be
very careful about this.

739
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,690
If it's not true, you'll get into
even bigger trouble.

740
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,260
Do you like Jung that much?

741
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,019
Is that why you want to see him
in the CCTV footage?

742
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,320
Shut it, seriously.

743
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm just going to go alone
to check the footage.

744
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,059
- Gosh, don't be mad at us.
- Go alone then. Just go.

745
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,079
Do you really think I did it?

746
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,750
You're not answering, so I guess
you're suspicious of me.

747
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,849
If you didn't do it,

748
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,050
tell me that it is the case.

749
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:55,760
Sure. I'll see you in front of
the library at 6pm.

750
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,630
Let's check
the CCTV footage together.

751
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,329
Right, take this.

752
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,300
I didn't think that you guys would
be here. I just got one for Seol.

753
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,369
- Don't worry. It's okay.
- We're okay.

754
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,489
Listen, Seol. I don't think it's
him. What are you going to do?

755
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,590
- You're in trouble.
- Are you happy now?

756
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,730
You're happy, aren't you?

757
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,130
Shut it and drink this.

758
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,500
Gosh, it's so cold.

759
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,539
Guys, will the lecture be any good?

760
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,139
What are you talking about?
We have to check out his lecture.

761
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,210
- He must make tons of money, no?
- Is that right?

762
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,579
Hello?

763
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,250
Hi, Ju Yeon.

764
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,349
I don't think I can come with you
to the lecture today.

765
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,019
Why not? Everyone is
waiting for you now.

766
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,719
I have to meet Seol.

767
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,030
I promised her that I'd check
the CCTV footage with her.

768
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:06,860
I think I can help her find who
cancelled her course registration.

769
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:10,170
But why do you have to
check the footage with her?

770
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:11,900
Are you really not going to
come to the lecture?

771
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,300
I'm meeting her at 6pm, so I'll see
if I can make it afterwards.

772
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,869
I'll talk to you later.

773
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,809
Seol and CCTV footage?
What's going on?

774
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:22,309
I don't think I can go for
barbecue with you guys today.

775
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,449
Shut it. I cancelled my dinner plan
because of you. Let's go now.

776
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,019
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

777
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,659
- Hello.
- Hi.

778
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,960
You must be tired.

779
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,099
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached. Please leave...

780
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,829
It's past 6pm, and Jung
isn't answering his phone.

781
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,940
That's strange. Is he really guilty
of something like you said?

782
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:51,840
Let's not wait for him.
Let's just go.

783
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,340
Will they show us
the CCTV footage though?

784
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,309
I'm worried that
they won't show it to us.

785
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,619
I have a good idea. Let's go.

786
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,079
You're not going to
use me again, are you?

787
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,449
Let's just go in first.

788
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:04,050
What's your idea?

789
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,619
My dad burned everything else.

790
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,260
That photo is the only thing
I have left.

791
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:16,469
That photo helped me get through
even the toughest times.

792
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:21,599
Sir, I really have to
find my wallet.

793
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,710
Without it, I'll have nothing to
look at when I miss my mum.

794
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,849
Goodness, what a headache.

795
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:33,119
Sir, I beg you. Please?

796
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,650
Be quick, okay?

797
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,719
I'm going to go do my rounds.

798
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,920
- Sure. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

799
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,860
Seol, what was the date again?

800
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,130
February 16th.

801
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,130
It was 11:52am.

802
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:53,500
It's here.

803
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,269
Where were you sitting?

804
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,539
I was sitting at the end of here...

805
00:43:57,139 --> 00:43:59,639
What? You were in
one of the CCTV blind spots.

806
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:02,340
Goodness.
Why did you have to sit there?

807
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,349
Then we can check who came in
and left, right?

808
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,449
I'll go back to 11:40am.

809
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,650
Let's see who walks in...

810
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,719
Here! I see Jung.

811
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,559
He's quietly watching you...

812
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,699
then he's walking up to you now.
He's approaching you.

813
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,500
Then was this when he asked you,
"Do you want to eat with me?"

814
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,329
"No, I've already eaten."

815
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:27,340
- "How about we go for coffee then?"
- "I already drank coffee too."

816
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,800
Did you try to get out of
the conversation like this?

817
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,139
Yes, it's close.

818
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,909
You are talking to him now and...

819
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,210
Yes, you're running
out of there now.

820
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,179
Did you log off before you leave?

821
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,449
You didn't?

822
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,550
- I don't think I did.
- But Jung is staying there.

823
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,719
You're right. He's still there.

824
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,429
- Gosh, what if...
- No way!

825
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,030
He wouldn't have actually
cancelled your registration, right?

826
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,260
Let's keep watching.

827
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,730
Look. He's leaving now.

828
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,030
Hang on, what time...
It says 11:45am.

829
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:01,900
He left at 11:45am. Seol!
Then he's not the one!

830
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,070
You said that the registration
was cancelled at 11:53am.

831
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,940
Gosh, why are you so paranoid
with Jung?

832
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,210
What's wrong with you?

833
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,250
- How will you face him now?
- Get out now if you're done.

834
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,320
Sir, I think I need to watch
a bit more to find it.

835
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,050
Gosh, you really can't be
doing this here.

836
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,849
- Sir, please...
- Please leave now. Get out,

837
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,190
- okay?
- Please, Sir...

838
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,690
- Get out now.
- Please...

839
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,530
I just need to watch
a little bit more...

840
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,530
What a nuisance.

841
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,670
Why did you do it?

842
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,099
What did I do?

843
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,340
If you didn't do it, why did you
show up there at that hour?

844
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,650
Jung.

845
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,960
What about you then?
Why were you there?

846
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,300
I was curious to find out
who did such a thing to Seol.

847
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,840
I found the IP address
through Mr. Heo, and...

848
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,840
it turned out to belong to the
computer Seol used at the library.

849
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,110
So I looked through
the CCTV footage.

850
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:22,349
Jung. I made a mistake.

851
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:24,750
Help me. Please let it go this once.

852
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,920
If you can pretend to know nothing,

853
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,489
there won't be any problem, right?

854
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,329
You know I wouldn't have intended
on doing such a thing, right?

855
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,099
I was just going to use the computer
and saw that it wasn't logged off.

856
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:42,139
Then I realised that the timetable
was Seol's.

857
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,510
Gosh. I was going to just log off
from the session, but...

858
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,579
Jung, you already know. You know
that I have to retake the course.

859
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,949
If I take Professor Kang's class
and fail again,

860
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,949
I won't be able to graduate
or get a job.

861
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,289
I hope you can understand.

862
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,289
I was so desperate.
Do you understand?

863
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,889
You should have said these things
to Seol.

864
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,730
It's not like
I got anything out of it.

865
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:11,400
I logged in after cancelling
her registration for that class,

866
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,000
but another jerk had already stolen
that spot within those few seconds.

867
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:17,139
I went through all that
for someone else.

868
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:21,809
Jung. I'm really sorry, okay?

869
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,610
If people find out about this,

870
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:27,619
I'll be too humiliated to
even come to school.

871
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,690
Goodness. I'll do everything
you want me to do.

872
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,519
I'll do as you say.
That'd be good, right?

873
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,460
But...

874
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:43,130
it looks like the CCTV cameras
need to be relocated.

875
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:44,829
What?

876
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,869
That computer station happens
to be one of the CCTV blind spots.

877
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,110
The footage shows you entering
and leaving the library space,

878
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:53,079
but I couldn't see what you were
actually doing there.

879
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,750
Did you just trick me then?

880
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:01,980
I of course didn't mean to.

881
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,320
I had no idea.

882
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,289
I didn't know that...

883
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,260
you'd tell me everything like this.

884
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,269
Jung, you...

885
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,250
Who do you think it was?

886
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:34,750
I have no clue.
This is very frustrating.

887
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,949
I'll go home now.

888
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,219
Really? Are you not eating
dinner with us then?

889
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,659
I'm sad. Come and eat with us.

890
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,730
- Get home safely, Seol.
- Bye.

891
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,900
If it's not Jung, who would it be?

892
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,909
Did Jung really not do it?

893
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,130
So who did it? Did you find out?

894
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,059
Why didn't you come?

895
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,570
Do you still think that I did it?

896
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,670
Why didn't you tell me that
you didn't do it?

897
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,969
If I told you, would you have
believed me?

898
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,579
No. I wouldn't have believed him.

899
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:39,480
Why did he give up the scholarship?

900
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,550
Why is he in the elective course
that I'm in?

901
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,150
I have many questions for him,

902
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:46,659
but I'm not confident...

903
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:50,559
that I can fully trust
his answers yet.

904
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,329
I apologise.

905
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:55,699
It looks like I was
mistaken this time.

906
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,730
Is that it?

907
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,269
Pardon me?

908
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,869
Do you want to go for
dinner with me?

909
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:05,010
No.

910
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,610
I don't eat dinner.

911
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:12,750
I'm sorry again.

912
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,670
Just like that,

913
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:36,340
the correction period for
course registration ended.

914
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,239
I wasn't able to find out
who cancelled my registration,

915
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,940
but I guess there was someone...

916
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,480
who was more desperate
to be in that class than me.

917
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:47,820
I decided to look at it this way.

918
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,130
I'll put in canned tuna first.

919
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,329
Then I should put in gochujang.

920
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,050
Yes, hello?

921
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,679
Hi, Mum.

922
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,150
Gosh, I'm not a kid.
You don't need to worry.

923
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:25,090
I always make sure
to eat well, of course.

924
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,989
Now? I'm eating hoedeopbap.
I made it with tuna.

925
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:34,130
Gosh, this cut of tuna is
the most expensive sashimi.

926
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,559
Yes.

927
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,829
Right. I got a few offers,

928
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,670
and I'm trying to make a decision.
Yes.

929
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:45,739
I want to get into one of those big
global corporations. Yes, exactly.

930
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,309
Yes. Don't worry too much, Mum.

931
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,110
Right, Mum. Send me some kimchi.
I'm craving your kimchi.

932
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:56,349
Yes. Thanks, Mum.

933
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,650
Bye.

934
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,670
Wait, In Ha.

935
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:22,909
In Ha. Hold on.

936
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,150
Thanks for everything. Take care
and stay healthy. Bye.

937
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,250
Wait, In Ha. Baek In Ha!

938
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,320
What are you doing now?
I've done everything for you.

939
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:33,019
Are you a gold digger?

940
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,889
Have you lost your mind?

941
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,460
I hung out with you and did you
proud while acting all cute for you.

942
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,099
I've done more than enough.

943
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,329
- Don't you know give-and-take?
- You're unbelievable...

944
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,469
You know what? Forget it.
You don't think guys care about...

945
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,340
what women do for work and how
much money they have?

946
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,340
You're 26 years old,

947
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:53,110
and all you can do is suck money
out of men like a leech.

948
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:56,039
- You, jerk. Watch your tongue!
- You have such a foul mouth.

949
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,550
You're polluting my ears.

950
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,949
- Who are you?
- Stop chasing her around.

951
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,750
You're so pathetic.

952
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,550
Who is this scum?

953
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,719
You're really unbelievable.

954
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,690
Stop living your life like
a piece of trash.

955
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,030
How dare you, jerk.

956
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,829
I'll teach you a lesson today.

957
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,969
- Open the door, you jerk.
- This is for you, witch.

958
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,099
- How dare you! Stop, you jerk!
- That jerk is crazy! Goodness.

959
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,900
- Stop! I'll teach you a lesson.
- I'm going to hurt you badly!

960
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,469
- Get lost!
- I'll break your fingers, you scum!

961
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,639
Your fiery temper hasn't changed,
Baek In Ho.

962
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,750
You're still the same too,
except that you've aged.

963
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:35,019
You're also still... Well, you're
actually looking really crummy.

964
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:43,329
Goodness, it stinks in here.

965
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,289
You smoke inside your place,
don't you?

966
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,030
By the way, why are you living here?

967
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:52,530
Did you get kicked out?

968
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:55,139
What are you talking about?

969
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:59,039
The president got this place for me
so that I can live independently.

970
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,739
You're making it obvious that you're
still financially dependent. Idiot.

971
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:03,349
Whatever. Who cares?

972
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,449
By the way, how did you find out
my address?

973
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,719
I went to your school and found out
by telling them I'm your brother.

974
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,219
I heard you quit school.

975
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,090
School is such a waste of time.
I'm not going to get a job anyway.

976
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,860
So you quit school and decided to
suck money out of guys?

977
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,329
- Shut it.
- You're pathetic.

978
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,530
Didn't you run away?
Why do you pretend to care now?

979
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:24,469
Whether I quit school or suck money
out of guys, why do you care?

980
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,369
- I just think you're so pathetic.
- You're way more pathetic.

981
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,510
Why did you show up? Did you have
enough fun in the last five years?

982
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,969
Right, look at you.
From head to toe, I can just...

983
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:35,940
look at your clothes and
figure out how you've been living.

984
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,980
- Watch your tongue.
- Right! I know why you're here.

985
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:39,949
Do you need money
from the president?

986
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,750
Starting with medical expenses,
you've come up with many excuses.

987
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,650
- Good for you. You have tons of...
- Baek In Ha!

988
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,460
Shut your mouth. You're
old enough to know that...

989
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:49,960
- you shouldn't...
- Smarten up already.

990
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,230
Pride does not pay your bills, okay?

991
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,000
You've hit the bottom, so you
should have learned your lesson.

992
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:01,500
Right. I was crazy to think to
check in on you as your brother.

993
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,610
Why in the world did I end up with
an elder sister like you?

994
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:08,139
Did you meet Jung?

995
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,110
He's changed a lot too.

996
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,150
It's been a long while, so I'm sure
he's been feeling uncomfortable too.

997
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,519
What do you think?
Shall I call him for you?

998
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,329
What a joke.

999
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,340
(Baek In Ha)

1000
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:41,809
Jung!

1001
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,150
In Ho is back. Yes! You're
surprised to hear this, right?

1002
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,150
Yes. The three of us should
get together. It's been too long.

1003
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,619
Right. It's exam time now.

1004
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,760
I see. It'll be difficult for you
to make time then, won't it?

1005
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:01,500
Okay. I'll tell In Ho.

1006
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:08,269
He's saying he has exams, but it
sounds like he misses you a lot.

1007
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,739
- You should go meet Jung.
- Forget it.

1008
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,510
- You just love talking nonsense.
- You don't have to believe me,

1009
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,909
but wouldn't you feel better
after seeing him?

1010
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,679
He goes to Yonyi University. His
major is business administration.

1011
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,119
Where are you going now?

1012
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,719
Why is this jerk
not answering my call?

1013
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:33,829
Jung! In Ho is back.

1014
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,530
Why are you not answering
your phone?

1015
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,769
The three of us should get together.
Just like the old days. You know?

1016
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,869
(Delete)

1017
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,650
- All right. Cha Min Young?
- Yes.

1018
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,250
- Okay. Ha Jae Woo.
- Yes.

1019
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:54,320
- Hong Seol.
- Here!

1020
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:56,820
This already happened,
so I'll just do my best.

1021
00:56:56,849 --> 00:56:59,320
- I'm sure I'll learn something.
- Management...

1022
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,260
I should be happy that
I don't have to see him here.

1023
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,590
Jung, what brings you here?

1024
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:10,130
I'm sorry.

1025
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
What?

1026
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,369
Hold on, are you in this class...
Your name isn't here though.

1027
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:20,610
I switched. I thought your class
would be more fun.

1028
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,050
Is that right?
I'm happy to see you here.

1029
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:27,150
Smart students love my classes.

1030
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,150
All right. Shall we begin now?

1031
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,219
- Conflict management.
- Seol.

1032
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,119
Let's look at page 12.

1033
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,489
Hi, Seol.

1034
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,929
What does he want from me?

1035
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:10,090
I was already weirded out by him,

1036
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:13,030
but he started doing even
more suspicious things.

1037
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,260
Why? Are you bothered by me?

1038
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,699
I'm really bothered by you too.

1039
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,269
- Are you close friends with him?
- No, I'm not. Not at all.

1040
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,469
Seol. Seol. Seol.

1041
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,099
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go and get food.

1042
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,610
Why is he so obsessed with
eating with me?

1043
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,340
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

1044
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,809
He's sly like a snake,

1045
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:34,449
and I really can't figure out
what he's thinking.

1046
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,889
Don't be too excited thinking that
Jung is interested in you.

1047
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,019
He's friendly and sweet
towards everyone.

1048
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,090
I've never given you
any special treatments.

1049
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,320
You're such a joke.

1050
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,030
You're so pathetic.
You're still drenched in guilt.

1051
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,599
You don't seem to feel guilty at all
about ruining someone's life.

1052
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,130
Guilt? Why should I feel guilty?

1053
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:52,070
You. Come here.

1054
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:55,269
I like you. You're the only person
who treats him like that.

1055
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,469
Me?

1056
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,210
That's nothing.

1057
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,340
Seol is in danger now.

1058
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,139
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

1059
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,150
This feels somewhat different
from how it's been.

1060
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,019
Does he really mean it?

1061
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:09,650
Gosh, I don't even know any more.
