00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:05,580
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,119
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,119
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,859
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,059
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,300
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,769
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:40,009
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,450
Why isn't Joon picking up?

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,750
I'm from the moving company.

12
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,320
- Who?
- The moving company.

13
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,729
Did Joon call them?

14
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,340
- Hi.
- It's you?

15
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,170
You're done already?

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,239
Why didn't you call us?

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,909
Say hi.

18
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,540
We brought him over.

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,950
- Jung.
- This is what boyfriends are for.

20
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,750
Have you been here before?

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,450
I think he has.

22
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,849
He has not.

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,790
You just have to
stack the boxes now.

24
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,530
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yes, let's do that.

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,299
- Let's go for some meat.
- Yes.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,629
It's been a while since
the four of us got together.

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,629
- I want meat.
- Sure, let me get ready.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,140
- Just go dressed like that.
- Wait.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,340
Okay, okay.

30
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's go eat.

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,650
(Episode 7)

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,650
I hate that the most.

33
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,819
That's the first time
I lived alone in that room.

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,420
I'm somewhat sad to leave the place.

35
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,530
I'm moving further away
from you and Bo Ra.

36
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,430
- I guess.
- Seol.

37
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:06,629
Mad Hair.

38
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,800
You said you'd come this morning.
What took you so long?

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,740
Why are you with him?

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,210
I met him on the way here.

41
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,340
Did you drink in broad daylight?

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,509
Get your act together!

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,909
Relax.

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,550
Who are they?

45
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,789
He's my brother and he...

46
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,460
He's...

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,159
I used to teach at
her language institute.

48
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,659
I'm Baek In Ho.

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,830
Hello, I'm Seol's friend.

50
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,560
What are you doing?

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,099
Go and finish packing up.

52
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,840
- No way.
- "No way"?

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,439
Go and finish up.

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,039
Why should I pack your stuff?

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,069
You said you would, didn't you?

56
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,439
Seol. Let's just go all together.

57
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,750
But...

58
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,150
He's right. They need to eat anyway.

59
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,120
- Let's go.
- Yes.

60
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,449
- Let's all go.
- Okay.

61
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,449
- Come along.
- Let's go.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,289
Come on.

63
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,930
Your parents live
quite far from here.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,729
It'll be a long commute.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,430
It can't be helped.

66
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,639
Have you been to her house?

67
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:19,840
Yes. She bought me a hamburger.

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
You left me out?

69
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,639
You weren't around. I told you.

70
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,550
It was when Yeong Gon stalked her,
so I had to take her home.

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,449
- That loser?
- Yes.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,949
Why do losers follow you to
every class you go to?

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,750
I saw what happened
outside the language institute.

74
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,189
What's your problem?

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,229
Why must other guys
protect your girlfriend?

76
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,500
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,439
Well, it wasn't a big deal.

78
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:57,340
It was just a guy who seemed to
talk nonsense all the time.

79
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,039
Tell me about things like that
from now on, okay?

80
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,150
Okay.

81
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,349
Let's eat.

82
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,849
He must care a lot about you.

83
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,819
Lucky for you.

84
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,090
Why do part-time employers
care so much about...

85
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,729
one's education?

86
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,089
Can't middle-schoolers
work these days?

87
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,129
Are you saying
you're in middle school?

88
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,470
I mean graduates.

89
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,199
- A middle school graduate?
- Yes.

90
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,100
Are you looking for work?

91
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,209
I need to start looking.
It's tough, isn't it?

92
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,069
- It is.
- My parents are hiring.

93
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,110
- Who wants in?
- Me!

94
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,240
Me.

95
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,149
You live far away.

96
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,550
Oh, right. I guess
you can take the job.

97
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,750
Where? What work is it?

98
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,550
- Near Byeongjeom...
- Joon.

99
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,459
Don't.

100
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,620
- Go on.
- The store's near Byeongjeom.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,889
It's so small that no one comes in.

102
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,959
- Really?
- Yes.

103
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,029
That's perfect. I'm in.

104
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,529
Are you trying to mess things up?

105
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,199
Mum's the one who's hiring,
not you.

106
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,800
I want to help.

107
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,339
Don't, you idiot.

108
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,939
That's enough. It can't be helped.

109
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,709
It's okay. Don't let it get to you.

110
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,839
Don't worry.

111
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,750
- I'll be there.
- Deal.

112
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,949
Right, that pervert.
Are they still looking for him?

113
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,319
He raided flats from here
all the way to our campus.

114
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,689
What kind of a pervert
steals women's underwear?

115
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,790
Does he steal them to make knives?

116
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,730
Was that a joke?

117
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,430
- Where did you learn that?
- It was wordplay.

118
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,430
Did you learn humour from a book?

119
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,639
She used a word
that also means "large knife".

120
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,540
You should be glad to move out
before he got to you.

121
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,240
Yes, I'm so glad.

122
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:39,339
A two-hour commute is no joke.

123
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,949
I feel sorry for you.

124
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,279
Let's make a toast
for Seol's long commute.

125
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,750
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

126
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,949
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

127
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,620
- Is this something to cheer about?
- Cheers.

128
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,029
- I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

129
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,990
- I got wet, too.
- It was a mistake.

130
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm fine.

131
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,860
It's your last night here.
Let's stay up.

132
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,720
I have to pack.

133
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,089
We'll all help.

134
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,699
Not today.

135
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,829
- Come on.
- Next time.

136
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,329
We'll go and get snacks and drinks.

137
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,339
- We'll pay for everything.
- I can't, not today.

138
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,199
- Let's go.
- See you.

139
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,740
- Don't be long.
- Next time.

140
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,680
I really have to pack.

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,250
Are you all staying?

142
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,050
Of course.

143
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,819
I have to clean up,
so take your time.

144
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,329
Joon, slow them down.

145
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,629
- Okay.
- Why do you need to clean up?

146
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,529
You're moving out.

147
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,939
How much longer
are you going to stay?

148
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,009
I have to stay and help
the children of my future employer.

149
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,350
Don't you worry. I plan to take over
their whole neighbourhood.

150
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,250
If the pervert comes by
their home or store,

151
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,449
I will beat him up
and teach him a lesson.

152
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,560
Working with you
will be so much fun.

153
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,019
But my mum won't be...

154
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,290
I'll go ahead.

155
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,040
What took you so long?
I was waiting for you.

156
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,449
Where do you think you're going?

157
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,250
I've been watching you,

158
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,180
and you're the centre of corruption.

159
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,850
There's a pervert next door,
and you let boys in...

160
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,389
whenever you want.

161
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,730
Do your parents know
you're up to no good?

162
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,629
You're dead now.

163
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,800
Who are you?

164
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:15,829
Let her go this instant.

165
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,170
Sure.

166
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,439
Here. Take her.

167
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,279
Seol. Are you all right?

168
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:42,389
Get him!

169
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,059
What?

170
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,700
He's the brick guy.

171
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,850
Hey! Are you okay?

172
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,950
What happened?

173
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,649
Should we call 911?

174
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,289
It's me.

175
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,730
How's my sister?

176
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,330
She's hurt.

177
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,960
How bad is it?

178
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,330
I'll get that scumbag!

179
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,740
- She's hurt?
- Yes.

180
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,940
I'll kill him when I get
my hands on him.

181
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,710
We looked everywhere
but couldn't find him.

182
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,179
I'll be right there.

183
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,809
Stay with Eun Taek and Bo Ra.

184
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,279
Don't go.

185
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
You need to see a doctor.

186
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,950
Look after her.

187
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,350
Be careful.

188
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,490
Jung.

189
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,830
Where did he go?

190
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:52,799
Where could he have gone?

191
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,539
He must be hiding.

192
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,639
Where is he?

193
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,149
Darn it!

194
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,149
That coward.
He's afraid to come out.

195
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,549
Stay right where you are!

196
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,389
Darn!

197
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,019
Wait until I get my hands on you!

198
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,929
You brick-head!

199
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,289
Where did he go?

200
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,750
I'm done here.

201
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,279
I should get going.

202
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,820
Here you are.

203
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Hey!

204
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,289
Let go.

205
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,830
Not my head!

206
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:02,629
Why would they go after the
criminal? Tell them to come back.

207
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,440
They won't pick up.

208
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,539
- You need to see a doctor.
- Please help us.

209
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,740
- I'll go look for them.
- Be careful.

210
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
- Help me.
- Sure.

211
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,750
She did see you here last time.

212
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
I just don't get it.

213
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,000
Why do people like you
always get away?

214
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,870
- It suits you.
- You jerk.

215
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Did that hurt?

216
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,549
It's what you did to her.

217
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,350
Does she know what you do?

218
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,519
Does that girl know
you're a lunatic?

219
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,419
Yes.

220
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,929
She's just like me.

221
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,629
Whatever.

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,429
Look at what you did to me.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,299
That girl will never understand you.

224
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,440
People like her won't
understand people like us.

225
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,210
How are you different from me?
You aren't.

226
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,179
We should have
parked the car nearby.

227
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,549
- Leave me alone!
- Stop right there!

228
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,289
He's over here!

229
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,289
- It's not me!
- Be careful.

230
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,289
- I'm not the culprit!
- Stay right here.

231
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,730
- Okay.
- Both of you.

232
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,429
Aren't they after the wrong guy?

233
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,799
Go and explain.

234
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,639
- Will you be okay?
- Yes, just go.

235
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,169
Mister!

236
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,509
Where is Jung?

237
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,620
Stop, stop. Wait.

238
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,029
I know what the future
will be like for you.

239
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,330
Everyone you know will leave you.

240
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,029
Even that girl...

241
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,769
will turn on you one day.

242
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,220
That hurts!

243
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,350
It hurts. Stop.

244
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:37,120
- You steal with these hands.
- Stop.

245
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,059
Shall I break your hand for you?

246
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,539
The accident...

247
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,049
was Jung's fault.

248
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,230
Seol.

249
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,200
Why are you alone?
Where are the others?

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,840
- Jung.
- Seol.

251
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,340
Seol.

252
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:32,340
Are you okay?

253
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,450
How do you feel?

254
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,279
There he is.

255
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,250
Stand up.

256
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,450
Get up.

257
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,659
Get on my back.

258
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,000
We'll take her to the hospital.

259
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,940
Jung didn't have to stay at
the police station for long.

260
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,909
The thief...

261
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,950
- wasn't the landlady's grandson.
- Attempted rape, special larceny.

262
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,820
He owned a fake travel agency.

263
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,190
He had sent my landlady
on a fake overseas tour,

264
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,429
which ended up with her
being detained abroad.

265
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,029
What's wrong with me?

266
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,840
Be honest. The girls
who flirt with guys and...

267
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,809
bring them home
are the real problem.

268
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,909
No one's sane in this day and age.
Everyone's a bit kooky.

269
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,610
Go out onto the street
and you'll find guys worse than me.

270
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,080
- Don't you agree?
- I don't agree, you idiot.

271
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,090
He talks nonsense
and is a bit confused.

272
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,419
If the court decides that
he's mentally incompetent,

273
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,220
he might get off lightly.

274
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,830
Jerks like that should be
locked up behind bars.

275
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,860
Is Ju Yong cleared then?

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes. The suspect
admitted to that, too.

277
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,940
He said he left the underwear
in Ju Yong's room.

278
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,799
I'll let you rest, then.

279
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,210
Thank you. Bye.

280
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,639
All is well.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,710
I wasn't that badly hurt.

282
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,850
- You didn't have to visit.
- Don't mind me.

283
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,149
I heard that you know...

284
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,250
the person who helped.

285
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,320
- Yes.
- Give this to him for me.

286
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,200
And this is for you.
Take it, will you?

287
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,830
Thank you.

288
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,070
You don't need to come
to work tomorrow.

289
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
There's no need to come
to work any more.

290
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,110
Bye.

291
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,639
Thank you.

292
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,149
Jung's waiting outside.

293
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,950
My bones are fine.

294
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,049
I can walk just fine.

295
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,420
I see.

296
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,190
I'm relieved.

297
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,799
Thanks for helping me.

298
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
From now on,

299
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,069
I wish you don't overdo yourself.

300
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,809
I regret it, too.

301
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,319
Fine.

302
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,750
He did it for me.

303
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,019
So it's okay.

304
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,029
Vacation is almost over.

305
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,769
I might need your help
this semester.

306
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,730
Sure.

307
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,769
Me, too.

308
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,740
This will be
our last semester together.

309
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,349
I don't know what will happen,

310
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,549
but won't it be better...

311
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,950
with Jung around?

312
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,420
I was wrong.

313
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,289
I forgot about the long commute.

314
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,930
Four-hour round-trip to classes.

315
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,640
Hey. Are you alone?

316
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,809
Where is he?

317
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,009
No one knows I'm seeing Jung.

318
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,349
I hope these two don't tell anyone.

319
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,849
Hello, Seol.

320
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,259
- Who are you?
- It's me, Min Soo.

321
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,990
Oh.

322
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,700
Do I look weird without glasses?

323
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:25,000
No. You became prettier.

324
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,170
Really? Thank you. You, too.

325
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,309
I mean, you were always pretty.

326
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,049
How was your holiday?

327
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,259
Fine. I had a good time.
Did you enjoy your holiday?

328
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,329
- Yes.
- You look a lot like Seol.

329
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:52,160
I've always liked her style.

330
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,500
I guess you and I have
similar preferences.

331
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,430
You think so?

332
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,069
I guess you did.

333
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,170
- Right?
- What were you writing?

334
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,640
- Seol.
- Come over here.

335
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,349
- Hello.
- You took your time.

336
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,279
You can sit here.

337
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,119
- Hello.
- Scoot over.

338
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,930
- Sit somewhere else.
- Move over.

339
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,829
You must've gotten really close
over the holiday.

340
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,700
He just couldn't find a seat.

341
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,700
- We're dating.
- What?

342
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,170
You two are dating?

343
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:35,940
You're dating Seol?

344
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,210
I'm done for.

345
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,650
What are you writing?

346
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:55,089
I wasn't prepared.
Did you have to tell everyone?

347
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,529
It's nothing to hide.

348
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:01,700
Are they really dating?

349
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,430
This is unbelievable.

350
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,809
I just wasn't prepared.
This is still new to me.

351
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,339
Get used to it fast.

352
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,349
Let's not hold hands in public.

353
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,779
Why not? I want the
whole world to know.

354
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,390
Are you two dating? So am I.

355
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,930
There you are. At last.

356
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,799
Hello. How are you?

357
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,700
What's that?

358
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,900
Yeong Gon's back.

359
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,299
- Give them back.
- I'll carry them for you.

360
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,940
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

361
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,640
My internship begins next week,
so I won't be around much.

362
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,910
Call me right away
if he bothers you.

363
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,150
An internship?
Did you get into Taerang Group?

364
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,920
That's great.

365
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,450
Just as an intern, though.

366
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,460
Even so. It must be hard
to get a paid internship there.

367
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:02,789
- Is it?
- Good for you.

368
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,630
Hello, I'm Baek In Ho,
a friend of your daughter's.

369
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,839
Are you really my daughter's friend?

370
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,910
I am. We're very good friends.

371
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
He used to teach at
her language institute.

372
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,339
He can take care of the foreigners.

373
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,150
Why would you work here
instead of teaching?

374
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:28,089
For several reasons.

375
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,019
I'm good at lifting heavy things,
and I'll do anything you need, Boss.

376
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,920
I'm the boss.

377
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,529
You do look fit enough.

378
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,329
Start by mopping the floor.

379
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,730
- Sure.
- You, too.

380
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,740
You'll get it done much faster
with two mops.

381
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,440
Have fun.

382
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,109
Where do you think you're going?
This is yours.

383
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:56,750
Get to work.

384
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,690
It's not an easy gig at all.
She works me from day to night.

385
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,829
You're wearing an apron.

386
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:14,799
It suits you.

387
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,240
I look good in everything.

388
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,740
Wait and see.
I'll make this place famous.

389
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,279
Aren't you embarrassed to say that
with your own mouth?

390
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,710
Not at all.

391
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,480
I was born with good looks.
I might as well make good use of it.

392
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,849
Great. You're finally home.

393
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,359
Take over.

394
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,819
- Hey.
- I'm going home.

395
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,630
Come back here.
You aren't going anywhere.

396
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,630
Can't I take a break?

397
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,829
No. If you take a break,
your parents have to work extra.

398
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,930
Get inside.

399
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,240
- But I...
- Go on inside.

400
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,039
He hired the wrong person.

401
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,440
Put that in the fridge.

402
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,549
- I'm home.
- Hello.

403
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:04,009
- How was your day?
- Good.

404
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,529
Is that guy really your friend?

405
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,329
- Why?
- Let's sweep the floor.

406
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:24,900
Yes.

407
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,339
Is he your boyfriend?

408
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,809
He isn't. My boyfriend's
two years older.

409
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,140
Then is he in his fourth year?

410
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,549
Where will he work at?

411
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,650
I don't know.

412
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,819
Do you know anything about him?

413
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,819
I won't have you dating a guy
without a plan or a dream...

414
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,690
about the future, okay?

415
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,230
Or one who daydreams about
starting a business.

416
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,430
What did you say?

417
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,630
Are you referring to me?

418
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,799
I'm going home. You close up.

419
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,269
Okay.

420
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,809
I do trust you,
but you can never be too careful...

421
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,450
when it comes to
picking a guy, okay?

422
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,150
- Yes.
- Gosh.

423
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,049
Look at my life.

424
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,319
I know. I should have cared more.

425
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:25,430
Jung's just an intern and must be
worried about getting a job.

426
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,430
He hides his thoughts too well.

427
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,140
Where will I end up working at?

428
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,539
When will I end up getting married?

429
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,109
Who will I get married to?

430
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,180
With Jung?

431
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:51,759
What's wrong with me?
What am I thinking?

432
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,089
Now I'm just being silly.

433
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,730
His girlfriend is...

434
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,539
the class weirdo-loser-combo girl.

435
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,640
They're both...

436
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,839
Hang on. Why did Jung
force me on her...

437
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,079
if he was going to
end up dating her anyway?

438
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,119
Was he messing with me?

439
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:22,750
Wait and see.
You're sorely mistaken...

440
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,359
if you think I'm
the same old Yeong Gon.

441
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,230
I'm Oh Yeong Gon, remember?

442
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,730
Will you stop hanging out with us
now that you have a boyfriend?

443
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,799
This is how friendships end.
I saw it happen many times.

444
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,900
How about the four of us
eat lunch together?

445
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,140
- No thanks. Bye.
- We'll eat without you.

446
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,079
- Why?
- Hong Seol.

447
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,640
You surprise me.

448
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,450
What do you want with her now?

449
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,950
Are you really dating Jung?

450
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,250
- I warned...
- Leave her alone.

451
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,349
Hey.

452
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:01,119
Keep this up and I'll tell everyone
what you did to me.

453
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,329
Do you want to die?

454
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,829
Go ahead, tell everyone.

455
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,130
Do you know
who it will hurt the most?

456
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,970
You just wait and see.
I'll show you the true colours...

457
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,740
of your sweet boyfriend.

458
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,740
What shall we eat? Meat?

459
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,440
- Meat again?
- Of course.

460
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,849
That's when things got worse...

461
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,549
between me and Yeong Gon.

462
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,319
Meat is on me.

463
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,019
You're so weak.

464
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:33,460
It was around the time
Jung was giving me...

465
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,920
- a hard time.
- The loser pays for dinner.

466
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,990
I hope our team wins.

467
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,359
Let's cheer. Ready? Go.

468
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,529
Go, Business Administration!

469
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,069
Good luck!

470
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,740
- Kwon Eun Taek!
- Kwon Eun Taek!

471
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,539
Here I come, the hero to the rescue.

472
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,940
I'm your hero and I'm finally here.

473
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,180
- What's wrong with him?
- Get lost.

474
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,650
Bo Ra, forget about Eun Taek.

475
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,549
I'll win the game for you.

476
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,750
Here I come!

477
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,359
Why is he bothering you?
Didn't he like Ju Yeon?

478
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,119
He bothers everyone.

479
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,230
- It's best to ignore him.
- Sang Cheol, Sang Cheol.

480
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,029
Stop, stop.

481
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,730
Jung's playing instead.

482
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,329
You said I could!

483
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,829
200 dollars is on the line.
We need the best guys.

484
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,039
Our pride is at stake.

485
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,839
Jae Woo's in and he's under 170cm!

486
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,210
Okay, okay.

487
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,410
- Fine.
- Dwarf!

488
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,279
- Pass it to me!
- Stay here.

489
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,549
If we win, you can eat
whatever you want.

490
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,849
We'll win this for you.
We have Jung.

491
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,190
Pass it to Jung. Shoot.

492
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:38,990
Did you see that?

493
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,730
- Over here.
- Shoot.

494
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,430
Nice!

495
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,049
We're unbeatable!

496
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,089
Come with me.

497
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,319
- What for?
- You'll find out.

498
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,289
Let go of me.

499
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,190
I have something to say!

500
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,200
- You're hurting me.
- Let go.

501
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,059
Don't you see they're playing?

502
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,170
I don't want to talk to you.

503
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,329
Let go of her hand.

504
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,200
Leave the girls alone.

505
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,839
What if I won't?

506
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,849
What will you do about it?

507
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,279
What do you think?

508
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,849
Do you want to start
a fight or something?

509
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,349
Go ahead. Punch me if you want to.

510
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,920
Don't you know that
I'm older than you?

511
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,289
- Punch me.
- Stop it.

512
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,730
Let go of me! I'm not done with him!

513
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,089
- That's enough.
- What's your problem?

514
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,059
Have you lost your mind?

515
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,430
Why did you punch Jung?

516
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,730
I got hit in the face, too!

517
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:01,299
Do you see this? I'm bleeding.
Is he bleeding? He isn't.

518
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,009
Watch your tongue.

519
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,940
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

520
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,980
He didn't do it on purpose.

521
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,180
- Get your nose checked.
- What?

522
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,079
Stop trying to pretend
to be the nice guy.

523
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,950
You're so full of yourself.

524
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,559
- What's his deal?
- He's out of his mind.

525
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,089
- He's a joke.
- Stop dreaming, all of you.

526
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,630
Do you think he cares about you?

527
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,529
He doesn't. He's just nice to you
because he pities you.

528
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,829
He's superficial.

529
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,140
- You're so ignorant.
- What's wrong with him?

530
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,740
Can't you see through him?
Are you that blinded?

531
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,410
- Stop talking gibberish.
- He's superficial.

532
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,910
- Look who's talking.
- You're worse than him.

533
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,750
- What are you saying?
- Unbelievable.

534
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,349
Don't make matters worse.
Just apologise to Jung.

535
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,750
Apologise and get your act together.

536
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,630
I'm really sorry.

537
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,529
I was mistaken.

538
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,930
I was upset at the girls and just...

539
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,200
I don't mind.
Get your face looked at.

540
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,309
Jung, I'm sorry.

541
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,339
Are you angry? Forgive me.

542
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,180
Yeong Gon, you better pay
for dinner.

543
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,920
I kind of feel bad for him.

544
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:31,029
There was some truth
in what he said earlier.

545
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,539
Are you okay?

546
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,220
You shouldn't have
said those things.

547
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,250
Apologise to Bo Ra
when you get the chance.

548
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,890
Hey.

549
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,430
The reason the girls
don't like you is because...

550
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,529
you're not sincere enough.

551
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,339
Instead of being so forceful,

552
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,069
try to be sincere and honest
and take it step by step.

553
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
That's how you should
approach girls.

554
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,750
Got it?

555
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,529
Drink this.

556
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:41,960
I shouldn't have tried
to console him.

557
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:47,240
Ever since that day,
Yeong Gon got fixated on me.

558
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,970
It got worse every day.

559
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,180
What's wrong? Did I scare you?

560
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,750
What do you think?

561
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,819
What are you doing here?

562
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,619
I met a friend nearby
and was on my way home.

563
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,329
Do you live around here?

564
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,329
I'll walk you home.

565
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,430
No. I'll be fine.

566
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,140
You told me to be sincere.

567
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,269
I sincerely like you.

568
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,970
Why can't you see that?

569
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,240
That's not what I meant.

570
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,440
I don't like you.

571
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,650
That's not true.

572
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,190
You're just playing
hard to get, aren't you?

573
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,619
Don't because you're just
making me more excited. Come back.

574
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,829
Why won't he stop?

575
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,109
I told you not to
send me presents! Just stop!

576
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,980
Didn't you like it?
It wasn't exactly cheap.

577
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,309
- That's not the issue.
- Calm down.

578
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:06,180
And don't ever call me.

579
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,019
Jung told me you would love it
if I bought you something expensive.

580
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,659
I should go to the gym.
Look at my stomach.

581
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,329
Hello.

582
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,099
I want to ask you something.

583
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,039
Yeong Gon said that
you told him that I like him.

584
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:33,639
Now thanks to you,
he's been following me around.

585
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,250
What's wrong with him?

586
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,050
Remember when he punched Jung
during the basketball match?

587
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,550
He stalked Jung and
followed him everywhere.

588
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,460
Then he said that you were...

589
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,519
the only one who cared about him.

590
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,289
All Jung did was agree with him.

591
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,530
He's trash.

592
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,329
I apologise.
He misunderstood what I meant.

593
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,139
So you just went along with
Yeong Gon's ramblings...

594
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,739
and he's the one to blame?

595
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,539
Is he the one with the problem?

596
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,949
Yes, he is. He's a nutcase.

597
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,320
Sorry.

598
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,550
For some reason...

599
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,289
Yeong Gon suddenly disappeared
that very day.

600
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,820
Something about that bothered me,

601
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,530
and I had no choice
but to let it slide.

602
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,199
Why should I let it bother me?

603
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,030
Yeong Gon was talking nonsense.

604
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,300
Yes. That has to be it.

605
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,179
Jung.

606
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,110
Who cares? Everyone knows.

607
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,449
You might be fine with it,
but I'm not.

608
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:51,190
People I've never met before
ask me if we're really dating.

609
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,659
Then they scan me from head to toe.

610
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,329
It's as if they don't believe it.

611
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:59,530
They glare at me as
if I don't deserve you.

612
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,929
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

613
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:08,639
I should buy a pair of sunglasses.

614
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:11,440
I'm too famous to
show my face in public.

615
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:19,849
This shop is our last hope.
We can't afford to lose it.

616
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,849
He can't dream of
making it big forever.

617
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,289
Don't worry about it too much.

618
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,389
He'll grow up soon.

619
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,730
I'll talk to him for you.

620
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,090
- Please. Please do.
- I will.

621
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,599
Is he your new part-timer?

622
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,199
Yes.

623
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,000
He's not too bad.

624
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,539
He's pretty strong.
And he puts Joon to work.

625
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:48,739
You know I'm redoing
the interior of my cafe, don't you?

626
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,949
I need someone to
take out the trash.

627
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,449
Could I borrow him?

628
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,449
Of course, I'll pay his wages.

629
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:58,650
- In Ho.
- Yes?

630
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,289
This is my brother-in-law

631
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,230
and he needs some help.

632
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,929
Would you mind?
He offered to pay you.

633
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,429
Will he? I'd like that.

634
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,309
Have a drink.

635
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,579
- Thank you.
- You did a lot today.

636
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,039
You're good.

637
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,750
- Did that cool you down?
- Yes.

638
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,750
The warehouse is next.
It's over there.

639
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,190
- The warehouse?
- It's this big.

640
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,219
Sure.

641
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,630
What a mess.

642
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,239
It's so messy.

643
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,000
Where did you find him?
You must be pleased.

644
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,639
He'd be so successful
if only he didn't have a temper.

645
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,449
Well done.

646
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,650
You look so good in your uniform

647
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,090
You look so good even
without gel on your hair

648
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,929
Your hair shines
and that's why you're mine.

649
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,260
You're mine, so just wait for me.

650
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:03,309
Is this an abstract painting?

651
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:07,340
- It's not done yet.
- This is incredible.

652
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,739
Hang on.

653
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,750
Is this him?

654
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:13,579
Jung, it's you.

655
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:17,650
This doesn't look like him at all.
You call this a painting?

656
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,820
Stop teasing her. It's not too bad.

657
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,760
Are you defending her again?
Stop taking her side.

658
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,530
You're the reason...

659
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,329
she wants to study abroad
and hold an exhibition.

660
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,170
Let's be honest.

661
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,139
You won't give up because our aunt
didn't let you take lessons.

662
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:37,110
You aren't good enough.
As your brother...

663
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,840
Shut your mouth!

664
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,909
- Are you mad?
- I'll kill you!

665
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,079
Stop it.

666
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,550
You think you're all that
because you play a few tunes.

667
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,820
Watch out because
one day I might just...

668
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:51,619
smash your fingers with
the lid of the piano, okay?

669
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,019
That's enough.

670
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,530
What a psycho.
She doesn't know her place.

671
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,809
In Ha quit the art club.

672
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,980
Did she?

673
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,710
Good for her.

674
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,849
Can you at least pretend
that you care?

675
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,519
Don't you feel sorry for her?
She wants to do better but can't.

676
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,550
That's why people quit.

677
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,389
Let's go shoot some hoops.

678
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:33,230
Where is it? It's worth at least
a few thousand dollars.

679
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,000
Where are you, dear crocodile?

680
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,940
Not you. You're a precious
limited edition item.

681
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,340
Where are you, red crocodile?

682
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,349
What's this?

683
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,750
Why are you still here?

684
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,739
I didn't know back then...

685
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,639
what it meant...

686
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,809
to give up a dream.

687
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,550
How it feels like...

688
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,519
to remember
what you're incapable of.

689
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:52,309
Wait.

690
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:55,280
It's not plugged in.

691
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,179
Where's the plug?

692
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,050
I lost track of time.

693
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:06,820
You should go and help out
with the dinner crowd.

694
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:08,590
Right.

695
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,130
I'll come back in the evening.
I should finish up.

696
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,530
I'd love that. You should go.

697
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,300
They'll be very busy.

698
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,639
I love not having to take the tube.

699
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,170
I'll drive you home whenever I can.

700
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:27,239
Think of it as a date.

701
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,949
How are your classmates?

702
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:35,179
Everyone's worried about
finding a job.

703
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,820
What do you want to do
after you graduate?

704
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,659
I don't know.

705
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,230
I considered studying abroad.

706
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:47,699
Going abroad to study?
What about me, then?

707
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,699
I'll see how the internship goes.

708
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,170
Isn't it hard to get
a full-time job at Taerang?

709
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:58,940
Actually...

710
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,750
Taerang Group...

711
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,949
is my dad's company.

712
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:11,920
What?

713
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:15,590
Don't tell the others.

714
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,659
I want to start from
the bottom and climb up.

715
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,460
So he's one of those rich kids.

716
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,929
He's from a whole different world.

717
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:30,409
My parents run a noodle shop,

718
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,780
and Joon might not even graduate.

719
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,980
I might not even get an internship.

720
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,150
But him...

721
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,719
What do you think you'll be doing
five years from now?

722
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,530
I'll probably be learning
on how to run the company.

723
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,630
I suddenly feel so small.

724
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,860
And...

725
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,929
there's no place for me...

726
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,199
in his future.

727
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,170
What's wrong?

728
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,139
Is it something I said?

729
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,039
No.

730
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,750
Well...

731
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:15,019
I just wondered...

732
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,650
if I would...

733
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,119
be by your side
even after you graduate.

734
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,030
I just had that thought.

735
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,630
It's up there.

736
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:30,929
Turn left.

737
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,429
- Here?
- Yes.

738
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,010
This is it.

739
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,210
- Thanks for the lift.
- Seol.

740
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,650
Don't worry about that.

741
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,420
Sorry.

742
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,050
I was just nervous.

743
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,630
No.

744
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,329
I can't just send him
away like this.

745
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,269
I need to do something.

746
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,210
- Jung.
- What?

747
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,280
Seol, wait.

748
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,730
I have to go.

749
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,039
Seol...

750
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,960
Seol, Seol.

751
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,260
Joon.

752
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,659
You don't have an umbrella?

753
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,260
Why are you here?

754
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,730
Why aren't you helping out
at the restaurant?

755
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,440
Did you drink again?

756
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,940
What is wrong with you?

757
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,980
That's In Ha.

758
00:47:57,179 --> 00:47:58,550
What's he doing?

759
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:05,389
What?

760
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,760
I can buy you if I want.

761
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,659
In Ha.

762
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,690
Over here.

763
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,559
Hey.

764
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,170
What are you doing here?

765
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,739
Walk me home.

766
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,840
I have to go somewhere.

767
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:26,340
Please. Take me home.

768
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,539
Seol, come here.

769
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:32,349
You two really know how to
take advantage of someone.

770
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,519
Hold this.

771
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,820
I feel generous today,
but you owe me dinner.

772
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:40,889
You wish.

773
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,159
- I'm getting wet.
- Come closer.

774
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:57,070
- I'm home.
- I'm home.

775
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,909
Where did you meet up?

776
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,440
How did you manage
without an umbrella?

777
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,880
We met In Ha on the way.

778
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,980
He's on his way to
your uncle's warehouse.

779
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:10,190
He went over to help your uncle
with the cleaning up,

780
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,360
and he offered to clean
the warehouse tonight free of charge.

781
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,059
Why? Is Uncle buying him
drinks instead?

782
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,530
You need to grow up.

783
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,800
You're taking a break from school,
but I need you to earn your tuition.

784
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:27,070
Please, Joon.

785
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:31,070
Will you please be
half as good as your sister?

786
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,440
You should've sent her
abroad instead, then.

787
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,309
Well done.

788
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,550
Don't you dare say that
in front of Dad.

789
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,650
If only I could hit you.

790
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,719
Joon.

791
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,030
- Mum.
- What?

792
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,460
Does Uncle still have
the electronic piano?

793
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,469
I think so.

794
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,670
- What the...
- Gosh.

795
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,710
You scared me.

796
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,280
Is this what you were looking at?

797
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,079
What?

798
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,550
And these.

799
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,460
Use them whenever you want.

800
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,159
How did you know?

801
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,170
It just needs to be plugged in.

802
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:32,170
What is this?

803
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,369
Who are these for?

804
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,170
- Unbelievable.
- I just brought it.

805
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,440
Just in case.

806
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,539
What's this?

807
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,610
Why did you bring this book?

808
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:46,679
Why does it say
"Red Seol" on the back?

809
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,980
Give me a break.

810
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,489
From second grade?

811
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:55,289
"I got a compliment. I felt good."

812
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,429
"Piano is fun."

813
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:02,059
"I'll do better tomorrow."
Good for you.

814
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,869
Are these a bit too easy for you?

815
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,699
I didn't think that far.

816
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,239
I'll take this back with me, then.

817
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,179
You can't.

818
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:18,550
- It's mine.
- You gave it to me.

819
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:20,480
- You don't need it.
- Are you upset?

820
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,780
- No.
- Leave it, then.

821
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:25,190
- You are angry. You are.
- What's wrong with you?

822
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,159
You can use it.
Good luck playing the piano.

823
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,030
- You did that on purpose, right?
- Good luck.

824
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:35,360
Why you...

825
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,969
She got me.

826
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:48,179
She got me good.

827
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,630
I feel generous today,

828
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,070
- but you owe me dinner.
- You wish.

829
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:48,170
- I'm getting wet.
- Come closer.

830
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,699
Now you finally pick up.

831
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,630
Unsuspend my credit cards!

832
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,840
Did you just ignore me?

833
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
You're the one
who won't go to classes.

834
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:27,079
Move out of the apartment.
I'm selling it off this month.

835
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,659
I hate my life.

836
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,159
- Good morning.
- Hi, Professor.

837
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,860
- Did you have breakfast?
- Yes.

838
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:51,869
- I was too busy to.
- Right.

839
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,070
Here they are.

840
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,269
Why are there only two?

841
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,179
I teach four classes this semester.
Print out the other one.

842
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,550
Well, you see...

843
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,449
Why are you stammering?

844
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:09,019
The thing is...

845
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,750
Some of your classes got cancelled.

846
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,159
- Cancelled?
- Yes.

847
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:19,059
- Why?
- It's the team project thing.

848
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:22,530
- What about it?
- Students grade the professors,

849
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,369
and we can't ignore their feedback.

850
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,769
- I suggest you be nice to...
- How dare you?

851
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,710
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

852
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,110
Would you like some water?

853
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,019
You finish it.

854
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,389
Organisational behaviour.

855
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:52,659
I heard something
through the grapevine.

856
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,929
Some of you do not seem to like
how I assign team projects.

857
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,170
What don't you like about it?

858
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,639
I stress communication
in all of my classes...

859
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,679
and what we have is
the utter lack of it.

860
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,880
Do you think that makes any sense?

861
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,780
Does it?

862
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:21,019
I hoped that you would understand
my grand philosophy.

863
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:22,659
Was it too much to ask?

864
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:24,659
Does that mean...

865
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:28,530
I must stoop to your level
just to get my message across?

866
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:30,630
Does it?

867
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,940
Open your textbooks.

868
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,070
Chapter one.

869
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:44,150
Fine. I will mark you individually
this semester.

870
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:48,420
Study the material as a team,
but give individual presentations.

871
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,190
I will mark you as a team,
but individually as well.

872
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:57,059
If you end up with a freeloader
who doesn't do any of the work,

873
00:55:57,429 --> 00:56:00,760
don't add his or her name in
the final paper.

874
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,530
Omit their name, okay?

875
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,000
- Yes.
- Louder. Okay?

876
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

877
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:13,369
So this is Yonyi University?
It's huge.

878
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,380
We should eat here.

879
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,949
- Of course.
- Let's call Seol.

880
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,980
Do it.

881
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:26,550
Let's see...

882
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,130
Why isn't she picking up?

883
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,860
Is she in a lecture?

884
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,739
I think the Business Building's
over there. Let's check it out.

885
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,980
You go ahead. I want to
drop by somewhere else first.

886
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,079
Where?

887
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,860
It will help increase
the quality of working life.

888
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,800
Let's take a 10 minute break.

889
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,469
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

890
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,179
I'm here with In Ho.

891
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,579
Call me in 10 minutes
or I'll call Jung.

892
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:32,090
Seol, I made sandwiches.
Do you want some?

893
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,159
- I have drinks, too.
- Next time. Sorry.

894
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,360
Where are you going?

895
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,800
You dropped this.

896
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,670
It's Seol's.

897
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,670
It's cute, just like her.

898
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:52,070
Why won't he pick up?
Is his phone dead?

899
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:56,409
Why can't I reach him when
he just sent me a message?

900
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,760
- Hi.
- Hello? Where are you?

901
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,130
Me?

902
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,159
Are you by the Music Department?

903
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,369
Why would I be?
I'm in the men's bathroom.

904
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:20,969
Hello?

905
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,309
The Music Department.

906
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,849
Wait. Stop.

907
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,559
Baek In Ho?

908
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,460
Do you know me?

909
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,360
Of course I do. You were
Professor Noh's pupil.

910
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:21,960
Don't you remember me?

911
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,670
You were his sidekick.

912
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,300
Yes, I was. Stop pointing fingers.

913
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,710
What are you doing here?

914
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,940
- I got lost.
- I see.

915
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,480
Wait.

916
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:39,849
Why haven't you called
Professor Noh?

917
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,380
- That's none of your business.
- Wait.

918
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,389
In Ho, stop.

919
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:49,820
Why won't either of them pick up?

920
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,260
Stop right there.

921
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,260
- In Ho.
- Leave me alone.

922
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,760
- Stop!
- In Ho.

923
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:56,559
- Don't chase me.
- In Ho!

924
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,570
- In Ho!
- You, Miss.

925
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,670
Hey, you.

926
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,610
Do you know In Ho?

927
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,010
- Pardon?
- Oh.

928
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,980
I'm a professor.

929
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,610
Does he study here?

930
01:00:13,579 --> 01:00:15,280
No, he doesn't.

931
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,920
Then pass him my business card.

932
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,559
- Sure.
- Tell him to come by.

933
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,260
- Please.
- Sure.

934
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:30,570
(Shin Myung Soo, Professor of Music)

935
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,269
My doll...

936
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:41,679
It's gone. Gosh!

937
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,280
Where did I drop it?

938
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,559
Seol, you searched the area
twice already.

939
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,159
- Stop looking.
- Just a bit more.

940
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:02,059
You bought it for me.

941
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,769
Why on earth did Joon
have to come here today?

942
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:08,840
I'll buy you another one.

943
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,309
Stop looking. I'll help you down.

944
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:26,949
Let's go.

945
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,360
One last time.

946
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:32,530
If it's not in my bag,
I'll stop looking.

947
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,269
It's not here. It's really gone.

948
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,800
"Professor of Music"?

949
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,639
A professor...

950
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:48,239
asked me to pass it on to In Ho.

951
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,480
I'll give it to him.

952
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,159
Are you planning to fight him again?

953
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,960
I'll just stop by the store
and give it to him.

954
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,789
- No.
- Is this such a big deal?

955
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,929
Yes, it is.

956
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,369
Then I'll tag along.

957
01:02:13,469 --> 01:02:16,139
I don't like it when you two fight.

958
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,469
Okay.

959
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,780
Let's go.

960
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,360
Me, play the piano?

961
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,769
Do you want to play the piano?

962
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,489
I asked you a question.

963
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,760
Professor Shin asked us to
give you this.

964
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:24,469
You must want to play
if that's where you went.

965
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,940
Shut your mouth.

966
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,079
Why do you care what I do?

967
01:03:29,179 --> 01:03:30,980
Study abroad.
I'll pay for the expenses.

968
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,989
Are you kidding me?

969
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:40,050
It's because I think
you changed your mind.

970
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,360
If you're trying to keep it
from me out of pride, don't.

971
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,829
I don't care what you end up doing.

972
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,969
But don't waste Seol's time
because you can't make up your mind.

973
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:57,239
Let's go.

974
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,139
Why did you say that?

975
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,809
It sounds like
you're picking a fight.

976
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,469
What did you do for five years?

977
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:35,010
We're done here. Go.

978
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,480
- Isn't this yours?
- It's mine.

979
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,380
- Are you copying me now?
- Hey, Seol wannabe.

980
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:40,679
Hey, you.

981
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:44,050
You need my permission
if you want to date Jung.

982
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,449
You curly redhead!

983
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:49,460
Will she stay with you
even after she finds out...

984
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:51,260
you set me on her?

985
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,460
I don't want you and In Ho
to be friends.

986
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,159
I don't want you to take sides...

987
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,170
or feel bothered.
