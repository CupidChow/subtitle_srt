1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:05,440
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,949
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,820
Do you want to go for food? Let's go.

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,719
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,929
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,129
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,500
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,030
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,909
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,750
- Seol! Congratulations.
- Bo Ra.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,020
I heard you got a scholarship.

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,520
- I'm proud of you, Seol!
- Eun Taek...

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,030
Let's celebrate!

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,829
Seol, you look amazing today.

15
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,500
Seol, treat us to food.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,030
Jung. That's Min Soo, not me.
Why are they acting like that?

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,670
Hey, Mad Hair.
I heard about the scholarship.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,439
Congratulations.

19
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,439
That's In Ho.
Jung.

20
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,069
- Jung.
- Seol!

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Congratulations.
Let's go for dinner.

22
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,340
Yes, let's go.

23
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,150
- Nice!
- Yes!

24
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,450
That's not me!

25
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:19,849
She's not me.

26
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,459
Where are you guys going?

27
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,329
Don't go.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,209
What was that about? What a crazy dream!

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,739
(Oh Yeong Gon)

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,950
Gosh, is he really crazy?

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,680
Is Seol not answering my calls?

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,950
Why isn't she picking up?

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,489
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

34
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,019
Fine.

35
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,129
You'll find out who the real jerk is
when you see this text message.

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,030
Will you be able to handle the truth?

37
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,370
Please.
I really hope that you can see the truth.

38
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,939
Open your eyes, Seol.

39
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,409
(Episode 9)

40
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,830
Even if small problems
shape up like little waves,

41
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,629
they're just little waves
that will disappear.

42
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,069
I can get through them
just like everyone else.

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,610
Hey, Hong Seol! Hong Seol!

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,439
Seol, wait! I have to talk to you.
Hey, come here.

45
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,310
Gosh, seriously!

46
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,849
Hey, I'm going to get you!
Stop! I have something to tell you!

47
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,750
Gosh! That girl is driving me nuts!

48
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,949
Gosh, I stayed up all night
at an internet cafe!

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,250
Go away, seriously!

50
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
Sang Cheol.

51
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,830
Why haven't you sent it yet?

52
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,229
Well, Jae Woo was supposed
to do half of it and send it to me...

53
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,969
Why is Jae Woo doing it? It's yours.

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,669
Well, give me more time.

55
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,740
How can you ask for more time
when you already got extra time?

56
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,039
Plus, the extended deadline passed.
It was three days ago.

57
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,840
Trust me, I'm working on it now.
I'm just finishing it up.

58
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,379
I'll send it to you by 11pm tonight, okay?

59
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,180
Everyone else has already sent theirs.

60
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:35,419
- You must send it by 11pm tonight.
- Okay.

61
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,560
- This is really the last time.
- I got it.

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,629
Trust me, Seol.

63
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,229
But if those little waves
keep snarling and slapping you,

64
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:55,139
you can't just sit there
and endure it all.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,819
Hey, Seol. I'm so sorry for
not getting in touch with you.

66
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,349
I had a family emergency.

67
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,650
Gosh, I can't believe
Jae Woo refused to help me.

68
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,289
You saw it too.

69
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,460
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

70
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,230
Is this our presentation script?

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,470
Wow. I'll memorise it quickly
and do a good job at the presentation.

72
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,740
Gosh, this is so neat.
You never disappoint me, Seol.

73
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,339
Wait.
Hold on.

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,339
I took your name out.

75
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,040
I told you last time.

76
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,410
You didn't participate,
so I omitted your name.

77
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,250
Hey.
Are you kidding me right now?

78
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,120
Did I intentionally not work on it?

79
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,860
I told you that I had a family emergency!

80
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,720
Look.
I'm in my senior year,

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,529
and my dad has retired.
Plus, I'm the eldest son.

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,860
Seol.
Do you really have to do this to me?

83
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,129
- Sang Cheol, keep it down.
- You stay out of this.

84
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,699
Do you have to be this mean?

85
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,500
That's none of my business.

86
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,240
- What?
- Do you expect us...

87
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,110
to do everything for you
because of your personal matters?

88
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,839
We all have personal matters.

89
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,439
I already told you last time,
and I won't change my decision.

90
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,410
- What did you just say?
- Seol is right.

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,149
Gyeong Hwan and I
also agreed to take your name out.

92
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,720
I can't believe you guys.
How dare you?

93
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,750
Gosh, this is crazy.

94
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,089
Listen.
Add my name right now.

95
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,829
You should've at least
given me the heads up!

96
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,689
- You could've called me at least!
- Stop it, seriously!

97
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,199
- I'm happy about Seol's...
- Gosh, I'm really...

98
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,930
Sang Cheol.
The professor will be here shortly.

99
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,540
Are you taking her side
because she's your girlfriend?

100
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,170
You don't care
since it won't affect your grade.

101
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,740
Good luck with the presentation.

102
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,110
Goodness.

103
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,040
Hey, add my name right now.

104
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:40,310
Goodness.
Stop yelling.

105
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,750
You guys should've at least
given me a heads up about this!

106
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,550
He's so loud.

107
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,490
- Jae Woo!
- What?

108
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,550
- Min Soo.
- Yes?

109
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
What time is it?

110
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,720
- You should have told me.
- Why?

111
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,629
It's 9:58am.

112
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,490
- Thanks.
- What are you going to do?

113
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,430
- Is it my fault?
- Be quiet already.

114
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,199
- I'm going to fail again.
- Hello, everyone.

115
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,740
What's all the noise about?

116
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,240
I could hear you
from the end of the hallway.

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,670
You must be all prepared.
I can see that you're excited.

118
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,709
Aren't you thrilled to present?
Aren't you exhilarated?

119
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,410
Yes. I'm looking forward
to your presentations too.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,579
All right.
We'll start with group one.

121
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,949
Group one, come to the front.

122
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,560
Why are there only three of you?

123
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,199
- Sang Cheol.
- Yes.

124
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:42,310
People don't change easily, do they?

125
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,740
Okay, let's start.

126
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,949
Hello. My team did a research
on organisational behaviour...

127
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,720
and transactional leadership.

128
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,689
I'm Hong Seol, and I'll be leading
my team's presentation.

129
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,920
We'll go over the concept
and conditions of being...

130
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,829
a transactional leader,
then show you images and examples.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,230
Let's define the concept first.
A transactional leader is someone...

132
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,129
who exchanges what he or she
wants with what others want.

133
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,939
This type of leadership compensates
people for their effort and...

134
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,339
promises performance-contingent rewards...

135
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,839
in order to acknowledge
their achievements.

136
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,379
According to Hellriegel
and Slocum's definition,

137
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,610
the ability
to predict future trends is one.

138
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,620
Other characteristics
include leading others while...

139
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,589
empowering them to become good leaders.

140
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,060
Now, let's look at a few examples
of transformational leadership.

141
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm Son Min Soo.

142
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Yes, Min Soo.

143
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,240
Don't stutter this time.
I hope you're well prepared.

144
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,750
Terry Fox is another example
of a transformational leader.

145
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,620
Seol, isn't that what we did?
Our presentation from last year.

146
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,149
He was a cancer research activist.

147
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,620
- I'm sure it's just similar.
- With his artificial right leg,

148
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,689
he embarked on a marathon
to raise money and awareness...

149
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,230
- for cancer research in 1980.
- It's too similar.

150
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,629
In the process
of preparing this presentation,

151
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,740
we learned that transactional
and transformational leadership are...

152
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,139
It's not just similar.
Look, it even has the same typo.

153
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
Do you remember that typo?

154
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,209
Personal gain is what motivates it.

155
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,350
In transformational leadership,
the elements of motivation...

156
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,220
are vision and value.

157
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,750
She's copying you
even in her assignment now.

158
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,590
Thank you for watching our presentation.

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,789
I didn't expect
that you'd cover the differences...

160
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,330
between transactional
and transformational leadership.

161
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,830
That was impressive.
As you just saw...

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,429
If I say something now,
it'll only complicate matters.

163
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,240
Submitting materials
to prove myself will be a hassle.

164
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,740
I might end up
upsetting other classmates too.

165
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,139
All right.
Feel free to ask questions.

166
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,840
But...

167
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,149
I don't want her
to take credit for something I did.

168
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,220
Your presentation.
Did you put it together yourself?

169
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,789
Pardon?

170
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm asking because the content
is too similar to my presentation,

171
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,029
Understanding Leadership, from last year.

172
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,230
That's impossible.

173
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,330
May I say something?

174
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,500
The comparison between
transactional leadership and...

175
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,340
transformational leadership
comes up all the time.

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,570
- I don't appreciate that question.
- That's right.

177
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,440
I don't know why you're doing this to me,

178
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,049
but I hope it's not
because of personal feelings.

179
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,850
You have no proof,
so you have no right to accuse me.

180
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,750
What did you say? It's obvious
that you plagiarised her work.

181
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,950
Over there.

182
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,120
Let's take a look at the typo.

183
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,620
That's the exact same typo I made.

184
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,730
I put it up on a website
without being aware of the typo.

185
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,759
Don't you think it's a bit too
coincidental to have the same typo?

186
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,700
You didn't even proofread it.

187
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,840
All you did was change the font
and copied and paste the contents.

188
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,700
No! I put this all together myself.

189
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
- That's Seol's presentation!
- That's enough!

190
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,549
I don't know why I have to
listen to you guys arguing.

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,720
Group three's presentation
showed the analysis very clearly,

192
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,750
and the chart at the end was great too.

193
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,919
However, if you actually copied
someone else's presentation,

194
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
it's a completely different story,
isn't it?

195
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,460
Son Min Soo.
And you two.

196
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,830
Meet me in my office after class.
Okay?

197
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,409
All right, everyone.
Good job today.

198
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,149
I don't know if all of you are happy
with how your presentations went.

199
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,980
Doing a team project isn't easy, right?

200
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,750
Because it can be challenging,
I trust that you could learn a lot.

201
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,850
We'll wrap up today's class here.

202
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

203
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:56,590
Min Soo.
What is this mess?

204
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,929
I knew that it would
turn into a mess like this.

205
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,600
But I don't care about how people
will judge me. I can no longer...

206
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,669
put up with Min Soo or Sang Cheol.

207
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,539
No, Jung helped me put it together.

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,740
Jung! Please say something.

209
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,519
You picked the topic
as well as the presentation file.

210
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,279
I didn't pick anything.
I told you about a website to refer to.

211
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,590
Plus, no sensible person would...

212
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,019
present or submit someone else's work
without changing a thing.

213
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,490
Don't you have any common sense?

214
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,299
Min Soo. How can you even think
to blame it all on Jung?

215
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,129
Gosh. I get so frustrated
whenever I'm in the same team as you.

216
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,840
Don't you know
that everyone is calling you a fake?

217
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,639
You dress like Seol,
and now you even copy her work?

218
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,809
Why would I copy Seol?

219
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,750
Stop it already.

220
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,830
Look, Seol. Are you happy that you ruined
our team's presentation?

221
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,860
You're really scary, Seol.

222
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,129
You could've talked to us after class.

223
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,299
Did you have to bring it up
in front of Professor Kang?

224
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,639
Don't you think that was too harsh?

225
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,740
Listen.
She only spoke the truth.

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,009
- Why are you blaming Seol?
- You stay out of this.

227
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,210
You were so mean to Sang Cheol too.

228
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,049
Why couldn't you just include his name?

229
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,549
Did you have to be that extreme knowing
that he'll lose the mark?

230
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,519
Goodness.
If you're that kind and thoughtful,

231
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,250
team up with him next time
and give him all the credit, okay?

232
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,820
Gosh, you're really unbelievable.

233
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,690
- Shut your mouth.
- I'm talking to Seol, not you.

234
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,629
I'm sick and tired of you.
Stop blaming others.

235
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,230
Hey, I'm so sick of
even hearing your voice, okay?

236
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,929
I hope you get a D on the presentation.

237
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,039
What? It clearly says
that it's 50 percent off.

238
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,509
Why are you asking for 50 cents more?

239
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,080
The ones on the left are on sale,
not the ones on the right.

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,580
What?

241
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
Then you should've specified it
in the discount sign.

242
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,149
Just take this and stop creating a fuss.

243
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,889
Gosh, thank you.

244
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,019
Shall we have a quick chat outside?

245
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,039
How much for this?

246
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,539
He's not stylish,
but he sure is dressed American-style.

247
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,750
- Maybe he's from a rich family.
- Pardon me?

248
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,480
I'm really grateful
for what you did earlier.

249
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,250
I want to repay your kindness.

250
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,690
Can you give me your number?

251
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,860
Well, that's not really necessary.

252
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,289
Are you a business major?

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,490
Yes. But why are you
talking to me so casually?

254
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,029
Then you must know Yu Jung.

255
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,330
I'm in the same year as him.

256
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,330
Then do you know where he is now?

257
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:51,740
I'm not that close to him,
so I wouldn't know.

258
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,070
Right! Ask that girl over there.
She's his girlfriend.

259
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,309
What? His girlfriend?

260
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,679
So...

261
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:08,049
he got a girlfriend after making me
become a mess like this?

262
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:09,750
I'll get going now.

263
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,830
Hong Seol, I can't believe
what you did to me.

264
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,129
Hey!

265
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,129
I'm so sorry! I didn't see you at all.

266
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,570
Get up.
Get up now.

267
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,940
Why are you doing this to me?

268
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,039
- I meant to grab your clothes.
- Goodness!

269
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,610
- Gosh, what's wrong with my hand?
- Stop.

270
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,809
What do you want from me?

271
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,580
I heard that you're Jung's girlfriend.

272
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,009
Pardon?

273
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
Why is Jung dating a loser like you?

274
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,320
He must have lost his mind.

275
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,450
I'm not Jung's girlfriend.

276
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,620
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not done talking!

277
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,690
It's Hong Seol.
You should be talking to her, not me.

278
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,230
Go find her if you're here
to beat up Jung's girlfriend!

279
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,029
Did I say that I'd beat you up?

280
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,700
Why are you making me look like a mobster?

281
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,740
Whatever your name is,

282
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,009
I guess you didn't know that you needed
my approval to date Jung.

283
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,549
I'm so sick of playing the same piece
over and over again.

284
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,850
- I honestly can't believe...
- I hope that today was...

285
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,549
Goodness, what is she...

286
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,450
Has Jung lost his mind?
How can he date a girl like this?

287
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,720
- Are you mad?
- What are you doing here?

288
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,929
Hey! You!

289
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,730
Listen, you! I'm going to get you.
You, red curly hair. Look at me!

290
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,830
You, curly hair!

291
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm going to come back and find you.
Brace yourself!

292
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,240
You better be prepared! In Ho! Hey!

293
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,840
Do you want to get locked up?

294
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,639
Why are you causing a scene here?

295
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,549
Jung, that jerk, is telling me
to move out of the condo!

296
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,519
That jerk is starting to get on my nerves.

297
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,850
Mr. Yu told me to listen to Jung
and gave me only 10,000 dollars.

298
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,149
- 10,000 dollars?
- Gosh.

299
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,659
That's a lot of money!

300
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,490
That's more than enough
to find a new place, you spoiled snob.

301
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,100
How can it be more than enough?
I've used up most of it already.

302
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,129
I'm going through
such a rough time right now.

303
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,740
All the brands I love are pouring out
their new collections.

304
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,740
Do you even know how it feels
not to be able to buy any of them?

305
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,169
How would I know? How in the world
could I understand you?

306
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,110
By the way, why are you here?
Are you also here to see Jung?

307
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,049
It's none of your business.

308
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,950
Gosh, I'm completely baffled.

309
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,720
Why is Jung dating that ugly girl?
Did he get hit in the head?

310
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,919
What are you talking about?

311
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,690
- You mean that girl?
- I knew it.

312
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,190
He's definitely been acting strange
these days.

313
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,259
What was her name? What a joke.

314
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,200
My purses and clothes!

315
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,830
I'm sure she's getting all of them
instead of me.

316
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,269
Gosh, I really can't allow that!

317
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:40,740
Stop! You better not
show up here ever again.

318
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,440
Why are you on the campus anyway?
Just go shopping. Get lost.

319
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,750
Gosh, how can I go shopping...

320
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,179
- when I have no money?
- Just leave.

321
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,779
Come on.

322
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,220
- Thank you, Professor.
- Take care.

323
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,559
What's going on with Min Soo?
She didn't even show up.

324
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,230
She'll get penalised.
She's getting what she deserves.

325
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,730
You said that you're meeting Jung now,
right?

326
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,529
It must be nice to see him.

327
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,309
You made it.

328
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,640
I almost forgot your face.

329
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,220
I guess you missed me.

330
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,119
Yes.

331
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,259
By the way, I'm sorry.

332
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,599
I ruined your team's presentation.

333
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,329
Don't worry.
Everyone worked hard.

334
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,670
She shouldn't have cheated like that.

335
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,339
I finally feel alive.

336
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,079
Me too.

337
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,519
We literally just met,
but we have to say goodbye now.

338
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,289
I feel lifeless again.

339
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,690
Me too.

340
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,869
But what can you do?
You have to go to work.

341
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,339
Then shall we hang out after I'm done?

342
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,000
Do you have time though?

343
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,309
Of course.

344
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,440
I'll call you.

345
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,539
I really don't want to go.

346
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,420
Hey, Hong Seol!

347
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,619
- What do you want?
- You keep ignoring my calls,

348
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,190
so I had to find you like this.

349
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,730
What do you want from me?

350
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:49,900
Just take a look at this.

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,799
You'll regret it if you don't see this.

352
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,210
Forget it.
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.

353
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,410
This!

354
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:59,710
It's related to Jung, okay?

355
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,910
I won't go on about it.

356
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,680
Just have a quick look at it, okay?

357
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,619
You should know who the real jerk is.

358
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,349
Look.
This is who Jung really is, okay?

359
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,289
I think Seol likes you.

360
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,559
Tell her how you feel about her.
What about getting her a gift?

361
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,230
You should go to the same institute
as her to see her during the break.

362
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,500
Seol likes you too.
She's just playing hard to get.

363
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,309
Hey.
Bring it back! Open this door!

364
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,640
I must check. I'm not sure
what's going on, but I need to check.

365
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,279
One, two...

366
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,579
Oh, I did it! Darn it.

367
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,720
Gosh, why do you keep calling?
Aren't you that jerk from last time?

368
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,789
Who is this? Isn't this Yu Jung's phone?

369
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Yu Jung?

370
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,599
- Who is this?
- You tell me first.

371
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,599
I asked you first, okay?

372
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,369
I can only tell you
after you tell me who you are.

373
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,339
- My name is Hong Seol.
- Open the door!

374
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,210
I'm calling to see
if this is Jung's number.

375
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,250
Hong Seol? You're Hong Seol?

376
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,220
You must be obsessed with Jung.

377
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,460
How did you get this number?

378
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,690
Do you know me?

379
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,289
Finding out who I am
will make your stomach cringe.

380
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,700
- Shell I tell you?
- Hey, open up.

381
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,869
I'm Jung's girlfriend.

382
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,970
I heard through the grapevine
that you think you're his girlfriend.

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,039
Don't be so delusional. I highly
recommend you go see a therapist.

384
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,440
Gosh! Open up.

385
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,920
I didn't know you were this strong.

386
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,250
Give it to me.
Did you call this number?

387
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,119
Did the woman pick up?
Did you talk to her?

388
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,190
Wow, I'm surprised
that she answered the call.

389
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,500
Hey! That's Yu Jung's other girlfriend,
you fool!

390
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,430
(Seol)

391
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,809
It's okay.
Get in.

392
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,390
How's it going?
Are you enjoying the internship?

393
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,660
I think I'm adjusting pretty well.

394
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,029
That's great.

395
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,160
You wanted to try it, so do your best.

396
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,130
It won't always be easy.

397
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:37,470
Working with other people...

398
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,440
will make you realise that you're not
the centre of the world.

399
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,769
I thought I was the smartest person
in the world, but...

400
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,880
I learned that this world is full of
people who are smarter than me.

401
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,779
There are lots of scary people too.

402
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,480
Not everything in the world
will go your way.

403
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,990
You should accept the fact now.
You're an adult now, right?

404
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,089
Yes.

405
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,059
It sounded a lot like In Ho's sister.

406
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,569
And she said that it was Jung's phone.

407
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,099
No.
I shouldn't trust what Yeong Gon said...

408
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,069
or what that woman said.

409
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,240
I need to ask Jung about it first.

410
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,240
Seol.

411
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,319
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I was worried.

412
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,059
What's the matter?

413
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,029
Jung.

414
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,630
Yes?

415
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,160
Last year,

416
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,470
I asked you about Yeong Gon.

417
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,670
Do you remember?

418
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,670
Yes.

419
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,839
And you're aware of...

420
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,380
what I went through last year 
because of him.

421
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,210
You know, right?

422
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,849
Yes.
I know.

423
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,819
Today, Yeong Gon...

424
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,559
showed me text messages
which are supposedly from you.

425
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:11,960
Those text messages,
did you really send it to him?

426
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,539
The person who sent those texts
saying that I like Yeong Gon...

427
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,140
Was that really you?

428
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,250
Jung.

429
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,319
Yes, I sent them.

430
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,440
Then, why did In Ho's sister
answer the phone when I called the number?

431
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,569
And...

432
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,309
she said that she's your girlfriend.

433
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,079
- How will you explain that?
- That's not true.

434
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Baek In Ha.

435
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,289
She answered the call because
she took the phone I used to use.

436
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,119
She said those things to you because...

437
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,829
she probably wanted
to give you a hard time.

438
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,859
If that's the case,
why did he give his phone to her?

439
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,200
So don't worry about what she said.

440
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,069
Then Jung did send those text messages
to Yeong Gon.

441
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:27,869
Then what about those text messages?

442
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,769
Did he give his phone to her
after sending those texts?

443
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,480
Why did you send those text messages
to Yeong Gon?

444
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,549
When I asked you last year,

445
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:39,880
you said that you just listened to him
when he was being delusional.

446
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,890
But to me, it doesn't look like
you were just listening.

447
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,019
It actually looks like
you instigated the whole thing.

448
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,559
I'm sorry.

449
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,569
I made a mistake.
It's all my fault.

450
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,369
I took it too lightly.

451
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,410
I didn't know
that it would blow up like this.

452
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,779
You didn't know?

453
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,380
You know what Yeong Gon is like.

454
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,250
Are you saying
you didn't know how he would react?

455
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,559
You really didn't know?

456
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,059
I had no idea.

457
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,960
You had no idea?

458
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:26,859
Really?

459
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,470
You really had no idea?

460
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,369
That's right.
I didn't know.

461
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,369
I'm serious.

462
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:39,509
No.
Jung clearly hated me last year,

463
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,009
and there's no way he sent those messages
with no motive.

464
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,980
What was his motive?

465
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,259
Seol. I know that you're angry.
I understand why.

466
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,460
But he misinterpreted my messages
and put you through all that.

467
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
I think that part is his fault.

468
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,470
Plus, why is he talking about
those messages from last year now?

469
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,970
He did it to tear us apart.

470
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,710
Let's not fall into his trap.

471
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,579
It's all in the past anyway.

472
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,779
Jung, you really haven't...

473
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,490
changed at all.

474
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,059
From the way you reacted
to what Mr. Heo said to now,

475
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,160
nothing has changed.

476
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,529
Is that all?

477
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,140
Did you really tell me everything?

478
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,670
Really?

479
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:49,680
What do you want me to say?

480
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,079
Jung, tell me.

481
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,049
What kind of person are you?

482
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:11,130
How long does he want me
to practise the basics?

483
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,569
It's crushing my pride.

484
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,009
Goodness.

485
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,279
What are those two doing over there?

486
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,789
Did they have an argument?

487
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,359
Gosh. Why would they argue
on a street like this?

488
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,500
I can't go this way because of them.

489
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,039
Let's...

490
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,250
give each other some time.

491
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,880
What do you mean?

492
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,750
Whenever we go through these things,

493
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,660
I don't know what to do.

494
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
I can't understand you.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,730
I want to get closer to you,

496
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,069
but it's so hard taking a step forward.

497
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:21,369
- Seol.
- This time, I hope you can...

498
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,710
really think about everything
that has happened.

499
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,140
I knew it.

500
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,039
Everyone knows how Jung is.

501
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,910
He's probably breaking Mad Hair's heart.

502
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,710
Her heart will probably
be shattered to pieces.

503
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,349
Whatever.
Who cares?

504
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,319
She got herself into this mess
in the first place.

505
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,970
But why is she...

506
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,170
Why is she with him
when all they do is fight?

507
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,279
I should really mind my own business.

508
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,289
Let me stay here for a little while, okay?

509
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,460
Because of someone, I got
kicked out of the place I was living in.

510
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,759
If you won't let me, I'll have to
move back into Mr. Yu's place.

511
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,829
Go ahead and do it
if you want my dad to estrange you.

512
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,940
He won't be thrilled when he finds out
that you spent all the money.

513
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,440
What? You knew that he gave me money
to look for a place?

514
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,069
I'm the one who told him
to give it to you.

515
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,769
I knew you'd be like this.

516
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:09,210
So, you did it so that I wouldn't try
to get more money off Mr. Yu?

517
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,049
You're using your brain for a change.

518
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,019
Hong Seol.

519
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,059
She called me today.

520
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,660
I thought the name sounded familiar.

521
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,329
She's the one you were trying
to set that idiot up with, right?

522
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,170
Gosh, I thought she was your girlfriend
or something like that...

523
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,769
and got all tense for a moment.

524
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,240
What are you plotting now?

525
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,670
Tell me whenever you want to
get that clingy girl out of your life.

526
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,579
It'll be a piece of cake for me.

527
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,410
If you let me live in the condo again,
I'll also...

528
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,349
Why are you taking the phone away from me?

529
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,490
Do you still not get it?

530
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,890
Who is the clingy one that I can't stand?

531
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,660
Who? Who...

532
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,329
Me? Are you saying
that I'm clinging to you?

533
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,960
If you know, keep your mouth shut
and behave yourself.

534
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,230
I don't want to.

535
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,069
Let me show you what being clingy means.

536
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,200
You won't be able
to get rid of me that easily.

537
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,769
Okay.

538
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,710
Then do whatever you want.

539
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,450
Just know that...

540
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,289
I'm doing my best not to get angry at you
for what you did today.

541
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,359
It'd be wise to stay away from me.

542
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,099
Hey!

543
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,900
Hey!

544
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,670
Open the darn door!
What did I do to deserve this?

545
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,769
Is she really your girlfriend?

546
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,779
Hey, stop! Come back here!

547
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,849
Gosh, what am I going to do?
He got in the elevator!

548
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,450
Tell her how you feel about her.
What about getting her a gift?

549
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,660
You should go to the same institute as her
to see her during the break.

550
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:03,230
You know that girls play hard to get
even if they like the guy, right?

551
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,960
Seol likes you too.
She's just not showing it.

552
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,769
You two would make a very cute couple,
so keep hitting on her.

553
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:30,250
Was I right about Jung last year?

554
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,660
Am I being fooled?

555
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:40,160
Even if I am,
will I be able to break up with Jung?

556
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,470
I need to focus.

557
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,670
Focus, Hong Seol.

558
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,980
(I miss you...)

559
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,250
(I hope you'll have a good day...)

560
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,329
Good luck with the exam.

561
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:54,200
Hey, Seol.
Are you going to school this early?

562
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:57,009
Oh, hi. Yes.
I have an exam today.

563
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,079
Why are you here?

564
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
You're not the only one.

565
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,349
I have a lesson too.
Let's go together.

566
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:05,680
I see.

567
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:07,980
By the way, why do you look so haggard?

568
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,250
Did you always look like this?

569
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,360
Yes.
This is what I look like.

570
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,199
Drink this.

571
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:23,030
This should help alleviate
the anger you have towards your boyfriend.

572
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,639
How did you know?

573
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:29,969
Did you see us?

574
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,869
Did the two of you really argue?

575
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,480
Gosh, I should become a fortune teller.

576
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,480
I already told you.

577
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:42,989
He makes all his girlfriends cry.

578
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,789
So what did you fight about?

579
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
You know that I know him very well.
I can give you advice...

580
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,960
Gosh, I know exactly what you'd say.

581
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,760
You'll just badmouth Jung.

582
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,929
Right.

583
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,570
I don't have anything good
to say about him.

584
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,070
See? Look at you.
I knew it.

585
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,210
I'll take this.
Thanks.

586
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,980
Why is she talking so casually to me?
Hey, don't drink it.

587
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,780
- I spat in it.
- Gosh, this is delicious.

588
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,079
Give it back to me!

589
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,150
You should be grateful for me.

590
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,690
Hong Seol is here.
Seol.

591
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,059
Seol.
Good luck with the exam.

592
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,690
It's so awkward.

593
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,000
Did you break up with Jung?

594
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,590
I told you. I'm the only one
who sincerely cares about you.

595
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,570
- Min Soo.
- Yes?

596
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,769
You haven't apologised to Seol
about the presentation yet, right?

597
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,039
Why should I?

598
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,110
I know I copied her work,
but she doesn't deserve an apology.

599
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,550
Goodness, Min Soo.

600
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,920
This is why things never work out for you.

601
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:24,050
Let me give you some advice.

602
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,559
What are you doing now?

603
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,099
Well...

604
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,929
I tried playing something else
for a change.

605
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:44,440
Fine, I get it.
I'll practise it over and over again.

606
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,079
Fine, then.

607
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:54,250
I was going to give you
another piece to practise.

608
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,690
I'll practise this.
I'll do my best.

609
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,659
- I really will.
- Keep practising the basics.

610
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,159
What's this? This is "Fur Elise"...

611
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,539
I want to play something more challenging.

612
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,570
It's such a fun piece.
Give it back to me if you don't want it.

613
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,340
Wait, I'll do it.

614
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,579
That grumpy old man is so impatient.

615
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,980
I'll start practising it now.

616
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,219
- It's done!
- Gosh, the exam is finally over.

617
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,130
- Seriously.
- It's finally done.

618
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,329
Did you do well?

619
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,300
Don't ask me that kind of question.

620
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:41,929
How was it for you?

621
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,170
- I don't know.
- I'm sure you did well.

622
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,699
Hey, Seol.

623
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:51,010
I want to talk to you
about my presentation.

624
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,980
I want to apologise to you.

625
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,079
I'm sorry.

626
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,750
I didn't mean to copy your work.

627
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,980
You'll accept my apology, right?

628
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:10,929
Well, are you sorry about anything else?

629
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,230
What do you mean by that?
What else did I do?

630
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:17,969
What is wrong with her?

631
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,139
I apologised to her. Why does she have to
hold a grudge like that?

632
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,070
Seol. You were harsh enough to her
on the day of the presentation.

633
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,940
You're really weird.

634
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
Totally. It's also ridiculous
that she thinks Min Soo is copying her.

635
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,380
I know. Her style of clothes
is all over the internet.

636
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:34,380
Yes! I admit
that I did copy her presentation,

637
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,150
- but my clothes are really...
- Yes. Don't worry.

638
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,889
Don't even apologise to her.

639
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,460
You girls are being ridiculous.

640
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,559
Listen. Pretending to be sorry like that
isn't an apology!

641
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,260
- Gosh, Bo Ra. Stop it.
- Have some shame.

642
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,460
- How dare you?
- Is she yelling at me right now?

643
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,869
Stop getting involved
in other people's business!

644
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,570
- Let go of me!
- They're like two peas in a pod.

645
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,170
You, fools.
Get a taste of this!

646
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,440
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

647
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,309
Hey, what shall we eat?

648
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,039
Sorry, I have plans for lunch.
Eat with your friend. Bye!

649
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,340
- What plans?
- Sorry, Da Young!

650
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,380
Hey!

651
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,880
Gosh, I'm so annoyed right now.

652
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,480
I'm jealous that you have a boyfriend.

653
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,119
You have a boyfriend too.

654
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:13,460
He's quite good-looking.
Is he younger than you?

655
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,760
- What?
- Just tell me. I saw it.

656
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:20,030
The wallpaper on your phone.
Isn't he your boyfriend?

657
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,030
Right, that photo...

658
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,130
Yes, he is.

659
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:29,340
Really? Good for you!
You have a boyfriend now? Who is he?

660
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,469
How old is he?

661
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,480
Well, he's younger than me,

662
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,539
and he's very handsome and cute.

663
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:38,380
He tells me
that he's totally in love with me.

664
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,750
He's so good to me.

665
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,980
- Min Soo, show us his photo.
- I'll show it to you later.

666
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,059
You don't want other girls
to know how cute he is?

667
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,960
Are you already trying to control him?

668
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,460
No, that's not it.

669
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,030
- I'm so jealous.
- Gosh, I'm hungry.

670
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,699
- What do you feel like eating?
- What shall we eat?

671
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,869
Well, I can't really say that I lied.

672
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:02,570
I could end up going out with him.

673
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:09,880
Listen. If you're bored,
help your parents at their restaurant...

674
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,309
instead of coming to my school.

675
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,150
Why? Don't you like me visiting you here?

676
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:18,389
Well, I have to study for my exam,
but I can't focus because of you.

677
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:19,559
Go now.

678
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,559
Hey, Ah Young.

679
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,230
Shall I...

680
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,360
quit my school in the States
and transfer here?

681
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,769
Then we can go to the same school
like when we were in high school.

682
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,739
Joon. Weren't you so excited
about going to school abroad?

683
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,369
Well, that was...

684
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:39,010
I just thought that it'd help me find
what I want to do.

685
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:41,880
But it's not fun at all.

686
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,309
Plus, I keep thinking about
this person in Korea.

687
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,190
Kumquat, I thought about you so much
when I was feeling lonely there.

688
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:54,260
Stop calling me Kumquat!
Why are you calling me that?

689
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,090
You look like a kumquat.
What else can I call you then?

690
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,900
You haven't grown much ever since.

691
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,400
Plus, don't you think
it's a cute nickname?

692
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,269
- Whatever.
- I should call Seol.

693
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,739
I'll ask her to buy us food.
No, no. Let's call Jung...

694
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,670
and plan a double date.

695
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,780
Joon. Just go home if you're going to
keep talking nonsense.

696
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:15,440
I'm going to go to the library to study.

697
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,280
- Why?
- You keep disturbing me.

698
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:19,980
Where am I supposed to go, then?
Just stay here.

699
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,150
- I don't want to! Go now.
- Just study here, okay?

700
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,199
Gosh, Seol.

701
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,469
She's actually quite pretty looking
at her from this angle.

702
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:48,739
She has a small face.

703
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,579
Gosh, she's actually very stylish.

704
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,780
Why didn't I notice it sooner?

705
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,119
Gosh, you startled me.

706
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,219
- What are you doing now?
- Was this yours?

707
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,789
It was on the floor.
I didn't know whose it was.

708
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,630
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me!

709
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,230
Seol.
I thought about it and...

710
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,969
Seol, listen to me.
Stop!

711
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:48,300
Stop and listen to me.
Wait, I want to talk to you.

712
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,769
- Gosh, seriously...
- Goodness! Let go of me!

713
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,739
You're too much.
I told you everything.

714
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,710
You now know what kind of jerk Jung is.

715
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,579
You know the truth now, right?

716
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,849
- Send this to me after, okay?
- You think it's you?

717
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,090
- Yes.
- Stop being so delusional.

718
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,960
I've changed a lot.
I've gotten quite popular in school,

719
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:08,789
and my family is well off too.

720
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,000
Aren't I good enough to be your boyfriend?

721
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,199
What's that now?

722
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,599
I'm going to break up
with Da Young soon too.

723
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,670
I was just using her anyway
to make everyone like me.

724
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,969
I'll break up with her as soon as
you make up your mind...

725
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:24,110
What are you two doing?

726
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,110
- What are you doing here?
- You're beyond ridiculous.

727
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:29,280
I'm actually beginning to pity you.

728
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:30,980
- What?
- You're such a loser.

729
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,719
I've never seen a loser like you
in my entire life.

730
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,750
- Great. We're almost there.
- Did you just call me a loser?

731
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,920
- He's going up to her.
- Just hug her now.

732
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,289
You, witch.

733
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:46,329
- Just wait.
- That rat...

734
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,059
We're almost there.
Keep quiet.

735
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,329
You want to get a hug from me, don't you?

736
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,929
Okay.
I'll hug you.

737
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,969
- Come here, Seol.
- That rat...

738
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,440
- Gosh...
- Come here.

739
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:58,070
- Come here, you pervert!
- Gosh, why is he here?

740
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,039
Stop right there, you rat!

741
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:02,579
Gosh, stop following me!

742
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,480
Did you record everything?

743
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,349
- What was that jerk doing?
- You ruined everything!

744
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,949
Goodness.
Let me see.

745
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,389
Gosh, it's that guy's fault.
He ruined it all.

746
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:13,659
What did I do?

747
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,860
You've lost your mind.
You're crazy.

748
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,230
Going through all those things
must've made you become gutsy.

749
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,000
Stop it already.
We're inside the library now.

750
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,039
What? Evidence? Let me do this.

751
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,369
You frustrate me so much.

752
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:30,670
A rat like him needs
to be beaten up, okay?

753
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,110
Gosh, seriously.
You're being so noisy.

754
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,579
And after I'm done here,

755
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,380
I have to go and study for my exam.

756
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,480
You should go home without me.

757
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,949
No, I don't want to do that.
It's dangerous at night.

758
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,389
That lunatic can show up anytime.

759
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,659
You know what?
You should learn self-defence from me.

760
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,690
You're too weak.

761
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,460
Right, you need a weapon.
I'll buy you pepper spray.

762
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,570
If anything happens,
I'll use this book as my weapon.

763
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,239
I don't need a special weapon.

764
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,570
You can't defend yourself with a book.

765
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,210
Let's just go back home together
all the time.

766
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,949
That will make me feel better.

767
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,889
Gosh.
What are you doing now?

768
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,159
I've been thinking.

769
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:23,159
How about you take the qualification exam
for university entrance?

770
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,460
What?

771
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:28,000
Study for the qualification exam
and get into university.

772
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,400
Then you can study music too.

773
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:32,969
Forget it.

774
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:37,409
I never studied even as a kid.
I'm not taking that exam.

775
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,550
What's wrong?

776
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,360
Your sister.

777
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,019
Was she really close to Jung?

778
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,400
Listen.
Why do you keep bringing up this topic?

779
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,469
You're weird.

780
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:08,840
Well, I was just curious.
It looks like they still talk.

781
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,369
That's all.
There's nothing more.

782
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:16,250
They're not going out at all,
so don't even worry.

783
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,849
Sometimes in life,

784
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,380
you meet enemies
whom you just can't be separated from.

785
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,849
That's how life is.

786
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:27,059
Okay.

787
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,789
By the way, anyone would know
that you two are siblings.

788
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,199
The two of you resemble each other.

789
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,469
She's pretty,

790
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,170
- but she has such a foul mouth...
- We don't look anything alike.

791
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,969
How am I like my sister?

792
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,940
That's such a harsh thing to say.

793
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,269
She's such a scary person.

794
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,510
I'm telling you this just in case.
If you ever bump into my sister,

795
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,980
just run.

796
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,579
If the situation doesn't allow you
to run for whatever reason,

797
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:54,980
then grab her hair.

798
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,489
When you fight, you must intimidate
your opponent from the get-go.

799
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,159
You have to do as I say.
If not, you might actually die.

800
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,260
Gosh, that won't happen.

801
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,559
Right, it shouldn't.

802
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:15,670
Why?

803
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,679
What is it? Where are you?

804
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,179
What's going on now? Goodness.

805
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:35,019
Hi, In Ho.
I have nowhere to go.

806
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:38,289
- So?
- Could you carry my suitcase...

807
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,360
and take me to your place?

808
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,429
Let's go now.
I'm hungry.

809
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,239
Where are you going?

810
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,710
That heartless jerk.

811
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,409
He lives in such a shabby building.

812
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,449
Have some instant noodles.

813
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,050
Why does your place smell like this?

814
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,460
Which room do I use?

815
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,360
Is this the bathroom?

816
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,159
There are no cockroaches, right?

817
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,269
How am I going to live here?

818
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,539
You're being so ridiculous.

819
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,170
There are no bugs, right?

820
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,079
Why are you so calm?

821
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:28,340
This isn't like you.

822
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,480
In life, you need to know...

823
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:34,280
when to be vocal and when to lay low
in order to live off other people.

824
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,849
But it doesn't mean that I'm not angry!

825
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,320
You haven't changed one bit.

826
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,460
Oh? What are these?

827
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,559
Hey, don't touch them!

828
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:47,960
Did you start playing the piano again?

829
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,699
- Goodness!
- Hey!

830
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:58,309
Oh, no! It slipped off my hands.

831
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:01,340
- You must be out of your mind.
- I can't eat the noodles you made.

832
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
I'm sorry.

833
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,079
Can you make the noodles again for me?
I want jajangmyeon noodles.

834
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,579
Know your place, Baek In Ho.

835
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,489
You probably still think you're a genius.

836
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,559
Do you still dream
of becoming a world-famous pianist?

837
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,670
You're not going
to freeload here forever, right?

838
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,170
How did you end up like this?

839
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,579
I know, right? How did I become like this?

840
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,380
I miss the old days.

841
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,590
Hey, let's go skiing.

842
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,719
You wish.
Did you memorise all of this?

843
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,559
- No.
- Then memorise it now.

844
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,760
Let's go! Let's not do this boring stuff.

845
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,190
Jung!

846
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,170
What should we do?
I lost your fountain pen.

847
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,670
Gosh, well do you want
to hold onto the lid?

848
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,469
Hey, that was a bit harsh.

849
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,780
It's okay.
There's nothing we can do.

850
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,380
Jung, how is this okay?

851
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,579
Isn't this important to you?
You got it as a gift.

852
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,090
- You need to pay him for this.
- Jung is okay with it.

853
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,889
Who are you to cause trouble about it?

854
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,860
You're the one who's causing trouble,
you jerk.

855
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,420
Are you crazy?

856
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,829
Have you become that cocky
because of your rich friend here?

857
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,659
Why are you two so cocky, then?

858
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,570
Do you have gangster friends
who have your back?

859
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:34,570
Gosh. Who knew that gangsters
could attend our school?

860
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,769
That's enough.
Stop it.

861
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,010
He's saying that he lost it.
There's nothing we can do.

862
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:41,579
You heard that, right?
Know your place, you jerk.

863
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,579
I'm going now.

864
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,349
Why do you put up with that?

865
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,860
Are you going to be a pushover forever?

866
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,829
You know he's lying.

867
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,829
He's probably going to sell it online.

868
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,199
- Doesn't it make you angry?
- It's just better this way.

869
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,329
It'd be weird
to fight over a fountain pen.

870
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:08,139
What's weird about it?
It's not weird at all.

871
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,070
Those jerks are the weird ones.

872
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,179
- Really?
- Of course.

873
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:16,949
If something like this happens ever again,
just hit them.

874
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,679
I can explain it to Mr. Yu for you.
Got it?

875
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
- Are you telling me to fight?
- Yes, you fool.

876
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,389
I know that you can beat them
all up easily if you want to.

877
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:28,760
Look at your build.
You're wasting your talent, seriously.

878
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,659
Just hit them! Don't hesitate.

879
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:33,400
Goodness.

880
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,769
What was that?

881
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,369
You said I should hit people.

882
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,769
- Yes, but why are you...
- You told me to do it.

883
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,769
I see.
This is how I should do it.

884
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,110
Don't hit your friend!
Hit those jerks, you fool.

885
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,690
- Wow.
- Gosh, it's beautiful.

886
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,360
- Hey, open your mouth.
- Gosh, don't even try.

887
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:03,460
Did you skip
the tutoring session for this?

888
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:06,059
Jung! What took you so long?

889
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,929
What are you going to do
if my dad finds out?

890
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,030
Gosh.
You're so boring.

891
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,570
We're on vacation.

892
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:14,469
No one will scold us
for having a bit of fun after studying.

893
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,300
I'm jealous of you two.

894
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,969
You're allowed to do whatever you want.

895
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,210
Jung, you should live freely too.

896
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,380
Life is short.
It'll light up and vanish like fireworks.

897
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:29,280
Have some fun.
Look at her. She is so carefree.

898
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,719
- She's too carefree.
- Watch your tongue!

899
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,690
Hey.

900
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,460
What do you think
we'd be doing 10 years from now?

901
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,300
Well, I'd still be playing the piano.

902
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,530
You'll inherit your dad's company.

903
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,570
We'll skip our work
and have fun like this.

904
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,099
In Ha is the problem.

905
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,769
I see no future for her.
None at all.

906
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:52,570
Why are you asking this anyway?

907
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,579
We don't even know what tomorrow
will bring. A decade is a long time.

908
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,150
No matter what we end up doing,
I'm sure we'd still be friends.

909
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,219
Jung, I'm sure
you have a lot of stress too.

910
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,789
You should let it out.
Hey, let's light those up too.

911
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:10,130
Everything will be in a much better place.
Right, Jung?

912
00:54:26,739 --> 00:54:28,599
I can't understand you.

913
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,340
I want to get closer to you,

914
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,539
but it's hard to take a step towards you.

915
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,710
Let's...

916
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,750
give each other some space.

917
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,829
In the beginning,
I thought you were just like me.

918
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,159
That's why I started liking you.

919
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,000
But we're very different.

920
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:13,949
You make my heart bounce,
my heart is fluttering

921
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,150
I'm scared that you might find out

922
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,150
Is she high or something?

923
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,820
You make my heart bounce, bounce

924
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,690
- Bounce, bounce.
- Hey, something is fishy.

925
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,829
Did something good
happen to you overnight?

926
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,199
Just get lost if you're going out anyway.

927
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,500
I'm in a good mood for a change,
so don't ruin it.

928
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,239
Don't do anything stupid.
You better not skip the classes.

929
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,539
That data entry and bookkeeping.
You need to get that certificate...

930
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,039
to be able to earn a living yourself.

931
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,909
Gosh, just shut it and go away!

932
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:45,050
Goodness.

933
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,550
Clean up after you finish eating!

934
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:52,989
You're a real piece of work.

935
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,789
Darn it. Did he figure out
that I made a deal with Jung?

936
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:01,530
He's like a ghost sometimes.

937
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:02,800
He's quick-witted.

938
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,530
That's a skill he picked up
from his tough childhood.

939
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Let's look at my phone.

940
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,070
Jung.
Today, I'll carry out...

941
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,940
the first step of the plan.

942
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,849
Expensive clothes.

943
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,280
How much for this?

944
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,449
Surprise!

945
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,920
I told you
that I would repay your kindness.

946
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,460
I don't like owing people anything.

947
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,099
- Well...
- Why? Are you disappointed?

948
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,429
Shall we go and eat something delicious?

949
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:39,199
No, it's okay.

950
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,070
Why? You don't want
to buy me delicious food?

951
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:45,340
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Let's go!

952
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,610
Thank you.

953
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,809
You must know Yeong Gon
if you're in Business Administration.

954
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,550
You asked about Yu Jung last time.

955
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,920
It sounds like you know
many guys in my department.

956
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:01,559
I heard about him from a friend
and I'm interested.

957
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,829
Yeong Gon has a girlfriend.

958
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,030
He has a girlfriend?

959
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,530
Where can I find them?
Are you good friends with him?

960
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,699
- Where should I go to...
- I'm not really friends with him.

961
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:15,340
I see, you guys aren't close.
But I'm sure you have an idea.

962
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,840
- Do you know what restaurant he...
- Can we stop talking about him?

963
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,039
I'll give this back to you.

964
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,079
- Gosh, my stomach is upset now.
- Hey.

965
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,010
Hey.
Where are you going? Tell me where he is.

966
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,519
Are you not going to focus?
This will be on the exam tomorrow.

967
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:35,090
Okay.
I'll study.

968
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,530
I wonder who's this from?

969
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,900
It's been a long time.

970
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:44,969
Who is this?

971
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,269
Do you remember me?
I'm Yu Jung's girlfriend.

972
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:49,539
What is this now?

973
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,369
Hong Seol is his girlfriend.

974
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,550
Gosh, I'm his real girlfriend.

975
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,710
Have you forgotten
talking to me on Jung's phone?

976
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,449
My goodness.

977
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,849
Listen. Are you going to keep making me
be suspicious of you?

978
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,820
Don't make me doubt you.
Show me now.

979
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:10,630
Women shouldn't be nosy about what men do.

980
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,989
Shut it. Just give it to me.
What is it?

981
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:15,329
What does my Da Young want from me?

982
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,630
- Show me your phone.
- Why are you doing this?

983
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,170
You're still such a loser.

984
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:24,110
Well, this is just the first step,
so I'll leave it at this.

985
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,539
Yu Jung.

986
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,510
You'll be in for a surprise.

987
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,679
Why? Because I'm Baek In Ha.

988
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,449
Seol! Come and sit here.

989
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:41,820
Let's sit here.

990
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,630
Why do you want to sit at the front?

991
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,429
Gosh, just go in.
Hurry up.

992
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:46,730
Just go in.
You're so slow.

993
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:49,730
Why am I slow?
Gosh, I don't like sitting at the front.

994
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,400
Jung, what's going on with Seol?

995
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,639
You two had a fight, right?

996
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,739
No, we didn't.

997
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,309
Gosh, did you two break up already?

998
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,840
Who would want to date
a difficult person like her?

999
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,079
Jung is just too understanding.

1000
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:04,849
Seol. Did something happen
between you and Jung?

1001
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,650
- No.
- Shush.

1002
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:09,250
- It looks like something happened.
- Be quiet.

1003
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,150
- Do you know what happened?
- You're so slow.

1004
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,619
I'm going to get coffee.
Do you want anything?

1005
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:19,090
No.
I'm going to ace the exam.

1006
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:34,409
I really need to focus.

1007
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,809
How could he ignore me like that?

1008
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,800
I already had too much coffee.

1009
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,340
Min Soo. If you have something to say,
just say it.

1010
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,900
Why are you so paranoid?

1011
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,809
Stop lying!
When will you stop bothering me?

1012
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,210
You're the one who started it.

1013
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:16,639
Wait. Are you Hong Seol?
Are you Jung's girlfriend?

1014
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,110
Did you approach her to make Jung mad?

1015
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,920
- Do you like her?
- Hey!

1016
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,650
- Your face is...
- Gosh, don't do that.

1017
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,619
Your face is really red right now.

1018
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:28,489
I won't rush you.
If you can try to understand me,

1019
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:31,130
I can keep waiting for you.
I just want you to come back.

1020
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:33,389
Yeong Gon was a total lunatic last year.

1021
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:36,599
This year, he's gotten
even more aggressive.

1022
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,829
- But what will you do with this?
- Baek In Ho?

1023
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,039
I'm trying
to get rid of that loser for you.

1024
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:44,039
Look forward to it.

1025
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,739
- Did you guys make up?
- I think I can...

1026
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,539
understand Jung a bit more now.

1027
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,449
This crazy girl
is Yu Jung's real girlfriend!

1028
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:54,980
So you're going to stay there
while I try to get closer to you?

1029
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:57,449
Will that resolve everything?
