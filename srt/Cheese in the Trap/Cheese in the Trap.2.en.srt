1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,309
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,910
You should have been more careful.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,779
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,989
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,829
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,059
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,660
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,199
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:40,109
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,679
Let's begin the class now.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,320
Management...

12
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,090
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,689
What?

14
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,060
Hold on, are you in this class...

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,299
Your name isn't here though.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,899
I switched. I thought your class
would be more fun.

17
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,400
Is that right?

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,099
I'm happy to see you here.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,310
Smart students love my classes.

20
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,409
All right. Shall we begin now?

21
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,409
- Conflict management.
- Seol.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's look at page 12.

23
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,780
Hi, Seol.

24
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,189
What does he want from me?

25
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,230
What does he want me to do?

26
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's wrap up the class here.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
Well, don't forget about the quiz
before the midterm exam.

28
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,799
The final exam will be replaced
with the group presentation.

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,510
Also, the 10-page paper
on business strategy theories...

30
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,769
is due next week.

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,109
Listen. Why are you guys
always complaining?

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,650
I don't get it. Think about your
tuition fees. How much did you pay?

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,420
Your tuition is 10 times more
than what I used to pay.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,019
It's gotten so expensive. Do you
want to throw your money away?

35
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,090
I can confidently say that my course
is worth about one million dollars.

36
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,359
Listen. I've devoted my life
to studying hard to become...

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,730
an expert in this field, and I'm
offering all of my knowledge to you.

38
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,069
Your job is just to sit there and
absorb everything I teach you.

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,240
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

40
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,639
Okay, then. I'll see you all
in the next class.

41
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,009
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,509
Seol, what are you doing
for lunch...

43
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,090
(Episode 2)

44
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,289
Seol.

45
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:36,860
Do you want to go for lunch with me?

46
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,500
No, I'm meeting someone.

47
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,000
What's he doing?
Why is he following me?

48
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,310
He's flaunting
his long legs, isn't he?

49
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,009
Jung, why are you doing this...

50
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,020
I was already weirded out by him,

51
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,819
but he started acting
even more strangely.

52
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,900
- Hi.
- Hello.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,729
Ever since the semester started,
he's been following me around.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
In the past, he used to ignore me
when I said hi to him,

55
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,569
but he's been smiling and acting
all friendly towards me these days.

56
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,509
He shows up out of nowhere at
mealtimes and goes,

57
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,740
"Have you eaten lunch yet?"

58
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,650
Yes. Of course, I did.
It's past lunchtime.

59
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,719
It's only 11:30am though.
You already ate lunch?

60
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:39,490
I was just really hungry today.
I'm so full now.

61
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,300
No matter how hard
I try to avoid him...

62
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:54,969
I'm convinced.
He's doing this on purpose.

63
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,009
- Are you hurt? Let me see.
- No, I'm okay.

64
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,909
- Are you really okay?
- I said I'm okay!

65
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,409
I can't take this any more.

66
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,520
Jung. Spare me a second.

67
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,860
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,300
I've said this to you before, but...

69
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,199
I'm really sorry about the incident
with my course cancellation.

70
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,439
I... I jumped to conclusions
and caused you trouble.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,110
Please forgive me.

72
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,310
I don't think I can.

73
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,949
Why not?

74
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,019
I'm earnestly and sincerely
apologising to you right now.

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Well... Shouldn't apologies...

76
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,759
satisfy the wronged party?

77
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,790
Right.

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,829
Then, how should I apologise
to satisfy you?

79
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,870
Let's go for food together.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,500
Why is he so obsessed with
eating with me?

81
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,910
It's 5pm now,
so we should go for dinner.

82
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,240
You're not working
after this today anyway.

83
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,509
How does he know my work schedule?

84
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,110
You're not thinking that you don't
want to eat with me, are you?

85
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,850
Fine, I'll eat with you.

86
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,319
Of course not.

87
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,420
If it's your wish, I'll
eat with you this one time.

88
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,790
Shall we go?

89
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,589
We should go this way.

90
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,170
Thank you.
Thank you for getting these.

91
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,600
I wanted to treat you
to something nicer.

92
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,810
Gosh, no. This is great.

93
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,519
Well, I've never bought food
at convenience stores.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,319
Eat this one.

95
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,360
Thanks.

96
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,000
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

97
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,300
He's sly like a snake and...

98
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,439
Right.

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,899
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,610
He's sly and...

101
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,980
- Pardon?
- I've been...

102
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,779
bugging you too much about
eating with me, haven't I?

103
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,910
I just wanted a chance
to talk to you.

104
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,689
I understand why you were suspicious
of me for the course cancellation.

105
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,860
Come to your senses, seriously.
This guy is sly like a snake...

106
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,360
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

107
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,100
He's sly... Is he sly?

108
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,199
Is he not?

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,730
To be honest, I shouldn't have
been suspicious of you like that.

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,899
I should have actually paid
for all these too.

111
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,310
I know, right?
Do you really mean it?

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,310
Then stop feeling bad about it
and treat me to dinner next time.

113
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,250
What?

114
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,410
Let's go for something
more delicious next time.

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,019
Sure.

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,420
I'll treat you.

117
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,560
I wasn't wrong. This guy is so sly,
just like a snake.

118
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,100
Which way are you going?

119
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,000
What about you?

120
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,009
I'm going to go to the library.

121
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,740
I see. I have to go to...
the Business Building.

122
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,110
Thank you for the food.

123
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,920
Seol? Is that you, Seol?

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,420
- Ah Young!
- Gosh, Seol!

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,420
How long has it been?

126
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,790
I've been meaning to
get in touch with you.

127
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,060
How's school going?
Are you enjoying it?

128
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,660
Yes, I'm loving it.

129
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,660
I love going to the same
school as you.

130
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,800
Look at you.
You're such a sweetie.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Seol. By the way,
your friend over there...

132
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,370
Right.

133
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,709
He's in his senior year
in my department.

134
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,910
I see. Hello, I'm Kang Ah Young.

135
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,110
I'm Seol's close friend.

136
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,680
- Nice to meet you.
- Goodness.

137
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
You're very handsome.

138
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,920
Well, thanks.

139
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,990
I should be the one thanking...

140
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,889
Jung. I'll see you later.

141
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,389
Bye! I hope to see you around...

142
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,569
Seol.
Are you close friends with him?

143
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,899
No, I'm not. Not at all.

144
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,470
Right. What's his name?

145
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,209
Kang Ah Young.

146
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,910
You must be careful
with guys, okay?

147
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,509
Just because they look like nice
guys doesn't mean they actually are.

148
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,220
There are guys with dark agenda
who you can't read or figure out.

149
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,019
Are you saying that friend of
yours is like that?

150
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,789
No. That's not what I meant to say.

151
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,190
I just want you, my sweetie,

152
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,259
to be more careful with guys
when it comes to dating.

153
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,759
So what type of guy should I go for?

154
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,470
So this is Yonyi University
where that jerk, Jung, goes to.

155
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,340
I wonder what he's been up to.

156
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,409
Why is this campus
so darn humongous?

157
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,649
Who are you? Are you a student here?

158
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,289
Where's the Department of
Business Administration?

159
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,590
Follow me.

160
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,759
You want me to follow you...

161
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,470
Who is he? Is he a professor?
Is he a student here?

162
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,610
Seol. Seol.

163
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,809
Do you want to go for food?

164
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,009
Do you want to eat with me?

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,450
Seol!

166
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,590
Seol.

167
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,600
Now he's even showing up
in my dreams.

168
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,870
If I print it out now,
I'll make it just in time.

169
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,009
What was that?

170
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,490
You.

171
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:19,490
Come here.

172
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,799
How rude...

173
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,129
Why are you ignoring me now?

174
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,769
- Me?
- Yes, you.

175
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,909
Where's the Department of
Business Administration?

176
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,909
- I don't know.
- Don't lie. You go to this school.

177
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,580
Just share it with
that man over there.

178
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm busy, so I have to go now.

179
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,519
- Where do you think you're going?
- You! Over there!

180
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,860
- Hey...
- Stop!

181
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,789
- Come. Let's go now.
- Stop right there!

182
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,360
- What's going on now?
- Bring this. Come quickly!

183
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
Stop right there!

184
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,600
You two! Stop!

185
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,769
Stop right there!

186
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,210
- Seriously! Stop now!
- Ouch...

187
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,779
You two! Stop there!

188
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,850
- Come here.
- Stop!

189
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,289
Where did you two go?

190
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,759
Where did they go?

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,870
We're okay now. He's gone.

192
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,409
What was that about?
Gosh, it stinks.

193
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:43,610
Have some water.

194
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,840
You did a good job.

195
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,919
Goodness. He probably thought
I was a beggar too.

196
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,320
- Do you have some money?
- Sorry?

197
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,389
Do you have money?

198
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,789
No, I don't.
You're being ridiculous.

199
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,220
Give me a one-dollar bill.

200
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:08,200
- Here. Take this and go away.
- Hang on. What's that?

201
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,500
- What's what?
- I'd prefer that 10-dollar bill.

202
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,899
Stop being so ridiculous.
I can't give this to you.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,009
- I'll call the security. Mr. Kim!
- Gosh! Stop it.

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,110
Fine.

205
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,279
You're unbelievable.

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,679
Give me that one-dollar bill too.

207
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,309
Fine. Leave me alone now.

208
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,019
- This is crazy.
- Don't worry. I'll go now.

209
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,720
- Just go.
- I'll see you around.

210
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,350
Thanks.

211
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,389
Gosh, go away now. Seriously.

212
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,090
I need help with my buggy.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,659
- I hope to see you again.
- Sure.

214
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,370
Goodness. Darn it.

215
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,500
That girl thought I was a beggar.

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,210
Where did this girl go?

217
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,309
I couldn't print my paper
because of that jerk...

218
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,090
What?

219
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,990
What's wrong with this now?

220
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,629
I only saved the file on my laptop.
I have to type it all out again.

221
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,600
Did you bring your laptop
by any chance?

222
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,470
I didn't bring my laptop today.
Sorry.

223
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,009
Excuse me. Could I borrow
your laptop for a few minutes?

224
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,309
I need my laptop to take notes.
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,379
I can't lend you mine.

226
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:41,389
Do you want to use mine?

227
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,889
Sorry?

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,230
Thank you.

229
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,500
Hello.

230
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,970
- Hello.
- Hello.

231
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,570
What a beautiful spring day!

232
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,279
I can see that you're all feeling
drowsy after lunch.

233
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:03,580
All right. Open your eyes, everyone.
This will be a very important class.

234
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:10,490
Let's talk about business
strategies. Directional strategy...

235
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,019
and non-directional strategy.
These are the two main categories.

236
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,990
There's one thing I've always been
emphasising to you.

237
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,289
What is a strategy?

238
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,730
What is it?

239
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,899
Goodness. I'm speechless.

240
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,309
When I teach you something,
do you think that writing it down...

241
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,639
and thoughtlessly memorising it
is all you have to do?

242
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,980
Can you remember anything that way?
Look now. You can't even say a word.

243
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,279
Even as I'm talking to you
like this now,

244
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,120
I see that some of you aren't
even paying attention.

245
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,019
You. You, right there!

246
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,120
Excuse me, Professor Kang.
May I ask you a question?

247
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,860
Sure, Jung. Go ahead.

248
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,590
I've heard about the five steps
of strategic planning,

249
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,690
known as "The Five Boxes".

250
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,559
The concept isn't included
in our textbook though.

251
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,100
Is it not related to what we're
learning in this class?

252
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,870
Gosh, I'm impressed.

253
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,139
This shows that Jung has already
skimmed through the entire textbook.

254
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,509
The textbook isn't always perfect.

255
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,649
That's exactly why I brought
some supplementary materials today.

256
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,549
Give me a second. All right.

257
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,220
Shall we have a look now?

258
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,419
All right. "The Five Boxes"!

259
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,360
I hope you didn't forget
that the paper is due today.

260
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:22,389
Can someone collect them
and bring them to me?

261
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,500
I'll do it.

262
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,100
Great. Thanks, Jung.
It's 4:40pm now,

263
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,070
so bring them to me by 5pm, okay?

264
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
- Sure.
- Okay.

265
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,370
All right. I'll see you
in the next class.

266
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,110
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,590
You're almost done, right?

268
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,389
Yes, I'm almost there.
Give me a few minutes.

269
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:13,379
Do you have to be
staring at me like that?

270
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,710
Why? Am I bothering you now?

271
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,009
Yes.

272
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,480
That's good.

273
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,120
- Pardon?
- I'm really bothered by you too.

274
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,190
What do you mean by that...

275
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,090
Time's almost up.

276
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,610
(The system cannot
connect to the printer.)

277
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,909
- Jung, can you help me...
- What's wrong?

278
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,580
Goodness! I'm having a terrible day.

279
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,779
Why is all this happening
in front of him...

280
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,490
(The file has been
sent to your printer.)

281
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,150
The pages printed perfectly.

282
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,480
Jung. Hello.

283
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,819
Hi, Ju Yeon.

284
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,720
You can give it to me.
I'll take it.

285
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,319
No, it's okay. I'm supposed to
collect them anyway.

286
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you so much. Without
your help, I would have been...

287
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,400
I didn't do much at all.
Right, I almost forgot.

288
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,470
You couldn't take
any notes today, right?

289
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,940
Take this. Give it back to me
when you're done with it.

290
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:52,339
Thank you.

291
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:57,410
- I'll get going now. See you later.
- See you.

292
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,980
Thank you again.

293
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,289
I didn't know that you have
this kind of talent.

294
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,690
Seducing guys while pretending
that you aren't interested.

295
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,759
Ju Yeon, you got the wrong idea.

296
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,759
Don't be too excited thinking that
Jung is interested in you.

297
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,130
He's friendly and sweet
towards everyone.

298
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,910
Why did I come here?

299
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,779
I don't even know...

300
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,019
Goodness.

301
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,490
- What? What is it?
- Hi, In Ho. It's me.

302
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,000
Our boss is fuming mad right now.
What are you going to do?

303
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,400
Why should I even care?
I'm quitting.

304
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,200
Everyone has the freedom to choose
one's own dwelling and career.

305
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,000
These things are written
in the constitutional law.

306
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,410
In Ho, you sound quite intelligent
when you talk like that.

307
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,109
But I heard that you got
kicked out of your high school.

308
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,339
Shut it, you idiot.
I didn't get kicked out.

309
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,750
It was my decision to
walk out of there.

310
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,279
Anyway, our boss is out to
catch you, so you better hide.

311
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,720
Why is he trying to catch me?
What does he want from me...

312
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,720
If he asks you, just tell him
that I went to Busan.

313
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,089
- Or tell him that I left Korea.
- Will he believe that?

314
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,559
I don't care whether
he believes it or not!

315
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,730
Hello? In Ho...

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,730
Goodness, he hung up on me.

317
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,869
Was that Baek In Ho?

318
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,009
- No, it wasn't him.
- Where is he now?

319
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:32,509
He's not in Korea.

320
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,410
So was that an international call?

321
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,549
Gosh, Sang Geun.

322
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,920
He... He said that
he'd go to Seoul,

323
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,619
but it's possible that
he didn't end up going there.

324
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,789
- You're such a good liar.
- I'm sorry...

325
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,000
I shouldn't have come here.

326
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:05,710
What a great life!

327
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,819
They're asking for 250 dollars?
That's expensive.

328
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,160
Are you people made of money?

329
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,690
What's that?

330
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,400
These are papers from Professor
Kang's class. Can I leave them here?

331
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,670
Yes, just leave them there.

332
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:37,940
Jung, you're applying for early
graduation this semester, right?

333
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,309
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

334
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,210
Well, I just thought... Weren't you
planning on studying abroad?

335
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,579
You know that it's better
to graduate sooner.

336
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,220
You're really nosy.

337
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,990
You have enough credits.
Why don't you want to graduate?

338
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,259
It's none of your business.

339
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,829
I'm going to finish the semester.

340
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,500
Out of all the years
I've spent here,

341
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,769
I'm having the most fun
right now.

342
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,349
(Name: Hong Seol)

343
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,500
Why are you... What brings you here?

344
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,470
Well, I came here to find Jung.

345
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Why are you looking for him here?
He left a long time ago.

346
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Why are you getting
mad at me though?

347
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,809
How rude.

348
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,809
Yes, Professor Kang. The papers?

349
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,680
Shall I bring them over to you now?
Yes, sure.

350
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,950
Where are you now?

351
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,759
Today has been such a long day.

352
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,700
I ended up getting help from Jung.

353
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,930
How much will it cost me
to get this repaired?

354
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,619
Gosh, my USB drive. Goodness.

355
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,200
Why did I take this?

356
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,140
Isn't that mine?

357
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,180
Well, you didn't write it
yourself anyway.

358
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,420
What?

359
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,289
- You're seriously...
- I heard everything earlier.

360
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,960
You wouldn't have been able to
finish this without Jung's help.

361
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,700
Are you that obsessed with
getting an A plus?

362
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,099
Whether I got help from Jung
or not isn't important.

363
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
What were you
going to do with this?

364
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,940
Don't you think you've been
too mean to me since last year?

365
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,410
Do you like Jung that much?

366
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,809
Yes, I like him.
You've probably been...

367
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,509
jealous of the special treatments
he's been giving me.

368
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:32,480
But you won't even have a chance,
so stop hovering around him.

369
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:37,190
Otherwise, I'll do something a lot
worse than stealing your paper.

370
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,420
Are you two re-enacting a scene
from a soap opera?

371
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,490
It's my first time seeing girls
fight over a guy. It's so intense.

372
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,299
It looks like you're
part of this soap opera.

373
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,299
Jung, please don't get
the wrong idea of me.

374
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,009
Seol. Go and submit your paper now.

375
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,269
You know that it's past
the deadline now.

376
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,410
Ju Yeon.

377
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,220
- Yes, Jung.
- I'll forget what I just heard.

378
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,150
Make sure to
apologise to Seol later.

379
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,319
Wait, Jung.

380
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,890
And I...

381
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,690
I've never given you
any special treatments.

382
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,299
Let's go.

383
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,660
See you later.

384
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,839
Professor Kang, here's my paper.

385
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,670
You know that
it's past the deadline.

386
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:32,640
Yes. I am aware.

387
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,210
Then I don't need to explain it
further. I can't accept this.

388
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,380
Please...

389
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,819
Professor Kang, could you please
make an exception for me?

390
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,990
It's due to unforeseen
circumstances.

391
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,990
Listen.
Do think that it'd be fair...

392
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,089
for me to make an exception
for you and accept this?

393
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:48,589
Yes, come in.

394
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,299
Yes, Jung. What brings you here?

395
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Professor Kang.
It's actually my fault. I...

396
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,170
left out Seol's paper by mistake.

397
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,099
- You left it out?
- Yes.

398
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,009
Could you please accept her paper
and penalise me instead?

399
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,009
I'd really appreciate it.

400
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,410
So you're saying that it's
your mistake, not Seol's fault?

401
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,220
That's correct, Professor.

402
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,390
I guess I should accept it then.

403
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,390
- Thank you.
- However,

404
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,759
it was submitted late, so I cannot
give you more than a B plus.

405
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,200
Okay?

406
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:27,099
I'll see you both in the next class.

407
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,509
If I get a B plus on this paper,

408
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,779
I'll have to get 100 percent on
the exam and the team project...

409
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,720
- to get an A.
- Are you okay?

410
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,490
Yes. Thank you for everything today.

411
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,390
I keep getting help from you
all day long.

412
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,190
Cheer up.

413
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,299
I'll help you with the exam
and the team project.

414
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,400
Does he really mean it?

415
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,299
Gosh, I don't even know any more.

416
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,170
Right, Seol. Do you want to eat...

417
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,779
I guess you wouldn't.

418
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,549
All right, let's go!
Let's get this started.

419
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:21,720
Min...

420
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,019
- You probably read it wrong.
- I'm sure it was done as a joke.

421
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,089
- Isn't this Sang Cheol's writing?
- Goodness.

422
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,390
- You fooled us!
- Do you like her?

423
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,789
- He must like her.
- Look at him.

424
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
- Next vote.
- What's this?

425
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,099
- Ju Yeon and a heart.
- Ju Yeon!

426
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,099
- Who is it? Whose vote is it?
- Jae Woo even drew a heart.

427
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,700
Did she bribe him?

428
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,799
- Let's move on. Next one.
- Bo Ra!

429
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:44,210
- No way.
- I don't like her bulging eyes.

430
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:47,109
Did you say "Bulging eyes"?
That's insulting!

431
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,920
Eun Taek. I've waited 20 minutes.
Get yourself here right now!

432
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,619
I'm doing something important.
I'll call you in a bit. Bye.

433
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,690
- All right, next.
- Let's see.

434
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,119
- Bo Ra!
- Goodness.

435
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,859
- She's like a midget.
- What did you just say?

436
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,690
She can walk, so it's all good.

437
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,559
- As long as she has legs.
- I'm sure she's taller than you.

438
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,200
- She's definitely taller than you.
- All right, next.

439
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,299
Okay. One vote for Ju Yeon.

440
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:12,900
- I voted for Ju Yeon.
- She got another vote.

441
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,769
All right, attention.
This is the last one.

442
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,569
Bo Ra!

443
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,609
- Keep it down. Let's be quiet.
- Why?

444
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,880
- What if the girls find out?
- Who cares?

445
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,220
What do you think will happen
when we find out? Tell me!

446
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,589
You, Kwon Eun Taek!
Is this why you kept me waiting?

447
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,319
Give it to me. Come here!

448
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,990
You, idiot! Stop right there!

449
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,789
We were almost done. Goodness.

450
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,400
Who likes that girl, Bo Ra?

451
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,799
Gosh, how dirty! It's all soaked.

452
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,740
Listen. Only kids vote to pick
the prettiest girl in their classes.

453
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,710
How old are you guys, seriously?
How many of you did this?

454
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,480
- There were about eight of us?
- So who got the first place?

455
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:54,309
You came in first, of course.

456
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,480
Then what about Seol?

457
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,819
Seol came dead last
along with Min Soo.

458
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,349
What? Min Soo and Seol
came dead last together?

459
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,650
How is that even possible?

460
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,759
Goodness. Well, what guys think...

461
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,089
is very different from
what girls think.

462
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,490
This isn't right.
We need a blind date.

463
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,900
Why is that the conclusion?

464
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,970
- I was going to go on a blind date.
- Bo Ra.

465
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,200
Were you really going to
go on a blind date?

466
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,369
Yes. But I want to make Seol
go on it instead of me.

467
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,609
What do you think?
Isn't it a good idea?

468
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,809
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

469
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,619
It looks like all seats are taken.

470
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,990
Seol! I have to talk to you
about something important.

471
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,690
Meet me in the lobby at the library.

472
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:52,299
Did you find seats?
Gosh, I can't find any.

473
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,769
You can't say no, okay?

474
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,869
- What's wrong with you two?
- Go on a blind date.

475
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,710
I heard that the guy is
such a great catch.

476
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,410
- Don't miss out on this.
- He's right.

477
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,609
You two look like you have
all the time in the world.

478
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,720
How can you even talk about
a blind date during the exam time?

479
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,720
- It'll be after, of course.
- Hi, guys.

480
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:11,119
- You'll do it, right?
- Did you find seats?

481
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

482
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:14,319
Hi, Seol.

483
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,099
Jung. I saved a seat for you
in the library.

484
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,900
You'll sit with me, right?

485
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,630
Did you really save a seat for him?
How did you manage to do that?

486
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:26,299
I stayed here all night.

487
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,769
I'll try finding a seat myself.

488
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,009
Seol. I'll save your seat
if I find an extra spot.

489
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:36,609
- Did you save a seat for me?
- Why would I do that?

490
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,119
That witch. I can't stand her.

491
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,720
Seol. You'll do it, right?

492
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,690
Gosh, I really need to
find a seat...

493
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,859
- Guys.
- Yes?

494
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,599
The room that your club uses.
Is it empty now?

495
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
- No one is there now.
- That's right.

496
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,369
- Really?
- Use it.

497
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,000
- Give me the door code. Now.
- If I tell you...

498
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,210
- The door code, please.
- It's 1234.

499
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,509
This is good. Think about the blind
date while you're studying there.

500
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,779
- He's a great catch.
- Okay.

501
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:11,779
- All right.
- Seol, his name is Ahn Chil Hyuk.

502
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,579
You have to do it, okay?

503
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,990
Jung, where are you now?
Did you find a seat?

504
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,890
Why didn't you sit with me...

505
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,710
- You!
- Goodness! Who are you?

506
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:39,109
- I'm a graduate of this school.
- Gosh, what are you doing now?

507
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,210
- Why? Because I look like this?
- Gosh, why are you doing this...

508
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,319
Life feels like one fleeting moment.

509
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,019
It flies by so fast.

510
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,990
It's as if it has these wings.
Do you know what I'm saying?

511
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,319
Okay, Sir.

512
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,789
Do you have some money on you?

513
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:56,759
Well, I can't really help you.
Look over there.

514
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,700
Do you see the room on the second
floor with the light on?

515
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:01,200
Where? Over there?

516
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,500
Yes. If you go there,

517
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:06,539
you'll find a girl who can help you.

518
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,299
Go there and find her.

519
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,740
There will be leftover booze too.

520
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:15,309
Look at you, kids. You're drinking
booze when you should be studying.

521
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,410
Give me a one-dollar bill.

522
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,319
That girl will give it to you.

523
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,420
Goodness.
You're so cold-hearted...

524
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,119
All right, then. Bye bye, baby.

525
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,289
Go to the second floor.

526
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:30,289
Life flies by

527
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,299
No one can stop time

528
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,099
Right. I lost points because of
that girl, Hong Seol.

529
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,339
I'll use her to score brownie points
with Jung.

530
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,890
There's no one here.

531
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,759
Life is like alcohol, okay?

532
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,670
You kids feel like you can rule
the world now, don't you?

533
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,309
Where is this girl?

534
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,210
You! Where are you?

535
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,809
Come out!

536
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:34,890
What's going on?

537
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,490
Jung!

538
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,400
Wait, Jung.

539
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:45,599
Gosh, you're here.
I looked for you everywhere.

540
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,400
I kept calling you,
but you didn't answer.

541
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,839
- What's wrong?
- Please help me.

542
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,109
Seol is in danger now.

543
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,579
As I was leaving the library,

544
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,250
I saw Seol arguing
with a homeless man.

545
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,680
He was asking her for money.

546
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,450
She yelled and told him
to get lost while pushing him.

547
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,019
After that, she ran into
the building with the club rooms.

548
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,589
But he followed into the building
with a soju bottle in his hand.

549
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,200
You know that Seol can sound
mean and spiteful at times.

550
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,769
To be honest, that's why
I reacted that way yesterday.

551
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,769
The fact that you and I are close.

552
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:22,069
Seol has always been bothered by it.

553
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,880
But I still can't just leave her
in danger.

554
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,480
- She's still my classmate.
- Don't worry. She'll be fine.

555
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,119
By the way, Ju Yeon.

556
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,319
This is the exact opposite direction
from that building.

557
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,990
You could have gone to the other
building to get the security guard.

558
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,160
You came all the way here when
you couldn't even get a hold of me?

559
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,430
It doesn't really sound right.
Wouldn't you agree?

560
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,400
Take responsibility for
whatever trouble you caused.

561
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,420
Listen! Are you sleeping?

562
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,119
- I'm scared.
- Answer me!

563
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,260
Wake up. Wake up now.

564
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,590
Gosh, seriously.

565
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,099
You! It must be you. Come here.

566
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,900
Where do you think you're going?

567
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Don't run away. Don't ignore me.

568
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,969
Why are you ignoring me?

569
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,369
- No... Gosh!
- Why?

570
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,840
- Do you think I'll forgive you?
- Wait, Goodness!

571
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,039
Sir, please let go of me!

572
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,309
Gosh, where exactly is he now?

573
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,119
- Is it the homeless man?
- I'm not sure. Let's go up now.

574
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,519
- Sir, please...
- How dare you ignore me!

575
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,489
- I look like this now, but...
- Please, Sir... Gosh!

576
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,300
Why did this break?

577
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,900
What are you doing now?

578
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,730
Don't worry. We're here now.

579
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:58,199
What are you doing to the student?
She's a young girl.

580
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,000
- Well, I didn't mean to...
- Goodness, this man...

581
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,070
- Are you okay?
- Get out now.

582
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,559
Thank you.

583
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,530
- What happened to your arm?
- Well, this is...

584
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,500
I was opening a can of tuna
yesterday...

585
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,670
A can of tuna?

586
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,170
I just got a little scratch from it.

587
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,239
Let's go.

588
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,210
Where... Where are we going?

589
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,690
- I can... I can do this.
- I'll do it for you. Just let me.

590
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,889
Give me your arm.

591
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:03,829
Did you clean it properly?

592
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,340
I just washed it with water.

593
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,869
Let me see.

594
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,820
- I'll do this myself.
- You can't do it with one hand.

595
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,789
- Just let me do it myself.
- Give it to me.

596
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,019
Just hold your sleeve up.

597
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:37,699
Thank you.

598
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:39,570
Why do you put up with so much?

599
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,400
What is he saying?

600
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,409
Don't worry about other people
and put yourself first.

601
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,639
No one will acknowledge
all the things you do for them.

602
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,179
Is he really worried about me?

603
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,449
I'm saying this because
I'm really worried about you.

604
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,920
When you're going through something,
don't keep it boggled up inside.

605
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:01,489
Tell me. I'll help you.

606
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,360
This feels somewhat different
from how it's been.

607
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,769
And... Nam Ju Yeon is...

608
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,869
Ju Yeon...

609
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:14,699
She likes you a lot.
You know that, right?

610
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,110
Watching how you've been
helping me...

611
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,739
must have...

612
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,650
upset Ju Yeon a lot.

613
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,320
Did I just sound rude?

614
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,789
You're funny.

615
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,960
- Hi, Jae Woo.
- You startled me.

616
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,869
Didn't you get an A
on your presentation...

617
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,000
in Professor Han's class last year?

618
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,099
- Yes.
- Do you have that on your laptop?

619
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,500
- Why do you ask?
- Let me borrow it.

620
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,210
- No, you'll copy it again.
- I won't. I'll use it as a guide.

621
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,380
- I won't let you! Give it back...
- I'll just use it as a reference!

622
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,409
- I need my laptop back quickly.
- Okay, okay.

623
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,409
Gosh! You were going to lend it
to me but had to make all that fuss.

624
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,019
It's you, Seol!

625
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:02,920
I see you studying hard.

626
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:06,789
When you did the presentation
in Professor Han's class,

627
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,989
you and Jae Woo were
in the same group, right?

628
00:38:09,389 --> 00:38:10,989
The materials Jae Woo
presented that time.

629
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,530
Do you remember them?

630
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,500
- Yes.
- I see. Then find the file for me.

631
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,300
I'll be back in five minutes.
This is Jae Woo's laptop.

632
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,869
- Here.
- But why do I have to find it?

633
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,570
I need to rush to get
my graduation photos taken.

634
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:26,510
Am I actually graduating?
Finally, right?

635
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:28,610
Thanks in advance!

636
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,320
I'll just find it
and get it over with.

637
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:43,090
Where did he save it?

638
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,309
(Receipt from the beginning
of the semester party)

639
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,909
You're the one who posted on
the message board...

640
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,750
that I stole money from
the membership fee!

641
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,650
You're the only one who saw me...

642
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,650
counting the money on the staircase
that day!

643
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,889
You were there too.
Under the staircase.

644
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,559
I didn't do it. So who would it be?

645
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,559
Then the person who posted
on the school website last year...

646
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,900
and accused Sang Cheol
of stealing the money...

647
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,570
was Jae Woo, not Jung?

648
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,309
I won't tell anyone.

649
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
I wrongly accused him.

650
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,500
Should I apologise to him?

651
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,139
But I can't tell him about Jae Woo.

652
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,110
- Hi, Jung.
- Hi.

653
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,519
Did you finish taking
your graduation photos?

654
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,260
Not yet.

655
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,360
Right. I brought your notes.

656
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,300
- Yes.
- Thank you again.

657
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:45,920
Shall I...

658
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,019
treat you to a meal?

659
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,150
What?

660
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,219
The other day,
I promised you that I'd treat you.

661
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:59,090
Well, I also got a lot of help
from you recently, and...

662
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,070
I want to apologise to you
about something too.

663
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:10,510
I think...

664
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:15,210
I've been misjudging you
this whole time.

665
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,449
From last year to this year.

666
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,449
I'm a little bit sensitive,

667
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:26,590
so I tend to make rash judgements
about people...

668
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:30,989
and misunderstand their
intentions at times, so...

669
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,900
Right. I can see that tendency.

670
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,900
I know, right?

671
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:42,199
I'm trying not to be like that.
I'm really working on it.

672
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,340
It's my personality though,
so it's not easy...

673
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,340
Anyway, I'd like to apologise.

674
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,780
Seol.

675
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,650
- Let's take a photo together.
- Sorry?

676
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:58,420
No, I don't like taking photos.

677
00:41:58,489 --> 00:41:59,889
- Why? Let's just take one photo.
- I don't look good in photos.

678
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,260
- No, Jung. I'm not photogenic...
- Get ready.

679
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:04,090
- I'm sure you look great in photos.
- Okay, 1, 2...

680
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,590
I really don't like taking...

681
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,369
Look at this.
It turned out well, didn't it?

682
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:15,300
I told you I don't want to take it.
This isn't a good photo at all.

683
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,409
Why? You look cute in it.

684
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,710
- Delete it. How do I delete this?
- Hold on.

685
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:21,809
- Look. You look good in it.
- It needs to be deleted. My eyes...

686
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,880
- Let's delete it, please.
- Gosh, why?

687
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,679
You look good it in, but I don't.

688
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,980
(One year ago,
at the beginning of semester party)

689
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:31,320
He humiliated me
with his darn soju ssam.

690
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,460
I'd love it if he could
go join the army again.

691
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,289
That jerk, Kim Sang Cheol, keeps
humiliating me in front of everyone.

692
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,900
Gosh, I'm so annoyed. I'm too
embarrassed to even come to school.

693
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,570
Jae Woo.

694
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:47,539
What's up?

695
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,809
Are you going home now?

696
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Yes.

697
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,719
You're stressed out because of
Sang Cheol, aren't you?

698
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,750
Do you think I'm a joke too?

699
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,489
Why would I think you're a joke?

700
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,289
Think about it.

701
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:09,059
Between Sang Cheol who picks on
people for no reason and you,

702
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,630
whom would I think
is the strange one?

703
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,130
What do you want from me?

704
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,630
Everyone knows that
Sang Cheol is weird.

705
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,440
He picks on you more because
you're patient with him.

706
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,739
Are you going to let him
continue picking on you?

707
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,610
When did I let him? I always
told him not to treat me that way.

708
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:28,510
You know that's not enough.

709
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,980
Jae Woo.

710
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,750
What now?

711
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,590
Take this.

712
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,090
This is the receipt from today.
Can you give it to Sang Cheol?

713
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,889
I know that he doesn't
keep track of these things though.

714
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,730
Why are you giving this to me?

715
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,300
You can just throw it out
if you want.

716
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,909
Goodness.

717
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,010
It looked like at least 20 people
came out today.

718
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,920
He said that the money was all
used up. He stole some of it again.

719
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:09,789
Kim Sang Cheol, I'm going to
teach you a serious lesson.

720
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,789
- I think we both look good in it.
- Gosh, can you please delete it?

721
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:17,190
We look cute, don't we?
I'll send this to you too.

722
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,230
No, no. It's okay.
Please delete it for me.

723
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:37,679
My eyes...

724
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,320
(Ah Young)

725
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,219
- Hi, Ah Young.
- What are you doing tomorrow?

726
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,260
My class is cancelled.
Let's meet up and go for food.

727
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,860
Sure. My class will end at 4pm
tomorrow. Shall we meet then?

728
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,699
Yes, that sounds great.
Right.

729
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,269
I saw your friend, Jung,
again the other day.

730
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,800
I went up to him to say hi,
and he remembered my name.

731
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,440
He also bought drinks
for me and my friends.

732
00:45:06,409 --> 00:45:08,010
- I see.
- So I was just wondering...

733
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:12,050
Can you set me up with him?

734
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,219
I guess Jung is actually
a pretty nice guy.

735
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,389
- Sure.
- Really?

736
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:21,889
Thank you so much!

737
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,500
Hong Seol!

738
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,300
What are you guys up to?
Where are you going?

739
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,099
Pick her up!

740
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,210
- What are you doing now?
- She isn't heavy.

741
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,840
- She isn't heavy at all!
- What are you doing? Put me down!

742
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,980
- Gosh, put me down now!
- Just come with us.

743
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,210
- Don't move! Stop moving.
- Put me down, seriously!

744
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,420
- Stop moving!
- What are you two doing now?

745
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:48,849
Seriously!

746
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,690
- You should get out now.
- Ouch!

747
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,190
What are you doing, Bo Ra?

748
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,030
Turn around.
You should get changed first.

749
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,929
- Take these off too.
- What's all this about?

750
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:14,010
No! I don't want to!
I'm not wearing them.

751
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:15,710
Tap, tap, tap.

752
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,010
We're almost done.

753
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:20,980
Let's do your hair like this.

754
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,159
Ta-da!

755
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,460
Look at the outcome of my hard work.
What do you think?

756
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,190
- My goodness.
- Doesn't she look stunning?

757
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,400
Wow. You'll beat Min Soo
by about three votes.

758
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,400
It's at 6pm today.
Don't be late, okay?

759
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,699
You can't disappoint
Ahn Chil Hyuk. Got it?

760
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,699
You're so ready for it.

761
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,079
Hello.

762
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,119
Is today...

763
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,489
This looks weird, doesn't it?

764
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,090
No. It looks good on you.

765
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,599
I had to stop by somewhere.
That's why I'm dressed like this.

766
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,139
Seol. What time should I meet you
at the cafeteria?

767
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,210
Well, should it be today then?

768
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,980
The class will be over at 4pm,
and the blind date is at 6pm.

769
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,150
- Jung.
- Yes?

770
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,019
By chance, do you have
some free time today?

771
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,920
I mean after this class.

772
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,389
Yes. I'm free.

773
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,300
I'll meet you at 4:30pm
at the cafeteria, okay?

774
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,500
It's a little early for dinner,
isn't it?

775
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,510
It is a bit early, indeed.

776
00:47:52,409 --> 00:47:53,510
I know.

777
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:56,710
But I like that it's not crowded.

778
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:58,809
- Seol!
- Hi, Ah Young!

779
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,619
You look so pretty today.

780
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,090
You look stunning today, too.

781
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,519
- What's going on?
- You're so cute.

782
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:09,460
Well, Ah Young said
she hasn't eaten yet.

783
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:10,829
You're okay with her
joining us, right?

784
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,789
Of course.
Have you been keeping well?

785
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,599
Yes. I've been doing really well.

786
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:17,900
That was good.
It looked very natural.

787
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,500
- You can take this.
- Okay. Thanks.

788
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,239
- All right.
- We'll be over there.

789
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,739
Let's go.

790
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,110
I love being in university.

791
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,380
I'm taking this course called
"Visual Concepts",

792
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,150
and the professor is amazing.

793
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,280
I'm really enjoying everything.
I've been just blabbing away.

794
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,420
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

795
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,719
I'm having fun listening to you.

796
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,059
Ah Young. I guess...

797
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:43,789
you don't have a boyfriend yet?

798
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,889
No, I don't.

799
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,699
Why not? I'd imagine you'd be
popular amongst guys.

800
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,199
Right? She has...

801
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:54,400
such great skin
as well as a pretty face.

802
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,539
So she's very popular
amongst guys.

803
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,210
Plus, she has well-defined
facial features,

804
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,110
so she looks amazing in all photos.

805
00:49:02,179 --> 00:49:06,010
You know the messenger app. So many
guys get in touch with her...

806
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,320
because of her profile photo on it.

807
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,789
Gosh, stop it. You're overdoing it.

808
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,289
By the way, the two of you
would make such a cute couple.

809
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:22,530
Goodness. I am really overdoing it.

810
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,369
Do you want coffee?

811
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,400
Coffee...

812
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,139
I'll go and get coffee.

813
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,920
Here.

814
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,119
You're not having any?

815
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:45,719
No. I have to go and
take care of something.

816
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:48,159
Enjoy the food and coffee.

817
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,690
I'll talk to you later.

818
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,059
Seol looks amazing today,
doesn't she?

819
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,699
I hope she can always
dress like that.

820
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,400
- Yes.
- Actually,

821
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,199
she's going on a blind date today.

822
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,409
It's her first ever blind date,
so she must be nervous.

823
00:50:04,809 --> 00:50:06,440
I hope she meets someone nice.

824
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,179
A blind date?

825
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,849
Yes. Bo Ra set it up for her.

826
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,619
Well, it's just that...

827
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,320
You can tell me.
Please just get to the point.

828
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,059
What's your decision?
Can I work here or no?

829
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:26,090
I don't think that
your appearance...

830
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,199
really suits what we're
looking for in...

831
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,199
Goodness.
I'm so frustrated right now.

832
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,769
Well, Kim Byeong Ho.

833
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,710
I literally just moved to Seoul and
got a room even though I'm broke.

834
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,280
I pay 300 dollars a month
for this tiny room I got.

835
00:50:41,309 --> 00:50:44,079
And the fact that your restaurant is
right in front of it must be...

836
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,179
- a sign from the universe that...
- I'm sorry. I need to go.

837
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,719
Where are you going now
in the middle of the interview?

838
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,889
Kim Byeong Ho.

839
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,019
Kim Byeong Ho. Kim Byeong Ho!

840
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,260
What's your hobby?

841
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,489
Do you like surfing by chance?

842
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,090
- That's...
- Last year,

843
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,099
I went to the Gold Coast
to learn how to surf.

844
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,670
You know the Gold Coast, right?
It's in Australia. Have you been?

845
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,300
No, I haven't.

846
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,500
I see. I guess you're not
a fan of water sports.

847
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:13,179
Then, what do you like?
Golf? Tennis?

848
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:16,239
Or are you wilder than you seem?
Do you like paragliding?

849
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,449
No. I haven't tried
any of those sports.

850
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,889
Then, what have you
actually done in life?

851
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:28,460
Well, I took piano lessons
when I was young.

852
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,760
If that's the case, you must know
what's playing now.

853
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,699
It's the piano quartet
by Franz Schubert, "The Mullet".

854
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,630
Be patient.
He's Bo Ra's acquaintance.

855
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,230
- You don't even know it.
- I must be patient.

856
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,840
It sounds like you've been
living such a boring life.

857
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:44,940
- I can't really talk to you to...
- Gosh, I can't listen to this.

858
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:47,280
You're so vain and full of yourself.

859
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,440
You look like a pervert, you jerk.

860
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,750
You...

861
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:55,519
You treated me like a beggar, so
I was curious about who you are.

862
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,119
But you're nobody.

863
00:51:57,219 --> 00:51:59,090
Where did you meet this guy
who looks like a loach?

864
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,590
A loach? Goodness.
Do you know this guy?

865
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,889
I get that there's a shortage of
nice guys, but this one is a jerk.

866
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,389
- Why are you doing this...
- What should I do?

867
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,900
Shall I teach him a lesson?

868
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,400
Did you just call me a jerk?
Are you done talking?

869
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,070
I'm not done yet, so shut it.

870
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,869
Why am I even dealing
with a scum like you?

871
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,610
You look so crummy, you punk.

872
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,510
- Are you out of your mind?
- Gosh, wait.

873
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,809
If you end up hurting him,
will you have money to give him?

874
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:24,909
If you have that kind of money,
pay me to get my laptop repaired.

875
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,619
Your laptop...
What are you talking about now?

876
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,119
Goodness. Why did I even
bother coming here...

877
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,219
- Do you want a taste of this?
- Goodness.

878
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,989
Hey. He's like a faithful servant.

879
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,760
You look so unsophisticated.

880
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,000
Have you really lost your mind,
you jerk?

881
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,900
Yes. I've been living a boring
and unsophisticated life.

882
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,139
So what? Does it have
anything to do with you?

883
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,510
What? The piano quartet?
"The Mullet"?

884
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:55,039
You look so slimy and scummy.

885
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,110
And your English pronunciation
is horrible.

886
00:52:57,179 --> 00:53:01,019
Don't ever talk in English again.
I was embarrassed listening to you.

887
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:04,519
That girl is totally crazy.

888
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,250
Gosh, I'm going to have to
teach her a lesson...

889
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:07,760
Where do you think you're doing?

890
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,860
And if you want to be a show-off,
do it properly.

891
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,289
First of all, what's playing now
is Schubert's piano quintet.

892
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,500
It's "The Trout", not "The Mullet",
you idiot.

893
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,599
I guess you didn't study. Even
a crummy-looking punk like me knows.

894
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,670
Sit down now.

895
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,269
Something urgent happened
at home. I'm sorry.

896
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:24,570
Goodness, you jerk.

897
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,400
Jung.

898
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,239
What brings you here...

899
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,420
Did you have a good dinner?

900
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
Did you get to talk to Ah Young...

901
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,960
I was thinking that we...

902
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,639
have become pretty close
these days.

903
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,940
I guess you also approached me
with an agenda.

904
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,320
You're just like other people.

905
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,730
It's so hard to eat
one meal with you.

906
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,650
Goodness.
What kind of phone is this?

907
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:20,260
This girl must be so frugal.

908
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,889
Who in the world uses an old
phone like this these days?

909
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,190
I won't make money off selling this.

910
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,300
I should give it back to her
and make her buy me a meal.

911
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,500
Yu Jung?

912
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,070
Yu Jung?

913
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:40,440
No way. It can't be the same
Yu Jung that I know.

914
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:42,139
Enough of useless thoughts.

915
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,920
What's this now?

916
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:54,420
Are they going out?

917
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:57,289
And why do her eyes
look like this here?

918
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:01,960
What a small world!

919
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,000
Goodness. I can't believe this.

920
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,269
Hold on, so this girl is
Jung's girlfriend?

921
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,409
If that's the case...

922
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,619
Yu Jung, you just wait.
A big surprise is coming your way.

923
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,489
(Seol)

924
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,570
Yes, what's up?

925
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,500
Hi, Yu Jung.

926
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:46,309
Baek In Ho?

927
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:49,039
Gosh, I'm honoured.
You recognised my voice right away.

928
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,250
How did you...

929
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,349
Where are you now?

930
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:23,650
It's been a long time, Jung.

931
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:29,920
- What happened?
- Friend, you're making me sad.

932
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,250
Don't you want to catch up after
not seeing each other for years?

933
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,190
Are we that close?

934
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:43,159
Right.

935
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,699
We aren't that close at all.

936
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,170
- Give me her phone.
- How do you know this girl?

937
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,610
Who is she?
You took a photo with her...

938
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,949
and even came all the way here
to pick up her phone.

939
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,880
It's none of your business.

940
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,219
Then I shall ask her directly.

941
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:04,190
But I'm not sure if she knows.

942
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:06,920
Does she know what kind of
jerk you are?

943
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,289
Don't bother people around me.

944
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:13,289
What will you do if I bother them?

945
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,170
Right. Will you do something like
you did in the past?

946
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,269
Are you still going on about that?

947
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,340
I thought that you would've
come to your senses by now.

948
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:26,510
But you haven't changed at all.

949
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,639
You're the one who hasn't
changed one bit.

950
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:34,179
You don't seem to feel guilty
at all about ruining someone's life.

951
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,889
Guilt?

952
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,599
Why should I feel guilty?

953
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:57,210
Listen carefully now.

954
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,380
When I join my dad's company
upon graduating,

955
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,639
I'll cut off all support
related to you.

956
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,809
I've been letting you
have your way out of pity,

957
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,050
but I can't allow this any more.

958
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:12,050
- Out of pity?
- Go and tell your sister too.

959
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,719
There's only a couple of years left.

960
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,489
You two better figure out
your lives before time runs out.

961
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,269
Don't do anything stupid and
just return her phone to her.

962
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:02,469
What did I even expect?

963
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,079
I think he likes you.

964
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,489
You're not Jung's type.
Look at your mad hair.

965
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,820
You should dress more girly.

966
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:55,460
For this team project, the biggest
part of your mark will be based...

967
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,260
on how well all team members
collaborate with each other.

968
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:59,860
Jung, the presentation
is just around the corner.

969
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,230
What will it take for you to come
to your senses? Wake up now.

970
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,599
You can just say it. Why are you
making someone else look bad?

971
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:09,699
Cool it down. I don't know what it's
about, but try to forget it.

972
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,409
I didn't think I'd ever see you
again. What brings you here?

973
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:15,309
Take your sister, who is mooching
off my father, and disappear now.

974
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:18,309
This is my favourite moment.
Watching your mask fall off.

975
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,710
I'll see you around, Jung.

976
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:23,150
Jung. If you're available,

977
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:24,590
shall I buy you dinner?

978
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,090
- Seol.
- Yes?

979
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,960
What you see isn't everything.
Be careful with that jerk, Yu Jung.
