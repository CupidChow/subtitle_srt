1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,379
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,009
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,019
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,690
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,960
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,260
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,600
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,210
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,729
Jung. Why am I here?

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,600
We shouldn't really be
doing this right now.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,270
Why do you have to have
reasons for every single thing?

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
You came to your own conclusions
about me from the get-go.

14
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,510
From the beginning of
semester party last year...

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,209
to what happened with Sang Cheol
and with your course cancellation.

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,780
Can you be a little
more understanding?

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,459
Why do you have to nitpick
and quibble over everything?

18
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,430
Why does this conversation
have to unfold like this?

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,900
Fine, let's say I made
a mistake to you last year.

20
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,930
But I'm really doing my best now.

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,370
From the scholarship and your paper
to your job and the institute.

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,769
What more can I do?

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,049
I didn't want any of that!

24
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,650
So? Did you not like
getting my help?

25
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,590
Be honest. You've been
enjoying it, no?

26
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,260
Think about it again.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,430
How can you make me a bad person
after getting all the help from me?

28
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,500
How perfect do you expect me to be?

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,879
What will you do now?

30
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,250
Are you going to keep your
distance from me like this?

31
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,069
Seol! My dad came home
from the hospital.

32
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,770
I'll take you out for food.
Let's celebrate.

33
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,280
Even in my dreams,
Jung just says what he wants.

34
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,259
(Episode 6)

35
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,259
So? You haven't talked to him
for a few days after that?

36
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,759
- No, I haven't.
- Goodness.

37
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,360
If I were you, I would dance
in front of everyone to show off...

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,969
and tell the whole world
about how amazing my boyfriend is.

39
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,139
Just be grateful that you have
such a wonderful boyfriend.

40
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:23,680
I don't want to get help
from him in that way.

41
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,979
I'm also scared of
getting used to it.

42
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,319
So what will you do, then?
Will you continue seeing him or no?

43
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,889
- What?
- I agree that what Jung did...

44
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,550
isn't something that ordinary people
would do.

45
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,159
I also know that your logical brain
wouldn't allow you to understand it.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,789
But what does your heart say?
Are you going to break up with him?

47
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,330
Jung. Let's meet...

48
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,039
I want to talk to you in person.

49
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,169
Are you...

50
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,080
available tomorrow by any chance?

51
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,449
I used up the money.
Send me more money.

52
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,460
This spoiled girl.
Has she really lost her mind?

53
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,259
Why is she asking me
for money every single day?

54
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,160
It's like pouring money
into a bottomless pit.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,300
When will she grow up?

56
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,470
How could she do this? I'm so broke.

57
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,870
I already gave her all I had.

58
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,569
What's wrong?

59
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm deep in thought right now.

60
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,980
- About what?
- About when you'll buy me a meal.

61
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,259
Well, I feel lame to
keep bringing it up,

62
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,959
but I don't really want you
to forget about it.

63
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,629
Never mind.

64
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:54,800
This must be what it feels like to have friends...
who don't pay back after borrowing money.

65
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:58,100
Tell me. Why do you always pester me
about buying you a meal?

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,569
I see that you're having
so much fun with it.

67
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,839
You said you'd buy me a meal to
thank me for helping your TA.

68
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,709
Look at you. You're pretending that
you've forgotten it all.

69
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,050
- Right, that thing.
- You're unbelievable, seriously.

70
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,420
- Right. I did say that.
- Do you remember now?

71
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,019
I'll treat you. I'll buy you a meal.
Shall we go today?

72
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,629
- Today is great. Are you serious?
- Yes. Today is good? Today?

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,889
- You better not run away.
- Why would I do that?

74
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay. Today, it is then.

75
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,459
I'll meet you outside
after my class.

76
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,370
Perfect. I want beef barbecue.

77
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,269
Gosh, you startled me.

78
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,180
(Seol)

79
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,680
(Of course. What are you doing now?
You must be tired.)

80
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,189
(Delete)

81
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,720
(Yes)

82
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,029
(Delete multiple messages.)

83
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,769
(Select messages.)

84
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,339
(Delete)

85
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,810
(Yes)

86
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,259
Jung. I want to talk to you
in person.

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,959
Are you available tomorrow
by any chance?

88
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,040
We have amazing news
for you today.

89
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,910
A Korean student won...

90
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,209
a prestigious international
piano competition.

91
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,120
His name is Jang Yeo Joon.

92
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,480
Today, we'll be speaking with...

93
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,089
I'm going to be 10 minutes late.

94
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,889
Goodness, I don't get it.

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,060
Why is she texting about
being 10 minutes late?

96
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,959
It's really impressive.

97
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,170
Out of many students you have,

98
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,970
I'm sure Jang Yeo Joon
has a special place in your heart.

99
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,370
You once said that meeting him was
like discovering a pearl in the mud.

100
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,839
How did you discover
such a talented student?

101
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,579
Right. Jang Yeo Joon...

102
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:25,379
was already shining brightly
like a diamond when I first met him.

103
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,689
I noticed his amazing talent
right away.

104
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,459
All I did was creating a good environment
for him to practise in and guiding him.

105
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,870
Well, I must say that I'm very
happy and honoured to have met...

106
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,300
and taught a student like him.

107
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,519
Baek In Ho.

108
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,149
You're trying to look cool again
while you're playing the piano.

109
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,990
Will you go on the competition
with this kind of attitude?

110
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,360
I'm so prepared for the competition.
I've been doing my best.

111
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,239
Be humble. No one can ever be
perfectly prepared for these things.

112
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,829
Okay. I'll remember that.

113
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,970
Goodness. I guess people applaud
when you play the piano like this.

114
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,709
Applause is like a knife.
Praise is like a poison.

115
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,410
You'll find out what that means
later on.

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,419
You know that you're
very special to me, right?

117
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,919
I know.

118
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,059
Isn't this awesome?
What do you think?

119
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,470
In Ho.

120
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,679
You should get the treatments.

121
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,179
In Ho, I believe in you.

122
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,970
Gosh...

123
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,690
What took you so long?

124
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,759
I got soaked because of you,
Mad Hair.

125
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,169
Let's forget about dinner.

126
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,710
It's raining,
so let's go for drinks.

127
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,080
Come on.

128
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,659
Why aren't you drinking?

129
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,970
I can't drink much,
so I usually drink slowly.

130
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,269
You're a handful.

131
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,070
Is there anything else you're
good at besides studying?

132
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:49,539
You must be proud of being good
at everything else but studying.

133
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,279
What? Don't talk back to me.

134
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,480
By the way,

135
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,679
did you see that earlier?

136
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
See what?

137
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,259
You getting soaked in the rain?

138
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:19,940
You're here.

139
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,980
I thought of the last time I was
here with you and stopped by.

140
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:31,779
I didn't expect to
actually see you here.

141
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:35,289
Gosh, how did things
end up like this?

142
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,519
Why do I feel so guilty, as if
I've been caught cheating on him?

143
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,789
I'm supposed to be upset with him,
not the other way around.

144
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:45,960
Why are you here
sitting like a mooch?

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,200
- Like a mooch?
- I clearly remember asking you...

146
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,629
to stop bothering people around me.

147
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,700
You're obviously not listening.

148
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,940
Right, you did ask me
not to do that.

149
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,840
But what should I do? I'm here
because she wanted to buy me drinks,

150
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,610
so I just can't disappear
as you wish.

151
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,409
Just leave if you can't stand me.

152
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,789
All right. You should stay
if Seol said she'd treat you.

153
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,259
- Please give us another glass.
- Sure.

154
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,460
It looks like you have
lots of free time.

155
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,659
Shouldn't you be working harder
to support your sister?

156
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,830
You shouldn't have time for this.

157
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,470
Shut it, you jerk. Who made
my situation become like this?

158
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,399
And stop talking about my sister.

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,769
Are you blaming me for everything?

160
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:33,009
Why? You said that you came back
to see me acting this way.

161
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,409
Gosh, stop it.
All you two do is argue and fight.

162
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,779
Why are you being like this?

163
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,179
Right. Seol didn't do
anything wrong.

164
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,490
Whatever. I don't care any more.
Let's just drink. Drink up.

165
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:46,059
I never thought that I'd be
drinking with you two.

166
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,460
It'd be even more fantastic
if Baek In Ha was here.

167
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:53,860
Baek In Ha...
Is that In Ho's sister?

168
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,029
That super pretty girl...

169
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,669
How does Jung know...

170
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,610
Thanks for the text message.

171
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,080
No problem.

172
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,450
Did she really say
she wanted to drink?

173
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Yes.

174
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,080
Why is that any of your business?

175
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,549
Well, I wanted to treat him
because...

176
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,159
he helped me with something.

177
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,559
You should've told me.
I could've helped you.

178
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,330
We had a fight.

179
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,070
Did you two fight?
That's ridiculous.

180
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,669
You should be kissing and
hugging instead of fighting.

181
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,139
Just break up!
You're not a good match.

182
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,370
Shut your mouth, okay?

183
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,110
Do you want to know his past?
His family is loaded,

184
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,980
so he went out with
a truck full of girls.

185
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,580
Their tears together would make
the Han River overflow.

186
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,490
It was easy for him to get girls,
so he always had a new girlfriend.

187
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,120
Did he think he was
Don Juan or what?

188
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,289
Plus, he loves pretty girls
with hot bodies.

189
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,960
- Stop it.
- Why should I? It's true.

190
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,529
He had a truck full of girlfriends.

191
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,070
He likes pretty girls
with hot bodies.

192
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,009
Then, did you go out with...

193
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,250
In Ho's sister too?

194
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,679
- No!
- No!

195
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,090
- Not at all.
- Never. What are you talking about?

196
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,320
Well, there's nothing wrong with it.

197
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,529
You guys grew up together,

198
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,460
- and she's gorgeous...
- I told you they didn't go out!

199
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,570
You have no experience
in dating, right?

200
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,570
What are you talking about?

201
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,240
I had a boyfriend in high school.

202
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,139
He was so popular.

203
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,350
All girls were very jealous
because he was so good-looking.

204
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,379
- You met him at a church, right?
- How did you know?

205
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:54,149
- He played the drums.
- You followed him around...

206
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,389
- and got dumped, didn't you?
- What are you talking about?

207
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,720
Don't lie. I'm sure that's
what happened. I can tell.

208
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,960
I guess you just can't quit
the habit of babbling away.

209
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,129
Why should I quit this?
It's so much fun.

210
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,059
What? What's your problem?

211
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,369
Why are you glaring at me?
Do you want to pick up a fight?

212
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,529
Aren't you scared?

213
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,470
- Here they go again.
- Listen.

214
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,970
Jerks like you who spend
all their time at gyms...

215
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,170
can't beat someone like me
who's experienced in real fights.

216
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,539
If you and I fight...
What's that word?

217
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,609
You'll end up outside of
the atmosphere of Earth, okay?

218
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,779
- Gosh, you sound so childish.
- The atmosphere of Earth...

219
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,380
If that's what you say,
what expression should I use?

220
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,319
I'll bury you deep down
in the mantle?

221
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,390
What did you just say?

222
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,920
I teach at an English
language institute.

223
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,529
Did you just question my mental
status? I'm mentally very healthy!

224
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,960
Gosh, how dumb can you be...

225
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,630
You, jerk! What did you just say?

226
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,430
Goodness! Shut your mouth,
both of you!

227
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,170
Are you two elementary school kids?

228
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,500
Am I indebted to you?

229
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,640
This one sulks all the time,

230
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,579
and this one constantly pesters me
to buy things.

231
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,410
- Mad Hair, are you drunk?
- Mad Hair...

232
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,980
Who is Mad Hair?

233
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,420
You're looking at
all-natural curly hair.

234
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:06,720
Because my hair is naturally curly,
the strands are a little thick.

235
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,660
- Repeat after me!
- Goodness.

236
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,160
Seol, stop drinking.

237
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:15,630
Repeat after me.
All-natural curly hair.

238
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,210
Gosh, what do you want me to do?

239
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,509
Do you think I'm not curious at all
because I'm keeping quiet?

240
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,079
There're so many questions
that I want to ask.

241
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,779
What do you want to know?

242
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:32,819
Well...

243
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,789
Did you and In Ho's sister
go out or...

244
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:41,059
- I said we didn't!
- They didn't!

245
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,660
You didn't go out with her?

246
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,029
Fine, then.

247
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,799
- Gosh, Mad Hair. Is she okay?
- Seol. Seol.

248
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,779
Goodness, seriously.
Look at this girl. She's wasted.

249
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,410
She shouldn't have drunk so much.

250
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,079
Why are you following us?

251
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm worried that you might
do something to this drunk girl.

252
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,960
Watch your hands.
You better not misplace them.

253
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,660
I was being nice to you earlier
because of Seol.

254
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,160
Stop being so nosy and just go home.

255
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,160
Do you think I'll listen to you?

256
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,640
By the way...

257
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,410
Do you really think that...

258
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,410
you didn't do anything to
apologise to me about?

259
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,059
Then what about you?

260
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,099
Fine. I won't ask you
this question any more.

261
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:57,769
Never.

262
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,000
You, jerks!

263
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,579
Look. What are you two
doing with my sister?

264
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,880
- Put her down right now!
- Who are you, you jerk?

265
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,480
Why did you throw
that bottle of water at me? Why?

266
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,849
Put down my sister right now!

267
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,750
Hong Seol. Wake up!

268
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,660
- Gosh, wake up now.
- Be careful.

269
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,559
You look horrendous. Goodness.

270
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:22,930
Hi, Joon.

271
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,460
Gosh, I feel like throwing up...

272
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,700
What's wrong? Hold on, hold on.

273
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,900
Don't do it. Swallow it.
Just swallow it!

274
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,569
- Goodness.
- Let's take her home.

275
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:34,400
- Okay.
- Hurry. Hurry up.

276
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,279
Six.

277
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,619
You...

278
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,880
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

279
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,690
Are you up now?

280
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,819
What are you doing here?
When did you come? Why are you back?

281
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,359
Well, it's been a few days.

282
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,630
- What about your school?
- I'm going to take time off.

283
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,660
Dad closed down his business,
and Mum opened a restaurant.

284
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,200
I can't really be studying
in the States at a time like this.

285
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,529
What is this nonsense now?

286
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,039
Do Mum and Dad know
that you're back?

287
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:10,569
Seol. My face looks like this
because Dad beat me up.

288
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,509
Gosh. I can't believe he hit
his son in the face like this.

289
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,480
I'm going to stay here
for a little while, okay?

290
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,150
- You, jerk! I can't believe you.
- Ouch! It hurts. Ouch!

291
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,650
- When will you come to your senses?
- You must've gone crazy.

292
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,819
Did you say that I'm crazy?
How dare you call your sister crazy!

293
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:26,960
You're seriously...

294
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,759
Today is your lucky day.

295
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,630
Did you have a good sleep?
How are you feeling?

296
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,730
Message me when you get up.

297
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,769
Which one is your boyfriend?

298
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,740
Who are you talking about?

299
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,309
The punk?
Or the nerd?

300
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,150
Both of them are good-looking.

301
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,680
Anyway, I hope that
it's not the nerd.

302
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,490
Why is that?

303
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,460
Seol, you don't remember?

304
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,759
Seriously?

305
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,960
You threw up on that nerd's
head last night!

306
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:07,930
Are you serious right now?

307
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,730
I was just teasing you.

308
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,140
No, you threw up
in front of the door.

309
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,309
Gosh, it was disgusting.

310
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,410
I guarantee
that nerd will dump you very soon.

311
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,849
Gosh, my heart.
Goodness, you're too much.

312
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,920
I almost had a heart attack.

313
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,789
You almost gave your sister
a heart attack!

314
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:32,690
You almost killed me, you jerk!

315
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,519
Gosh, stop it.
I was just teasing you.

316
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,029
I should die. I should just die.

317
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,039
I'm telling you right now.
I'll never drink again.

318
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,339
Goodness. Yes, you better.

319
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,369
I was so embarrassed for you
yesterday. Seriously.

320
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,750
Yes. Yes.

321
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,650
Yes, Mum. I'll let him
stay at my place for a few days.

322
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,220
Yes, don't worry. Bye.

323
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,549
Morning, Sweetie.
Are you leaving the house now?

324
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,619
Yes. What are you doing?

325
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,230
Right, I haven't told you.
I'm moving.

326
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,460
The landlord isn't here yet though.

327
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,470
I know. I'm not going to
wait for her.

328
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,740
But why...

329
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,940
I have a favour to ask you.

330
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,809
The thing about me and Yoon Seob...

331
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,609
Gosh, don't worry.
I'll keep it to myself.

332
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,250
Okay. Thanks.

333
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,319
When I first met you, I gave you
a hard time about the noise issue.

334
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,519
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:38,920
It's okay.

336
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,390
Take care, okay?

337
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,940
We had a fight because
I was upset with him.

338
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,369
I should just blame it all
on alcohol.

339
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Did you get home okay last night?

340
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,150
- I was thinking and...
- No.

341
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,579
Let's not think.

342
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,720
Seol, you shouldn't drink
a lot any more.

343
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Okay?

344
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,359
Okay.

345
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,130
Yesterday...

346
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,900
Did I make lots of stupid mistakes?

347
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,940
Do you really want to know?

348
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,069
No.

349
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,680
Well, it was actually quite cute.

350
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,009
My next-door neighbour.

351
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,880
He moved out.

352
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,589
Did he?

353
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,230
- Jung.
- Yes?

354
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,900
I'm sorry for getting upset with you
because of what Mr. Heo told me.

355
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,029
I know that you didn't mean it,

356
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,339
so I'll try to understand it
and let it go.

357
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:05,039
But, you should promise me...

358
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,039
that you won't do
those things again.

359
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,950
If it's about me,
you should ask me first.

360
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,849
Okay. I promise.

361
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,230
I'm thinking we should go
for a movie after eating here.

362
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,430
What do you think?

363
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,539
- A movie?
- I already bought tickets.

364
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,670
This movie will be fun.

365
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,539
I was ready to be scolded more.
Are you forgiving me this easily?

366
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,650
I'll be easy on you this time.

367
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:03,430
Come out, you jerk. I saw you.
Who is it?

368
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,500
Who are you?

369
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,240
Hi, In Ho!

370
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,240
You, idiot...

371
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
How did you find me?

372
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,380
- Your boss sent you here, right?
- No.

373
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,319
I helped you find a room and
protected you from those bullies.

374
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,920
How dare you do this to me!

375
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,319
No, don't get the wrong idea.

376
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,690
I came here because
I saw you in this.

377
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,529
- Get it out of my face.
- But you're in trouble.

378
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,529
Boss already knows.
You should leave here now.

379
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,730
Gosh, this is crazy.

380
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,039
And if you end up changing your
number, you have to give it to me.

381
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
In Ho. We should catch up.
Let's go and get food.

382
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,609
Stop talking nonsense.
Just get out of my face now.

383
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,549
- Okay. I'll go. I'm going.
- Get lost. Go away now!

384
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,210
In Ho. Don't get caught, okay?

385
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,950
- Get lost, seriously.
- Okay! Goodness.

386
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,220
I'm really going now!

387
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,720
- Bye, In Ho! Don't get caught!
- How did Boss find out?

388
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,920
Goodness. Do I have to move again?

389
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,630
I always have to leave just as
I'm starting to feel comfortable.

390
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,029
I'll have to change my phone number
and find a place to live too.

391
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,140
Plus, what am I going to do
about Baek In Ha?

392
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,039
I knew it. No wonder
my life was peaceful for a change.

393
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,660
Hi. It's me, In Ha.
Have you been keeping well?

394
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,029
Yes. What's up? Why are you
calling me out of the blue?

395
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,769
Well, I'm calling because
I missed you.

396
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,240
By any chance, do you have
some free time tomorrow?

397
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,910
Shall we hang out?

398
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,740
Why? Do you need money?
Or, no one wants to date you?

399
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,109
Well, I'm sorry. I need to see
my girlfriend tomorrow...

400
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,650
Shut it, you jerk!

401
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,220
I felt bad about dumping you,
so I was going to give you a chance.

402
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,460
You should feel bad about yourself.

403
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,519
I knew that you'd end up like that.

404
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,859
Go and hang out with that punk
if you're that desperate.

405
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,029
Don't ever call me again.

406
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,130
Jerk! You, jerk!

407
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,569
Gosh, darn it!
If I ask him for money again,

408
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,210
he will give me such a hard time
and go on and on about it.

409
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,940
I do not want to hear it from him.

410
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:39,220
- I have no money.
- Gosh, seriously!

411
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,029
And don't call me.
I'll disappear for a little while.

412
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,029
Well, you won't be able to call me
anyway when I change my number.

413
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,099
What are you talking about now?
Did you get yourself in trouble?

414
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,500
Why do you even ask? It's not like
you're going to help me.

415
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:56,970
I'm sorry.

416
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:06,349
The food was delicious,
and I really enjoyed the movie too.

417
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,250
I'm happy to hear that.

418
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,619
When are you moving?

419
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,660
Soon. I'll move before
the new semester starts.

420
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,259
I feel like everything
is coming to an end.

421
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,799
The institute, living alone
and the break.

422
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm sad.

423
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:29,539
Our relationship
isn't ending though.

424
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,079
We'll continue seeing each other
after the semester starts.

425
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,450
I know, right?

426
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
This.

427
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,529
You seem to like watches, so...

428
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,140
I didn't expect this at all.

429
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,740
But it may look a little
cheap for your style,

430
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,039
so I'm a bit worried.

431
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,720
You don't like it?

432
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,799
I guess you don't like it.

433
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,750
I like it.

434
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,779
I love it.

435
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,220
Thanks.

436
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,529
Yesterday, we didn't argue at all
and had a great conversation.

437
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,559
I hope that every day can be
like yesterday.

438
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,369
Gosh, look at me now.
I must be going crazy.

439
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,930
You! All-natural Curly Hair!

440
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
I found her.

441
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,680
Tell me. Is your stomach feeling
okay, All-natural Curly Hair?

442
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:24,549
- Gosh, stop it.
- Why?

443
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,319
Am I not even allowed to call you
All-natural Curly Hair?

444
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,819
Seriously! Stop it now.

445
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,819
Gosh, you're even yelling at me now.
I've been too easy on you.

446
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,130
I've been way too easy on you.

447
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,500
Wait, where are you going?

448
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,569
Will I not be able to see her
after this?

449
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,339
Gosh, I shouldn't have
gone for drinks with him.

450
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,079
- Hello.
- Hi. A pack of cigarettes, please.

451
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:00,549
What's going on?
Why is Oh Yeong Gon here?

452
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,990
Seol, stop running! Let's talk.

453
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,519
Gosh, stop being so difficult.

454
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:09,059
I just want to talk to you.

455
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,559
Why are you being
so cold towards me these days?

456
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,529
You don't answer my calls,
and you ignore my texts too.

457
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,329
You're making me look as if
I'm in one-sided love.

458
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:20,240
Yeong Gon. Are you mad?

459
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,569
Why would I have
any feelings for you?

460
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,009
If you don't stop this, I'll report
you to the police for stalking me.

461
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,009
Stalking? I see.
But what's not what we're doing.

462
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,880
You're just playing hard to get.
Do you see the difference?

463
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,690
Stop being so difficult though.
It's starting to annoy me.

464
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,119
The entire world knows
the fact that you like me.

465
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,829
Even Jung knows too.

466
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:46,900
- What?
- I heard you said that you like me.

467
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,130
I'm doing this because
Jung reassured me.

468
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,069
Seol, people are saying that
we'd make a cute couple.

469
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,440
What are you talking about now?

470
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,079
You're really annoying me right now.

471
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,609
Let's talk. Come with me.

472
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,880
- I said, come with me!
- Let go of me!

473
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,910
Come on.

474
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,549
Would you like this one?

475
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,119
It's five dollars.

476
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you. See you again.

477
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,269
No way. Does he go to one of
the institutes around here?

478
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,909
What if I bump into him on the way?

479
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:32,909
I should go through the alleyway.

480
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,849
Hong Seol?

481
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,050
Goodness! It was you, Hong Seol.

482
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,590
I saw you at the convenience store,
but I wasn't sure if it was you.

483
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,590
Do you go to one of
the institutes in this area?

484
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,530
What's wrong? Why are you
looking at me like a stranger?

485
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,989
Did my leave of absence
make you forget me already?

486
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,530
I have nothing to talk to you about.

487
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,000
- Come here. I'm not done talking.
- Let me go!

488
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,800
- I have something to tell you.
- I don't want to talk to you!

489
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:03,469
Seol, why are you acting like this?
You're making me feel embarrassed.

490
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,840
Listen, I have no feelings
for you any more.

491
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I'm going back to school,
so let's be friends again.

492
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,150
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No! Wait!

493
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,820
Goodness,
you're still so cold towards me.

494
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,250
Don't be so cold to me.
It hurts my feelings.

495
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:20,619
By the way, I heard that
you've gotten close to Jung.

496
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,030
Are you going out with him?

497
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,260
Really? Seriously?

498
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,199
Both you and I had to suffer
because of that jerk, Yu Jung.

499
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,300
And you're dating him now?
Have you lost your mind?

500
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:36,039
- Go away.
- Come to your senses already!

501
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,739
There's no way that he'd be
serious about you!

502
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,210
He's just toying with you!

503
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,940
I said, go away!

504
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,150
Goodness. You treat me
like a piece of garbage.

505
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,519
Seol, I'm impressed though.
How did you seduce that jerk?

506
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,760
You couldn't even say a word
in front of guys in the past.

507
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:56,289
I can hurt you badly... Ouch!

508
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,199
Goodness.
You're seriously polluting my ears.

509
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,599
Why did you hit me
on the back, you jerk?

510
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,099
Who are you?

511
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,800
Why are you bothering this girl
looking all pathetic?

512
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,440
Gosh, you must want a taste of this!

513
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,150
I was just going to let you hit me
and pay me a settlement.

514
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:19,849
But you can't even punch, so
I have to teach you a lesson.

515
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,949
Hong Seol, you're really impressive.

516
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,719
From Yu Jung to Kwon Eun Taek.

517
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,989
You even have this punk
following you around.

518
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,260
Shut your mouth.

519
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:32,090
You used to nag me to stop
flirting with other girls.

520
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,130
Look at you seducing these guys and
acting like a piece of trash. Hey...

521
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,699
I know people like you very well.

522
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,940
There's no treatment for a lunatic
like you who bothers women.

523
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,469
The only cure is
getting beaten up.

524
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,280
- Gosh, Baek In...
- Goodness...

525
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,750
Are you scared now?
Get lost, you scum.

526
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,420
I said, get lost!

527
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:01,420
What a rat.

528
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:06,099
Listen. I'm going to sue you.
I'm going to make you get locked up!

529
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,130
- Go ahead! Do it, you jerk.
- Hey!

530
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,929
Go ahead and do it.
I won't let you get away.

531
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,199
I'm going to tell
the police everything.

532
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,469
From you stalking me since last year
to how you threatened me today.

533
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,110
Let's see who will get in trouble.

534
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,909
- Go ahead and sue.
- That's right. That was great.

535
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,150
Fine. Do whatever you want.

536
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:26,449
Let me warn you though.
Jung will make you suffer soon.

537
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,780
Think about it. Last year,

538
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,019
why do you think he sent me to you?

539
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,460
Let's be friends again
when the semester starts.

540
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,230
Shut your mouth, you jerk.

541
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,929
- Go away! Go away, you jerk!
- You, rat.

542
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,000
- Get lost!
- Don't ever show up again!

543
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,730
I'm going to
turn your guts inside out!

544
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,769
Mad Hair. Who is that jerk?

545
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,309
He was involved in whatever
you went through with Jung, right?

546
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,340
That piece of... Be careful, okay?

547
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,510
And watch out rats like him
who like to play the victim.

548
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,780
People like him are
perfect targets for Jung.

549
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,849
Jung can manipulate them
so easily. Got it?

550
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,760
Do you understand?

551
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,260
Go in now.
You'll be late for your class.

552
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,230
- Thomas!
- Thomas!

553
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,199
Why? What's going on?
Go. Go now.

554
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,510
It's time to go home.
Bye, kids!

555
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,010
Bye, Thomas!

556
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,010
Hey, wait for me.

557
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,110
Thomas.

558
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:35,650
- A girl left something for you.
- A girl?

559
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,619
My fans are just not leaving me
alone. What is it?

560
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,260
It's that bag over there.

561
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,900
Who brought this?

562
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,039
I don't know her name. It's the one
with frizzy hair and bleary eyes.

563
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,739
Hey, don't leave it here.
I don't want a mess on that table.

564
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,110
Mad Hair...

565
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:02,710
Why did she do such a useless thing?

566
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,989
You may be looking at these words...

567
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:12,619
and thinking,
"Gosh, those are too elementary."

568
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:16,329
But most people don't know
how to pronounce them properly.

569
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,489
How do you pronounce this word?

570
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:20,429
The entire world knows
the fact that you like me.

571
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,130
Jung is aware of it too.

572
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,199
Think about it. Last year,
why do you think he sent me to you?

573
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,099
People like him are
perfect targets for Jung.

574
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,369
Jung can manipulate them
so easily. Got it?

575
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,019
Things are finally good
between me and him.

576
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,619
I shouldn't bring up
any more troublesome stories.

577
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,989
Wait, Mad Hair.

578
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:56,900
Jung!

579
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,139
What brings you here?

580
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,840
I want to give you a ride home.

581
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,909
- Get in.
- Okay.

582
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,099
Well, I guess I don't have to waste
my time to walk her home.

583
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,300
That worked out.

584
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:40,510
This doesn't feel awkward
any more, right?

585
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,809
Oh? You're wearing the watch.

586
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,380
I'm going to wear this every day.

587
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,679
It looks great on you.

588
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,719
What's wrong?

589
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,989
I thought I saw someone.

590
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,500
I don't see anyone.

591
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,610
I guess I was mistaken.

592
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:13,340
- He has red hair.
- Let's go.

593
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:14,710
Yes, totally.

594
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,550
Yes! She's here now.

595
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:21,150
Gosh, finally. You're friends
with that pervert, right?

596
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,389
Yes! You said you had drinks
with him too. Where did he go?

597
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,989
He's not a pervert.

598
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,690
- Gosh, stop it.
- Goodness.

599
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,860
Your next-door neighbour.
What does he look like?

600
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:32,760
Well, he's on the short side.

601
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,000
- He's chubby and...
- Is he the one you were with...

602
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,929
- at the police station?
- Yes, that's right.

603
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,099
Look. You said that he was tall...

604
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,409
and wearing a hat
over his red hair.

605
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,380
Well... He could've lost weight
and dyed his hair.

606
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:49,210
I'm sure it was him.
I'm convinced.

607
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,949
You're being unreasonable.
Stop bothering all these people.

608
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,380
Why are you acting this way?

609
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,519
Where are you going?

610
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,420
- Tell us where that pervert is!
- Gosh, please stop it.

611
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,820
- Give us his new address!
- Goodness. Please calm down.

612
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:01,559
- Gosh, Sir. Please...
- We'll investigate, so please...

613
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,429
They still don't know who did it.

614
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,400
He won't come back, will he?

615
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,300
Don't say that.
You're scaring me.

616
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,380
You should get going.

617
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,940
Shall I stay here tonight?

618
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,849
Sorry?

619
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,880
Your brother
isn't staying here tonight.

620
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:29,619
Are you going to be okay alone?

621
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:44,530
Well, Joon... Look at this mess.

622
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,000
He left my room so messy.

623
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,809
He should learn to
clean up after himself.

624
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,679
- Here. Have a seat here.
- Thanks.

625
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,920
Right. Coffee.

626
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:01,349
I don't want coffee.

627
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:05,519
- Really?
- I'll just have some water.

628
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,070
Here.

629
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:38,690
Well, I'll go and get changed.

630
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,119
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

631
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:11,920
Jung is in my room.

632
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,320
I can't believe it.

633
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,130
I used to always have
my guard up around him.

634
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,860
Since when did I start
trusting him like this?

635
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,699
Well, shall we watch TV?

636
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,070
- Do you have a TV?
- Yes.

637
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,039
I rarely watch it, so I shoved it
into my closet...

638
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,510
Well, I'm just storing it
here for now.

639
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,949
Why is your TV
underneath your blankets?

640
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,880
I rarely watch it.

641
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,949
This is... It's an old model,
so it's a little heavy.

642
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,090
I'll help you. Hang on.

643
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,719
It's old, so it's a bit heavy.

644
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,030
Where... This is...

645
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:54,760
This... Here...

646
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,599
We need to take out
what's on top... Gosh!

647
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,690
It's okay.
We don't have to watch TV.

648
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,489
What should we do
with this blanket?

649
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,199
Jung.

650
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:35,539
- Let's sleep now.
- What?

651
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:40,110
No, I meant...

652
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:42,639
that we should sleep now.

653
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,119
Okay, let's do that.

654
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:56,159
- This is for the floor.
- Okay.

655
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,829
You can use this blanket.

656
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,829
Here's your pillow.

657
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,909
Have a good sleep.
Please turn the light off.

658
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:12,840
Yes, sure.

659
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,750
Good night.

660
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,090
Yes. Sweet dreams.

661
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,300
You can't fall asleep?

662
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,369
What about you, Jung?

663
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:15,739
You keep tossing and turning,
so how could I fall asleep?

664
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:23,750
It's only 10:30pm.

665
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,289
Could you turn the light on?

666
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,460
Sure.

667
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,230
What should we do?

668
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:45,570
Well...

669
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:50,539
This is a photo album, isn't it?
Can I look?

670
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:53,139
Yes.

671
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,710
It's from when I was a kid.

672
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,190
- Is this you?
- Yes.

673
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,389
You were so cute.

674
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,130
Look how long your legs are here.

675
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,369
Your eyes were so big
when you were young.

676
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:21,539
Sorry?

677
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:24,539
- Nothing. Is this your dad?
- Yes.

678
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,150
Look at your curly hair.

679
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,679
Doesn't it look like
triangle gimbap?

680
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:34,150
My hair was so much
curlier back then.

681
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,250
- It's definitely not as curly now.
- Yes, you're right.

682
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,420
See if you can
find me in this photo.

683
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,460
- You got it.
- This is you, right?

684
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,199
You still look the same.

685
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,210
I guess you and Joon were
close when you were younger.

686
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:03,079
Well, we're still close.

687
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:07,750
But Joon is a bit spoiled.

688
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:12,849
Since he was a kid, he could do
whatever he wanted.

689
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:17,130
He knows how to talk to my parents
and act charming,

690
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,860
so my parents always...

691
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,260
I think they always
just forgave him.

692
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,630
They're always so understanding
towards Joon.

693
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,639
There are people like that.

694
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,110
Those who get loved easily.

695
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,340
But I don't know.

696
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,949
It's not like I can become
like him if I try.

697
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,019
When I was young, I thought...

698
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,690
I wasn't smart enough.

699
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,559
So I always tried
my very best in everything.

700
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,360
Naturally, the results were good
because I worked hard.

701
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,130
I still feel the same way.

702
00:49:56,969 --> 00:49:58,929
That's why I always do my best.

703
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:02,539
But over time,

704
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,610
it's almost become a habit,

705
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,340
and I started taking
the results for granted.

706
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,550
So even when I make
a small mistake,

707
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,119
I beat myself up.

708
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,960
This is depressing, isn't it?

709
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,159
I'm like that too.

710
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:27,860
Really?

711
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,659
My dad is...

712
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,739
very warm and understanding
towards other people,

713
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,440
but he had very specific
expectations of me,

714
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,039
which I had to fulfil.

715
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:43,710
I had to be friendly at all times.
I couldn't get angry.

716
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,010
Well, he didn't exactly force me
to behave like that.

717
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,559
At times, I feel very frustrated.

718
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,130
Seol.

719
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:10,269
If I were your parent, I would've
been very affectionate towards you.

720
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,639
You always do your best.

721
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,449
I really respect that.

722
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,590
Don't worry.
You're doing a great job now.

723
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,989
"You're doing a great job."

724
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:33,929
"You're doing a great job."

725
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,570
I've always wanted to
hear that from someone.

726
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:49,579
Jung.

727
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,250
What did you like about me?

728
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Sorry?

729
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,320
Well, we weren't really
close before.

730
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:00,090
I actually thought you hated me.

731
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,519
I did.

732
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,829
Right.

733
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,460
When did you start feeling
differently about me, then?

734
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
Well...

735
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,099
You did the least amount of work
for the research,

736
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,510
so you should do the presentation.

737
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:18,840
You only wrote the introduction.
I wrote the rest.

738
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,539
Listen. Seol is the one
who edited it and put it together.

739
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,309
Do you really think you've
done more work than me?

740
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,550
Stop it. I'll just do it.

741
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:30,750
I put together the presentation
materials anyway.

742
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,059
I'll be fine if I go over
the materials a few times.

743
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,789
Seol, will you do that for us?

744
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,929
- I feel bad though.
- Come to think of it, you...

745
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,059
Seol is exactly like you.

746
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,300
- What do you mean by that?
- You two are so similar.

747
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,800
All right. I'll get going now.

748
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:51,610
Don't leave yet, Sang Cheol.
You have to put up the posters.

749
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:55,139
I helped with other things.

750
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:58,010
Those who didn't show up today
should do it.

751
00:52:58,449 --> 00:52:59,949
Why do I have to do all the work?
You should go home too.

752
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:02,920
Gosh, I'm hungry.

753
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,789
Goodness,
he's acting like that again.

754
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,360
We'll distribute the flyers.

755
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,829
Can you put up the posters
and the stickers?

756
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,099
Putting those up will take long,
so let's do it together.

757
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,369
These flyers...
We can distribute them tomorrow.

758
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,869
Gosh, I have a plan too.

759
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,699
You should thank me for
helping you with the flyers.

760
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:25,340
But this event is tomorrow.

761
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,739
Okay.
I'll put up the posters with Seol.

762
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:30,309
You said that you weren't
feeling well.

763
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:31,380
It looks like you have a bad cold.
Let's just go.

764
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,679
I'm okay. We'll finish up here,
so don't worry.

765
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:35,750
Then Min Soo,
you should come with me.

766
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,730
You should go home too.

767
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:48,230
You won't bump into anyone
if you go through the back gate.

768
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,369
I have to put up the posters.

769
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,900
I can take care of it.

770
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,710
Just go home.

771
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,849
No one will acknowledge
your hard work.

772
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,750
I know that I may look foolish,

773
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,860
but I don't care whether
I get acknowledged or not.

774
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,630
I'm doing this because I prefer
taking care of everything myself.

775
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,199
Aren't you the same way?

776
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:32,070
Why is he sleeping here?

777
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,650
Tell me.
When did you start liking me?

778
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,250
I'm not sure.

779
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,449
It's a secret.

780
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,860
What are you doing?

781
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:39,960
What about you?
You used to hate me too.

782
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:42,659
Yes. I did.

783
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,630
I thought of taking time off
from school because of you.

784
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,610
That's why I felt so uneasy about
getting the scholarship...

785
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:51,909
because of you.

786
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,840
But all of a sudden, you started
asking me to eat with you.

787
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,179
You startled me so many times.

788
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:03,320
You showed up
out of nowhere to help me.

789
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:07,059
You asked me to go for food with you
at every mealtime.

790
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,420
Then you asked me out
all of a sudden.

791
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,429
And all of a sudden,
I couldn't get a hold of you.

792
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,730
To be very honest,

793
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:22,739
I still can't believe that you're
here with me now.

794
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,210
So what do you think now?

795
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,210
You don't hate me any more?

796
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,420
I'm not sure how...

797
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,349
we ended up here
sitting together side by side.

798
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,989
But if I'm happy at this moment,

799
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,460
that should be enough, right?

800
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,730
I'll keep it as a secret too.

801
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:55,940
Let's really sleep now.

802
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,739
All right.

803
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:00,539
- Turn the light off, please.
- Okay.

804
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:07,550
- Have a good sleep.
- You too.

805
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,619
Gosh, are you okay?

806
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,360
- Are you okay?
- Gosh, yes. I'm okay.

807
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,090
I'm okay.

808
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,400
You hit your head pretty hard.

809
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:23,099
I'm okay.
I'm going to get some sleep.

810
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,840
So Hong Seol goes here...

811
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,239
What? This jerk. This is him.

812
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:37,110
He's at the same institute
Seol goes to?

813
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:41,050
All right.

814
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:43,920
Then I shall teach him
a lesson first.

815
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,460
I'd like to let you all
know about...

816
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:51,460
what one of the instructors
did to me.

817
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,230
Hong Seol, just wait
until the semester starts.

818
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,469
I'll reveal everything about
that jerk, Yu Jung.

819
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,710
Our website turned into a mess...

820
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,340
because of you.

821
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,280
Well, why?

822
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:10,110
Why did you beat up a student
of another institute?

823
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,579
You shouldn't forget that
your face is in our advertisements.

824
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:16,719
Well, he's saying that
he won't report you to the police,

825
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,820
but we have no choice.

826
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,090
We'll have to let you go, but
we'll pay you for the full month.

827
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:29,260
Okay. Well...

828
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,170
Thank you for everything you've
done for me. I had fun working here.

829
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,340
Well, then.

830
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,539
I'm sorry.

831
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:43,539
It's okay.

832
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,650
Take care.

833
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:49,650
- Don't push me!
- I want to see too!

834
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,050
What's going on?
What are you kids doing here?

835
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,289
- Why are you here?
- No! Don't go!

836
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,460
- Go, kids! Go now!
- No! No!

837
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:01,130
- Go now! Go.
- No!

838
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,039
Gosh, these kids...

839
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,739
- I have to go now.
- No!

840
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,409
It happened because of me.
I'll talk to the director.

841
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:20,849
No, don't even bother.
I was going to leave Seoul anyway.

842
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,480
It happened at the perfect timing.

843
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,650
Why?

844
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,820
Well...

845
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,190
I never stay at one place
for a long time.

846
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,360
Right. If that rat shows up again,
just avoid him.

847
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,039
I won't be here to protect you.
Got it?

848
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,440
So you won't come here any more?

849
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:52,349
Why are you looking at me like that?

850
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:56,050
What is it? Are you sad?

851
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,849
Are you sad that the handsome
Baek In Ho is leaving?

852
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,090
I guess you're actually sad.
You look like you're about to cry.

853
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,929
I know this because
I've dated many girls.

854
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,230
Girls like you
look ugly when they cry.

855
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,469
Okay? So...

856
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,710
Who's about to cry?
I'm not sad at all.

857
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,210
Good to know.

858
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:27,980
Take care.

859
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:13,559
It looks like you two have gotten
very close during the break.

860
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,659
- We're dating.
- I need to buy sunglasses.

861
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,329
I've gotten too famous
to even walk around the campus.

862
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:21,440
- Be quiet.
- Seol. It's me, Min Soo.

863
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:23,500
But your style looks
a lot like Seol's now.

864
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,039
- Who wants a part-time job?
- Me!

865
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,239
Do you want to play the piano?

866
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,239
I had no idea then
what giving up a dream...

867
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,949
meant to me.

868
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,110
Those two ended up dating.

869
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,050
Why did that jerk, Jung,
make me approach Hong Seol?

870
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,719
It was because of me, so it's okay.

871
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,989
That crazy pervert.
He's still not caught?

872
01:03:41,019 --> 01:03:44,530
I'm going to show you
what kind of jerk your boyfriend is.

873
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,559
Seol.

874
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,130
Jung.
