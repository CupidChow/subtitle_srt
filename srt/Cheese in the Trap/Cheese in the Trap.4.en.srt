00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,139
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,609
You should've been careful.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,519
Shall we eat together?

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,489
Get a grip, Hong Seol.
Don't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,690
- Mad Hair.
- Are you insane?

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,800
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,399
- It's a great idea.
- Isn't it?

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,670
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,609
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,820
This is it. Thanks for
walking me home.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,820
Thanks for walking me home.

12
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,859
I should go inside.

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,439
Seol.

14
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,609
Yes?

15
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,980
Would you be my girlfriend?

16
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,150
What's your answer?

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,819
I don't know why you said that.

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,829
Are you sure?

19
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,359
Yes.

20
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,170
And I never thought that...
I would or could start dating anyone.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,739
I see.

22
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,170
No, it's...

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,739
It's not because I don't like you.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,109
- It's because...
- Then say yes.

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,079
I think you should.

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,719
Say yes. Will you?

27
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,299
- Okay?
- Okay.

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,740
Good.

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,169
Go inside. It's late.

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,139
Okay.

31
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,879
No way. It can't be.

32
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,650
It can't be.

33
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,259
Let's start from terminology.

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,569
This is just insane!

35
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,169
No way.

36
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,740
This is just crazy. It's crazy!

37
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,479
- It's crazy.
- Forget it.

38
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,379
I really wasn't going to
drink tonight.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,050
Why would he...

40
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,060
No way. It's unbelievable.
It doesn't make sense.

41
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,960
Why would he ask me out?

42
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,159
There's no way he likes me.

43
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,069
Right.

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,669
There's nothing to show that
he liked you.

45
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,169
But still.

46
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,840
Why would he ask her out
if he doesn't like her?

47
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,840
Think about how he was last year.

48
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,080
He completely ignored you
and now he suddenly likes you?

49
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,919
He's up to something.

50
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,590
Yes. It doesn't feel right.

51
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,419
Why on earth did you nod?

52
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:13,759
I wonder why.

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,790
Why did I nod?

54
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,740
(Episode 4)

55
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,459
How do I face him?

56
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,629
What do I tell the others?

57
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,740
It's the holidays.

58
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,550
That's right. It's the holidays.

59
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,579
He'll be busy.

60
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,420
What a relief.

61
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,329
- The semester is over.
- Yes!

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,730
What am I to say when we meet up?

63
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,470
I hope he doesn't act
any differently.

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,970
Jung...

65
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,370
Seol. See you.

66
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,480
- Jung, let's go.
- Okay.

67
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,279
Jung.

68
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,879
Hi.

69
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,750
- What do you want to eat?
- I'm starving.

70
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,089
- I am so hungry.
- What should we eat?

71
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,259
What was that about?
He's the one who asked me out.

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,959
I didn't expect anything grand,

73
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,660
but not this, either.

74
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,769
What's he thinking?
Is he regretting?

75
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,699
- That's for me to do.
- Exactly.

76
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,339
You should try harder.

77
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,579
- Sorry.
- 4.3 GPA.

78
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,480
Most students get that.

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,879
No club activities, internships
or experience studying abroad.

80
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,819
830 TOEIC score?
Barely good enough to graduate.

81
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,350
You didn't even take the
speaking test.

82
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,259
Not yet.

83
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,529
What do you want to do
after you graduate?

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,629
Why do you study Business?

85
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,370
What is your dream?

86
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,970
What dream?

87
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,279
I can't afford to learn a language.

88
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,649
Forget language courses.

89
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,350
I need to save up for
next semester's tuition.

90
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,949
The scholarship went out the window.

91
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,560
Do I need to apply for
leave of absence?

92
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,430
You lost the scholarship? How?

93
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,170
One of the professors
gave me a bad grade.

94
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:18,279
I was wondering if
you could...

95
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,910
Listen to yourself.

96
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,250
You're asking us for money
when you know we're strapped.

97
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,720
And whose fault is that?

98
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,949
When did you ever
pay for her tuition?

99
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,220
Why does a girl need to
spend that much to study?

100
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,730
The man takes care of the household.

101
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,759
That's my point. The men in your
family graduated universities.

102
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,329
I wonder what they're doing.

103
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,730
Mum.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,970
Gosh. Their heads are full of
nothing but hot air.

105
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,139
A million dollars?
10 million dollars?

106
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,839
Don't you even mention
starting another business.

107
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,740
- What if I do mention it?
- My goodness.

108
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,680
Women know nothing about business!

109
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,720
I lost out because you wouldn't stop
nagging and complaining!

110
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,089
You're the one who
threw away our savings!

111
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,759
Mum.

112
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,529
- Again?
- Yes.

113
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,829
He did it again. He was so sure
he could make a fortune.

114
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,399
We have no income at all.

115
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,139
Thanks for the food.

116
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,879
- How is it?
- It's good.

117
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,350
Good. Do you think...

118
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,450
I could sell this?

119
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,450
Will you sell noodles?

120
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,950
Someone has to do something.

121
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,690
We're this close to losing our home.

122
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,029
I know that you're in trouble
but what about Joon?

123
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,759
If your dad insisted on
sending him abroad,

124
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,700
then he should support him.

125
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,539
What am I supposed to do
if he doesn't support Joon?

126
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,940
Seol, how about...

127
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,610
you move back home?

128
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,610
We'll see if we can scrape together
for you and Joon.

129
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,080
We live far from your university,

130
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,149
but you can't take
another leave of absence.

131
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,720
Okay.

132
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,860
I didn't like this place anyway.

133
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,139
All these stairs
only make my legs thicker.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,470
And my neighbour gets upset about
almost anything.

135
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,139
And this door always gets stuck.

136
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,279
Yes.

137
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,750
It's for the better.

138
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,159
The room's too small,
almost suffocating.

139
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,929
Hot in the summer,
cold in the winter.

140
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,429
The walls are so thin.

141
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,440
All my mum gives me is kimchi.

142
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,340
A four-hour round trip is worth...

143
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,039
having homemade meals.

144
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,779
It's for the better.

145
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:14,919
I feel much better.

146
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,600
Why doesn't Jung call me?

147
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,139
Are all couples like this?

148
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,210
How would I know?

149
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,049
I should ask Ah Young.

150
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,649
She went backpacking.

151
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,820
I can't ask Bo Ra.

152
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,730
Forget it.

153
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,769
It's not like I ever
cared about these things.

154
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,940
Post-exam feast is on me.
It's expensive, so show up or regret it.

155
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,750
I think it's time to
fill my stomach.

156
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,690
Gosh. This is so awkward
and frustrating.

157
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,529
Let's just go back to how we were.

158
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm sorry about last time. I was
worried about grades...

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,139
and scholarship. I couldn't
think about anything else.

160
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:44,779
I'm a bit too shy
to talk about myself.

161
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,049
I'll try from now on.
I'll say so if something's wrong...

162
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,679
No. I didn't mean you should
talk about everything.

163
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,950
I thought I was your closest friend,

164
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,820
and I know nothing about you.

165
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,730
I didn't like that at all.

166
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,629
- Bo Ra.
- Sorry, Seol.

167
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,429
I'll try to complain less.

168
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,470
Let's try to be more honest.

169
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,840
I'll be more honest.

170
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,649
Seol.

171
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,250
Dear friend.

172
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,919
Stop clasping hands and take these.

173
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,990
I was worried we'd come all the way
and not get to eat this.

174
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,330
You should have
piled the food.

175
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,100
Stop talking and let's dig in.

176
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,899
- Let's eat.
- Thanks for the food.

177
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh. I saw Jung on campus today.

178
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,409
Really? Where?

179
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,580
- Outside the building.
- Isn't he on holiday?

180
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,549
- Did he say anything?
- No.

181
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,149
Why? Do you have business with him?

182
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,049
No. Why would I?

183
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,090
Eun Taek, you saw us.

184
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,230
She held my hands and said
she'd be more honest.

185
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,629
I did and I think she's trying.

186
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,429
Give her a little more time.

187
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,639
Do you know any kids
who need tutoring?

188
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,940
- No.
- I need to work.

189
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:26,240
We're still waiting, you know.

190
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,549
- Well...
- Keep going.

191
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,149
Jung asked me out.

192
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,690
Stop talking nonsense
and get to the point.

193
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,059
It's true!

194
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,860
I don't know why he asked me out,

195
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,330
but he did and
I haven't heard from him since.

196
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,230
I'm not sure if I should
contact him first.

197
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm really confused.
What should I do?

198
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

199
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,470
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Even I can't believe it.

200
00:13:57,909 --> 00:13:59,039
What's going on?

201
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,179
I told you I sensed something
between them, didn't I?

202
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,220
Hey. Go back to the very beginning.

203
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,379
Stop eating and start talking.

204
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,450
That's it.

205
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,090
What should I do?

206
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,519
When did he start liking you?

207
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,730
You two didn't exactly
get along that great at first.

208
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,429
What do you think he sees in Seol?

209
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,129
I don't see any endearing qualities.

210
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:26,340
Don't say that.

211
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:29,139
She's dependable.
She's very dependable.

212
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,409
- She is.
- She's dependable.

213
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:36,509
So are you...

214
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,649
Is it him?

215
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,889
- Hello?
- Do you need a job?

216
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,059
Mr. Heo?

217
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:53,259
- Work at the office?
- Yes or no, I need an answer.

218
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,870
Why did you call me about it?

219
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,100
Is that a no? Don't complain later.

220
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,370
No, I'm in. I'll do it.

221
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,009
Monday, 9am. Don't you dare be late.

222
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,480
Why did she have to say yes?

223
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,049
Did Mr. Heo just hire you?

224
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,919
- Yes.
- That's awesome.

225
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,960
It's an amazing opportunity.
How did this happen?

226
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,919
Don't they usually
accept applications?

227
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,029
Why did Mr. Heo call you?

228
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,330
- Maybe he liked her attitude.
- Exactly.

229
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,929
- Are you jealous?
- That hurts.

230
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,730
- I'm off.
- Already?

231
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,200
Give Jung a call.

232
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,539
Tell him you got a job and...

233
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,370
ask about his holiday plans.

234
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,409
Dating is all about timing.
Just go for it, okay?

235
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,919
You know everything, so why couldn't
you find a date for yourself?

236
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,090
I didn't, not couldn't.
You don't know me at all.

237
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,590
Seol seems to be in
a budding relationship,

238
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,330
so how about you consider...

239
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,029
- what I suggested last time?
- I'm done talking to you.

240
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,460
Bye.

241
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,730
Am I that charmless?

242
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm working at the faculty office
over the holiday.

243
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,179
What will you be doing
during the break?

244
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,509
Send?

245
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,090
Send. Gosh, I sent it.
I sent it.

246
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,860
One, two...

247
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,639
Six.

248
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,210
Okay. Good for you.

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,350
Enjoy your holiday.

250
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:58,720
Then he won't see me
over the holidays?

251
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,700
What kind of relationship is this?

252
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,640
The holidays began.

253
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,980
The faculty office is open
from 9am to 5pm.

254
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,750
It is a great job but...

255
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,250
there's one problem.

256
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,990
Good morning.

257
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,329
You're late. Why are you so late?

258
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:37,529
Come over here.

259
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,130
Move faster.

260
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,970
Didn't I tell you to arrive
10 minutes before office hours?

261
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,440
Do you think that little of me?

262
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,450
Don't be so mean.

263
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,109
It's not yet even 9am.

264
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,450
It's her first day.
She should've come on time.

265
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
Wash the cups.

266
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,720
- Go and wash the cups.
- Okay.

267
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,220
Your seat's over there.
Leave your bag and wash the cups.

268
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,589
Mr. Heo's a little odd.

269
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,829
I knew he was odd, but still.

270
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Good morning.

271
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,349
Why are you here so early?

272
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,750
Do you have time to kill?

273
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,650
Then just don't go home.

274
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,019
You can live here.

275
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,230
We should've done this long ago.

276
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,430
Sort these in alphabetical order.

277
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,430
Get to work.

278
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,950
Thank you.

279
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,259
- Lovely.
- Hey.

280
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,220
How'd you make this?

281
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,559
With a little less water,
just as you asked.

282
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,700
Coffee's best when it's cold.
Fill it up with ice.

283
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,569
You can't eat cold drinks.

284
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,670
I can. I drink iced coffee
with my food.

285
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,339
You just went to the toilet
and said...

286
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,079
- you have a stomach ache.
- No. Fill that up with ice.

287
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,349
It's only been a few days
and I'm exhausted already.

288
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,029
- Jung hasn't texted me since.
- Hang on.

289
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,930
Are you checking your phone?

290
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,029
- Do you want me to do something?
- People might think...

291
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,569
all I do is to boss you around.

292
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,839
- Remember, you're here to work.
- Jung.

293
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,980
What are you doing here?

294
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,009
Jung.

295
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,519
Why are you here?

296
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,420
To see Seol.

297
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,990
Seol?

298
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,619
Are you two dating or something?

299
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:20,619
Are you?

300
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,059
Really?

301
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,799
- Yes.
- No way.

302
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:28,329
Unbelievable. I'm jealous now.

303
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,500
- Are you doing okay?
- Yes.

304
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,099
I brought some snacks.

305
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you.

306
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,910
Can I borrow Seol for a while?

307
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,140
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

308
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,509
Go on.

309
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,150
I'll be right back.

310
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,259
Thanks for everything, Mr. Heo.

311
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,430
That was nothing, really.

312
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,259
I'm taking the summer session.
I'll come by often.

313
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,170
- Have fun.
- Let's go.

314
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,099
- Take your time, Seol.
- Okay.

315
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,450
Does this mean I have to see him
every day?

316
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,250
Is the work hard?

317
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,990
Not really.

318
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,220
Didn't you miss me?

319
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,190
You never called, so I missed you.

320
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,269
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

321
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,400
Why?

322
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,240
I thought...

323
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,109
The last text you sent me...

324
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:48,549
sounded like you didn't want to
see me until next semester.

325
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,119
I just meant what I said
and nothing more.

326
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,519
Gosh. What's wrong with me?

327
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,019
I feel terrible.

328
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:04,390
I didn't think
you'd take it that way. Sorry.

329
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,859
No, I should apologise.
I misunderstood.

330
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,240
This is actually...

331
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,309
my first time dating someone, so...

332
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,049
Seol, are you free this weekend?

333
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,309
Shall we go on a date?

334
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,289
A date?

335
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,329
Wear something cute.

336
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,599
Something cute?

337
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,099
Your face is so gloomy.

338
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,509
Why are all my clothes so dreary?

339
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,839
Yes.

340
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
This is it.

341
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,420
Perfect.

342
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,259
Mad Hair.

343
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,900
Mad Hair.

344
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:16,700
What a mess.

345
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,910
(Receipt: Tuition refunded)

346
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,809
(Credit Card Statement)

347
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,410
In Ha really knows how to spend.

348
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm not even surprised.

349
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,960
Hello, Father.

350
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,400
I have something to tell you.

351
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,400
I got a call from the institute.

352
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,410
In Ha cancelled the course
and got a refund.

353
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,710
I think you should stop
supporting her financially.

354
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,420
She'll only grow up
when she realises her predicament.

355
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:10,150
Okay.

356
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,500
See you at the box office at 2pm.

357
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:46,119
Mad Hair, where are you headed?

358
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,490
- When's our dinner?
- Not today.

359
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,289
Then when?

360
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,200
Don't you ever do anything?
You just hang around.

361
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,200
"Just hang around"?
I just got back from a job-search.

362
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:58,869
I'm not hanging around.

363
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,769
Do you dress like that
for interviews?

364
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,009
- Why not?
- You look like a punk.

365
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,710
- A punk?
- Look.

366
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,309
You go to interviews
hoping to make a good impression.

367
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,480
Don't wear T-shirts. Wear
a long-sleeved shirt with a collar.

368
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,619
Open just one button at the top.

369
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,259
And you can't wear trousers
with holes in them. Dress up.

370
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,990
Black or navy will do.

371
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,390
Bare feet? That's career suicide.

372
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,900
I don't think anyone got a job
after a bare-foot interview.

373
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,400
What about you, then?

374
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:31,069
You're in no position
to comment on my outfit.

375
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,269
- What? Me?
- Are you an old lady?

376
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,009
You're dressed like one.

377
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,509
This is my cutest outfit.

378
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,910
Cute... Are you dressed like this
because I told you to look cute?

379
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,579
Gosh. I had no idea
I had that much influence on you.

380
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:50,319
This isn't cute. This is ugly.

381
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,519
I do hope you aren't
off to see a guy.

382
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:55,990
You can't be. Right?

383
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,859
Dressed like this?

384
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,500
It can't be. That's just wrong.

385
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:03,799
Hey...

386
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:06,369
Hey.

387
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,470
You look horribly old from behind.

388
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,970
I'm sorry I'm late.

389
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,809
It's okay. I just got here.

390
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,180
You look pretty.

391
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,309
I'm my usual self.

392
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:54,019
The tickets...
You bought them already.

393
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,319
Do you want popcorn? I'll buy some.

394
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,890
I have a coupon.

395
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,990
We get four dollars off.

396
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,329
Cheese or onion. Which flavour?

397
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,670
What's wrong? Does he not know
what coupons are?

398
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,740
We still have some time to kill.

399
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:18,410
Shall we go to a cafe?

400
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,279
We haven't got much time.
It's just a waste of money.

401
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,349
I'll explain.

402
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,490
Step on the pedal to walk and
take your foot off to hide.

403
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:32,990
Shake the gun a few times to reload,

404
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,190
and to change weapons you click
1, 2, 3, 4 times to...

405
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,759
You need to play
to get the gist of it, so have a go.

406
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,799
Shoot. That's it.

407
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,769
Wow.

408
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,240
You're incredible.

409
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,410
No way! You just broke the record.

410
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,609
Are you sure
this is your first time?

411
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,650
You next.

412
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,619
Such bad timing. High-five.

413
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,650
It's so awkward.

414
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,420
What?

415
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,460
You're the one
who bought me all that, remember?

416
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,299
Why should I give it back?
I got that for putting up with you.

417
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,069
- Miss.
- Don't ever call me again.

418
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,400
If you do,
I'll call the cops.

419
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,269
What?

420
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,039
This card has been suspended.

421
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,710
This is just unbelievable.

422
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,119
This is suspended, too.

423
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,619
Did you swipe it right?

424
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,690
It worked perfectly fine yesterday,
so why...

425
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,069
No...

426
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,230
Mr. Yu.

427
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:54,799
Why did you suspend
all my credit cards?

428
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,609
How can a single woman survive
without any money?

429
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,049
In Ha, I said I'd give you a job
once you get a licence.

430
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:05,349
Others would do anything
to get a job.

431
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,680
Why won't you work?

432
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,190
Licence exams
are just too difficult.

433
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,190
You know I'm not smart.

434
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,890
If that's what you think,
try that much harder.

435
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,799
You're an adult.

436
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,599
You should have a job.

437
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:24,430
I need to pay to take classes.

438
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,299
Will you pay for the tuition?

439
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,609
Just for the first month.
And no more refunds. I warned them.

440
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,609
- I'll check on your attendance.
- What?

441
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,309
Jung thinks you should study...

442
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,779
and he asked me to help you grow up.

443
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,789
- Jung?
- Now you know how much we care.

444
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,289
Good luck on improving yourself
and finding a job.

445
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,660
Jung?

446
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,059
Jung, that jerk!

447
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:58,170
Why is he trying to force us apart?

448
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,569
What did I do?
All I did was spend money!

449
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,210
So why? Why?

450
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,819
It's boring. Let's go.

451
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,160
We have different tastes in movies.

452
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:26,200
I prefer action movies.

453
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,170
Are you bored?

454
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,900
No, it's interesting.

455
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,000
Don't you want any?

456
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:38,170
No. You can finish it.

457
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:49,619
(Baek In Ha)

458
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,390
You can take the call.

459
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,490
No, I don't have to.

460
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
Is the food here made with gold?

461
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,799
Everything's so expensive.

462
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,170
Jung.

463
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,410
We don't have to eat here.

464
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,309
Is it too formal?

465
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,809
The food's good, though.

466
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,119
What's the cheapest thing here?

467
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,160
This. This one.

468
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,490
- Have you decided?
- Yes.

469
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,299
This costs over 10 dollars?

470
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,369
He must be used to places like this.

471
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,880
Is that enough? Have some of this.

472
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,710
No, it's fine.

473
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,950
Don't you eat meat?

474
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,319
I had too much popcorn earlier.

475
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:55,750
You need something to drink.
Let's have some wine.

476
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,420
What? I'm really fine.

477
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,000
- This one.
- Sure.

478
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,609
I think a 15-dollar soup
is way too much,

479
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,980
but he orders wine
like it's nothing.

480
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,019
I want to go home.

481
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,460
You have a nice build
and you look pretty strong.

482
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,289
You can start tomorrow.

483
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,259
Perfect.

484
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,660
- Su Hee.
- Sir.

485
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,029
- Who's he?
- Our new cleaner.

486
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,140
Hello, I'm Baek In Ho.

487
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,069
You're too good-looking
just to clean up.

488
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,049
They paid me this much
for taking a few photos?

489
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,619
Are they that rich?

490
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,890
Mad Hair was actually right.

491
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,190
Clothes make the man.

492
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,960
- Hello?
- Hey, got any cash?

493
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:19,799
How did you know?

494
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:25,240
My goodness.
Why is he dressed up like that?

495
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,940
That look really disgusts me.

496
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,910
- You hate shirts. Got a date?
- What is it?

497
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,720
The cash. Hand it over.

498
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,279
Is it yours?

499
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,690
Do you think I want to
spend your money?

500
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,619
Jung talked to his dad...
and had him suspend my credit cards.

501
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,829
I knew something was off
when he told me to get a licence.

502
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,799
They must've known I'd say no,

503
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,599
but now they're actually
cornering me.

504
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,900
I have nothing to live off of.

505
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,509
What if I end up starving to death?

506
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,509
Don't you have any cash?

507
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,809
I don't even have enough
to get home.

508
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,210
Give me some.

509
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:10,849
Listen.

510
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,690
This is it.

511
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,599
Will you get a grip?

512
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,800
How long do you think
they'll put up with you?

513
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,030
Jung had your credit cards suspended
so he can get rid of us.

514
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,840
It's not me. It's you.

515
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:32,809
All you have to do is forget about
your pride and bow to them.

516
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,610
I told you never to say that.

517
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,820
If you don't want to do that,
then disappear again.

518
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,719
You already disappeared once.
You can do it again.

519
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,820
Hey. You...

520
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,030
That brat.

521
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,199
Does Mr. Heo give you a hard time?

522
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,940
You know he can be mean.

523
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,710
It's not like I wasn't aware.

524
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,349
I wanted to study English
in my free time,

525
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,619
but there's too much to do.

526
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:17,119
- English?
- Yes.

527
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,590
I talked to a career consultant and
she said I need to brush up...

528
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,289
my English speaking skills.

529
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,000
Well... I can introduce you to a
friend who is running an academy.

530
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,159
He gives my friends discounts.

531
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,469
No thanks.

532
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,699
You won't have time
during the semester.

533
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,670
Why not study now?

534
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,909
You have a point
but this holiday...

535
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,510
Is it somewhere here?

536
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,980
Yes. Just over there.

537
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,230
What's he doing? It can't be.

538
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,230
I'd rather not.
He doesn't have to...

539
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,579
Thanks for everything today.
Drive safe.

540
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,710
Okay.

541
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,050
I'll wait till you go in.

542
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,619
Okay.

543
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,750
I'm so tired.

544
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,059
Are all dates this exhausting?

545
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:13,170
It's just so uncomfortable.

546
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:20,309
I'm starving.

547
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,650
I need food.

548
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,320
Food...

549
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,699
Please leave a message...

550
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,510
You aren't even picking up?

551
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,739
Fine. Let's see
who's more persistent.

552
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,250
I won't stop calling
until you pick up.

553
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,699
Where are you? Let's meet up.

554
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,500
- What for?
- Did you suspend her credit cards?

555
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,699
You should've waited
until she found a job.

556
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,239
I warned you.

557
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,710
I told you to stay away.

558
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,909
What?

559
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,480
Hey. Hey!

560
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,510
- This jerk...
- Hello.

561
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,860
Did he tell me to stay
away because of her?

562
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,760
I don't want to stay away.
Tough luck.

563
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,219
What kind of a girl eats so much
late at night?

564
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,119
Are you a wrestler?

565
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,920
Hello.

566
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,960
Why don't you buy some kimchi?

567
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,159
I want some but I'm 50 cents short.

568
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,500
Instant noodles without kimchi
is like a cream-less cream puff...

569
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,000
and a barbecue without meat and...

570
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,170
a salad without vegetables,
What other examples are there?

571
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:29,670
Food at last.

572
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,210
Thanks for the food.

573
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,420
Don't eat it. It's mine.

574
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,119
I paid for it.

575
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,019
You gave me the money,
so I'm the rightful owner.

576
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,519
- Let's share.
- Take half exactly.

577
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,489
That's too much.

578
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,530
Hang on.

579
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,900
You look much nicer.

580
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,869
So do you.

581
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,539
Did you find a job?

582
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,269
Yes, thanks to you.

583
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,219
Are you ambidextrous?

584
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,760
That's weird.

585
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,030
Is it?

586
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,630
I used to be left-handed but
became like this after an accident.

587
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,369
The accident...

588
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,010
was Jung's fault.

589
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,449
You mean...

590
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,719
Jung hurt your hand?

591
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,659
You'd never guess
from the way he acts.

592
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,989
Watch out.

593
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,960
I won't help out if you end up
getting betrayed.

594
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:13,039
Father.

595
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,480
Did In Ha call you?

596
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:22,150
Yes. Don't go too hard on her.

597
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,550
Even a bridled horse
will throw you off...

598
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,119
if you pull too hard.

599
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,260
Okay.

600
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,829
Don't worry too much about her.
I'll sort things out.

601
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:38,030
Okay, then.

602
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,369
That kimchi didn't count, okay?

603
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,010
You owe me a meal.

604
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,650
I barely live
from hand to mouth myself.

605
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,190
You work in
an air-conditioned office.

606
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,519
How hard could that be?

607
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,619
I'd rather do work
that's physically hard.

608
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,829
I get told off for whatever I do.

609
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,829
I get told off whether
I make a mistake or not.

610
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:12,199
I still get told off whether I
bring them the coffee or not.

611
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,139
Do you just put up with everything?

612
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,909
I did think you'd be
the frustrating type.

613
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,750
"No, it's okay. Sure, I'll do it."

614
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,750
"I'll try harder next time."
Isn't that what you always say?

615
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,090
If you keep acting like that, you
will become nothing but a pushover.

616
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,829
The society we live in...

617
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,730
I don't know much but
you won't get anywhere like that.

618
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,730
I'm telling you the truth.

619
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,570
Show your gratitude with food.

620
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,239
What shall we eat? How about beef?

621
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,039
You and your beef.

622
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:00,079
Hey, my biggest cause of stress
is you leeching off me.

623
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,349
I don't owe you any money,
so stop acting like I do, okay?

624
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,829
Exactly. That's how
you should react.

625
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,159
Bye.

626
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,139
Weirdo.

627
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,710
I'm stuffed. I feel good.

628
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,050
He doesn't seem like a bad guy.

629
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,360
What happened between them?

630
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,440
Can he hear me?

631
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,380
I called my friend who
runs the academy. Drop by one day.

632
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:05,449
He's really determined.

633
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,719
Am I allowed to accept all this?

634
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,530
Thank you.

635
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:23,829
I had a good time today.

636
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:29,510
I feel bad that
you paid for everything.

637
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,639
I'll treat you next time.

638
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,650
Okay. Sleep well.

639
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,349
You, too.

640
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,289
Good night.

641
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:52,690
Is that the right thing to say?

642
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:57,530
It feels so weird.

643
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,909
- Free?
- It's Hong Seol...

644
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,170
It's not just a discount?

645
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:08,940
No. We got special instructions
from the top.

646
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,320
Thank you.

647
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,619
Will you register or not?

648
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,889
I'll come back.

649
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,699
You look familiar.

650
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,610
Mad Hair, what are you doing here?

651
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:44,250
Do you study here?

652
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,480
Why...

653
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,650
I got a job, remember?
I work here...

654
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,849
as a model and teaching assistant.

655
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,619
I run on errands, too.

656
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,429
Why do we keep
bumping into each other?

657
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,829
We could meet up for food or snacks.

658
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,730
I'm so glad I got the job.

659
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,699
Congratulations.
You should get back to work.

660
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:08,800
I will. See you around.

661
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,940
You'll see me every day.

662
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,380
Why did he have to get a job there?

663
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,079
Is he doing this on purpose?

664
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,849
- Thanks. Thanks for fixing it.
- No worries.

665
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

666
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:26,559
He's the landlady's grandson.
Say hello.

667
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

668
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,329
How is your window?

669
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:33,630
Mine was too loose,
so I asked him to fix it...

670
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,929
and he did it right away.

671
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,429
Really? You must be handy.

672
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:38,599
Not really.

673
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,639
Why don't you have him
check your windows?

674
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,510
- I would like that.
- The room next door?

675
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,840
Sure, since I'm already here.

676
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,710
I heard that a pervert
has been breaking into flats.

677
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,019
It's best to take precautions,
especially since you're a lady.

678
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,150
Right.

679
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,250
- Thank you.
- Go on in.

680
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,920
- Are you an engineer?
- No.

681
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,530
An electrician, then?

682
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,000
- The window's over there.
- Okay.

683
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:14,800
Gosh. This is in bad shape.

684
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,340
Anyone could just pull it right off.

685
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,539
How about I flip my mattress?

686
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,639
- Oh, sure.
- I think that would help.

687
00:47:22,949 --> 00:47:24,679
- Hang on.
- So...

688
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,119
I'm not sure if
I can fix it properly.

689
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:28,550
I'm no expert.

690
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,150
Don't worry. I'm just glad
you're taking a look at it.

691
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,260
I don't have all the tools I need
but I'll try my best.

692
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,030
- I said I'd move out.
- Okay.

693
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,840
Can I leave before my contract ends?

694
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,639
I don't know all the details.

695
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,179
- I'll ask my grandmother.
- Okay.

696
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:02,449
Hello.

697
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,250
Hello?

698
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:07,760
I went by the academy.

699
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,630
They said the tuition's free.

700
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,760
I wasn't aware of that.
That's a huge favour, then.

701
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,969
It is and...

702
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,940
I don't like the idea of
taking classes for free.

703
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,340
Go and register.

704
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:27,079
- Are you at home?
- The landlady's grandson...

705
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:28,940
came by to check on the iron grille.

706
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,550
- Mr. Cho.
- Yes, Sir.

707
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,119
Can you not speak with a dialect?

708
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,650
This is how I speak
and it's hard to change.

709
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:39,150
You teach English
and your accent is...

710
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,130
Jung, what brings you here?

711
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,130
- Let's continue this later.
- Sure.

712
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,429
I owe you a visit and a favour.

713
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,469
You didn't have to
bring a gift, though.

714
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:57,739
Now why would you ask me
for a favour about a girl?

715
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,139
Who is she? Your girlfriend?

716
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:04,409
Keep it between us.
I haven't told my dad yet.

717
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,119
Do I get to meet her
before your father does?

718
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,019
What an honour.

719
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:11,719
How is your father doing?

720
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,320
- He's fine.
- What's wrong?

721
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,989
Do you know him?

722
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,000
Yes.

723
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:26,940
This is urgent. Finish it today.

724
00:49:26,969 --> 00:49:27,940
Here we go again.

725
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:29,039
Pardon?

726
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,210
Today?

727
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,480
There's too much.

728
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,380
All you have to do is
type it into an Excel file.

729
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:42,750
If you keep acting like that, you
will become nothing but a pushover.

730
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,760
Mr. Heo.

731
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,230
This is too much to finish
by the end of the day.

732
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,329
It's not just me. No one
would be able to finish it.

733
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,429
What's wrong with you today?
I said it's an urgent task.

734
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,539
Just do as you're told.

735
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,539
Are you talking about
the document...

736
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,980
that is due next week?

737
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,780
Yes, but the sooner
we have them done the better.

738
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,050
I'll do it as fast as I can.

739
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,250
Not by today, though.

740
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:20,920
What is she saying?

741
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,130
- Seol.
- Hello, Jung.

742
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,000
Thank you.

743
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,769
Get Seol out of here.

744
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,400
Buy her something delicious.

745
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,239
- Go on.
- Let's go.

746
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:38,070
- I won't be too long.
- Go on.

747
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:41,639
Drink this.

748
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,519
I owe you for
the free language classes.

749
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,489
How is it?

750
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,619
Are there any problems?

751
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:55,619
I shouldn't tell him
about In Ho, should I?

752
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,159
They don't get along
and it might just upset him.

753
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,260
No. Everything's fine.

754
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,530
Really? That's good to hear.

755
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,340
Why did you come by so early?

756
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:11,510
I wanted to see your face
before my lecture.

757
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,880
Why? Do you mind?

758
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,679
No.

759
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,250
I have to go now.
I'll call when I'm done.

760
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,619
Okay.

761
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:26,889
Everything's fine?

762
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,829
Why go abroad to take
language courses...

763
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,030
when you could
apply to be an exchange student?

764
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:37,500
- I'm just tired.
- How long will you be away?

765
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:39,699
A year at least.

766
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,070
- A year?
- Yes.

767
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,309
Weren't you and Jung close?

768
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,510
He was here just a while ago.

769
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,340
What for?

770
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,710
Why else? Him and Seol...

771
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,250
- Ms. Kim.
- What?

772
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:56,050
Was it a secret?

773
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:57,750
Sorry.

774
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:00,690
Can we talk?

775
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,090
I'm working.

776
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,800
I won't take too much of
your time. Let's talk.

777
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,840
What do you want to say?

778
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,170
You denied it all along
but you two ended up together.

779
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:21,679
We really weren't dating
at the time.

780
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:26,650
Things just happened,
so I hope you aren't disappointed.

781
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:31,449
I don't think I have
the right to complain.

782
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:35,719
- What?
- I need to tell you something.

783
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,230
To be honest...

784
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,230
I didn't like you from the start.

785
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,130
You took the top spot,

786
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,940
and then Jung talked about you
and looked out for you.

787
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,440
Ever since we fought over the
assignment,

788
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,639
he distanced himself from me.

789
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,949
So I sent a homeless guy to you.

790
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,150
Do you see the light
on the second floor?

791
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,750
Over there?

792
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:07,320
Yes. Go up there and you'll find...

793
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,090
a girl who is
willing to hear your story.

794
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:12,730
Do you even realise...

795
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:16,030
what you're talking about?

796
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,329
I didn't want you to get hurt.

797
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,739
I was worried,
so I went to see Jung.

798
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:24,840
I asked for his help.

799
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,409
I told him that
you were in danger...

800
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,679
but he just left.

801
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,090
What are you trying to say?

802
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,519
Jung didn't...

803
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,929
Does it even matter
whether he helped me or not?

804
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,000
What's important is that
you put me in danger.

805
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,099
Do you see the scar?

806
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:55,800
What if my face got hurt?

807
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,110
I'm apologising, aren't I?
It was hard on me, too.

808
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:01,539
What took you so long to apologise
if it made you feel that guilty?

809
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,510
You met me by chance
and now you're saying sorry?

810
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,019
You want to be the top student.
You want a boyfriend.

811
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,289
You want me gone,

812
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,619
and you want to apologise
just so you'll feel better...

813
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:16,190
while putting the blame on others.

814
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:20,630
Why are you so selfish
until the very end?

815
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,969
Okay, fine. I'm really sorry.

816
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:27,340
You aren't...

817
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,110
sorry at all.

818
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,849
Go. I have nothing more to hear.

819
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,519
Ju Yeon.

820
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,420
I don't want to see you again.

821
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:02,239
You're both the same.

822
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,980
Keep your arm up. Don't put it down.

823
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,949
Where on earth did
the homeless man come from?

824
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:14,750
I'm late.

825
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,250
What are you doing here?

826
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,360
I called security.

827
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,630
You shouldn't have gone too far.

828
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,030
I'm here because I was worried.

829
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,670
I didn't think this would happen.

830
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:33,739
Can you please pretend
you didn't know about this?

831
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,940
You're a piece of work.

832
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,579
I'll do as you ask.

833
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,010
But that's it.

834
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,489
Don't ever...

835
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,730
show yourself again.

836
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,739
I won't tell you.

837
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,079
I won't tell you that he helped,

838
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,750
or that he isn't the kind person
you think he is.

839
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,719
"Total."
The pronunciation goes...

840
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,719
If what Ju Yeon said is true,

841
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,289
then why?

842
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,130
Why did he ask me out?

843
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,900
What is he thinking?

844
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,969
"14."

845
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,539
(Kwon Eun Taek)

846
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,650
Mad Hair.

847
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:56,150
Bye.

848
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:59,949
- Is something wrong?
- No.

849
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:01,920
I have to go.

850
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,130
- You're coming with me.
- What for?

851
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,699
What are you doing?

852
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,469
I turn the exam papers
into paper planes...

853
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,909
to give the kids to solve.

854
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,250
Bob, this one is for you. Catch.

855
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:29,449
Good luck on the test. Good job.

856
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:33,559
Is it okay to fold the exam papers?

857
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,289
Of course. They're all kids anyway.

858
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,360
Kids like it this way.

859
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,300
Charles? Did you see that smile?

860
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:44,030
Charles, catch. Do your best.

861
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:49,139
Your planes crash before they fly.

862
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,139
- It flew.
- That's not how to fold a plane.

863
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,380
Look, I'll show you what to do.

864
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,380
Name another student.

865
00:57:56,579 --> 00:57:58,309
There are many others. Jack.

866
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,050
Jack, good luck on the exam.

867
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:09,119
Did you see that?
Now that's a plane.

868
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,429
Jack?

869
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:14,960
See?

870
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,469
You laughed.

871
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,349
I didn't bring an umbrella.

872
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,119
Race with me to the store.
The loser buys an umbrella.

873
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,489
You have the advantage.

874
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:42,920
- In 3... 1.
- I said no.

875
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,730
I said no!

876
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,539
I'm glad I won.

877
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,280
What kind of girl breaks the rules
just to save a few dollars?

878
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,250
What kind of guy complains
all the way home?

879
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:42,820
You pushed me back, didn't you?

880
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:44,019
Forget it.

881
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,460
I can afford to buy an umbrella.

882
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,929
Anyway,

883
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,329
why were you so downcast earlier?

884
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,260
Is something wrong?

885
00:59:57,369 --> 00:59:59,369
- No.
- You liar.

886
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,039
Something is obviously wrong.

887
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:02,900
Right?

888
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,269
The rain stopped.

889
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,539
It did.

890
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:20,860
What you said last time
about your hand...

891
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:24,929
Is it true that Jung hurt you?

892
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:27,630
Why?

893
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:31,130
I guess you got to know him.
Do you believe me now?

894
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:34,840
Is it true or not?

895
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,610
Did he do something?

896
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,510
- No.
- Stop saying no and just tell me.

897
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,309
You will just age faster

898
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,480
Will you stop it?

899
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,579
You always end with a joke.

900
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,349
It wasn't a joke.
You've actually aged.

901
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:54,360
When did you last
look into a mirror?

902
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,920
Jung.

903
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,000
Someone here got burgled.

904
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:12,170
I came by to check
your door and window.

905
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,139
- Thanks.
- What a scene.

906
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,380
Jung looks out for others?

907
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,420
She's my girlfriend.

908
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,449
Is she the reason why you suspended
In Ha's credit cards?

909
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,920
Because I hang around with her?

910
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,820
I want you to be honest.

911
01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:00,349
I won't do anything
that will make you angry.

912
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:02,320
Look who's here.
It's Jung's girlfriend.

913
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,260
You really are different.

914
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,730
Is he here? Where's your boyfriend?

915
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,000
What about me?
We weren't close last year.

916
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:12,070
How do you like me?

917
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:14,239
I like you. I do.

918
01:02:14,269 --> 01:02:18,239
Mad Hair, you'd be shocked to know
what I'm doing for you.

919
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,639
How do you know my brother?

920
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:22,179
Why did you do that to her?

921
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:24,079
You can't afford a girlfriend.

922
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,210
Mad Hair lives there.

923
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:28,449
What on earth am I doing
in the middle of the night?

924
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,920
- Thank you.
- There's no point of warning you.

925
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,460
Whose fault is it?

926
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:35,920
- Is it true?
- It is.

927
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,789
Why? Why should I
stay away from In Ho?

928
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,630
How is everything so simple
and black-and-white with you?

929
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,699
Will you really break up, then?
