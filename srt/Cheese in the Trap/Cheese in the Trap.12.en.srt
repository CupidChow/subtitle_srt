1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,480
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,849
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,449
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,660
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,960
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,300
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,829
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,199
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,109
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,179
Over here.

11
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,390
Here's your coffee.

12
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,689
Do you drink coffee?

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,600
What's the occasion?

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,070
You bought me stale food and coffee.

15
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,899
The cafeteria food is just fine.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,170
Whatever.

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,469
What's the occasion?

18
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,269
You have something to talk.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,540
Do you want to...

20
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,379
enter a piano competition?

21
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:16,709
I think...

22
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,349
it's perfect for you.

23
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,560
He has a much better temperament.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,400
I also think...

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
his colour or style that you mentioned...

26
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,900
is coming out.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,540
That's good to hear.

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,810
I wish...

29
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,709
we could give him a boost.

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,810
Right now he needs...

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,319
an actual, perceptible goal.

32
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,120
How about...

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,120
a piano competition?

34
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,519
That's perfect.

35
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,790
The Grand Music Concours
will be held next month.

36
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,189
One month...

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,359
With In Ho's skill...

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,099
He just has to practise.

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,599
What In Ho needs...

40
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,699
is a small competition, not a large one.

41
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,509
Do you think...

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,210
he'll settle for a small one?

43
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,580
Are you not up for it?

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,189
I do want to tell you that...

45
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,430
you're very old-fashioned.

46
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,490
What?

47
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,460
Is it because
it's a small-scale competition?

48
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,469
A bit.

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you in or not?

50
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll do it.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,009
I can't afford to say no.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,979
Good for you.
I knew you'd say that.

53
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,909
Can I really enter?

54
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,810
Of course.

55
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:56,979
Practise hard.

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,590
A competition...

57
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,900
(Episode 12)

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,069
He's still uploading photos.

59
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,810
This looks like Yonyi University.

60
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,710
- He just won't stop.
- It's fun.

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
- Don't stop.
- Why won't he butt out?

62
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,110
It's only a matter of time
before we figure out who he is.

63
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't care.

64
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,550
If I take a screencap and report it...

65
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,560
If they ask me if I really stalked Seol,

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,189
will they confirm with her?

67
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,199
Is he filming me right now?

68
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,419
That pig.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,919
Watch what you eat.

70
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,389
- Stay out of it.
- What are you doing?

71
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,120
- Okay.
- I need to catch that jerk...

72
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:11,990
before word gets out.

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,790
The number you've dialled...

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,470
He isn't picking up.

75
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,269
I should've told him sooner.

76
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,209
But I couldn't because...

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,540
I couldn't reach him.

78
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,579
We only just made up...

79
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,209
and we're at it again.

80
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,319
His face...

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,420
He was more than just upset.

82
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Come out.

83
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,470
I'll call the police
if you don't come out.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,199
So run away.

85
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,610
Seol.

86
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,810
Stay there.

87
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,579
Just talk.

88
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,189
Seol.

89
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,790
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,490
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

91
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,459
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,600
Sorry for taunting you.

93
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,600
I won't do it again.

94
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,300
Will you forgive me?

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,810
I'll sign something that says...

96
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,209
I won't show myself again.

97
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,910
Will you please tell the jerk
to stop what he's doing?

98
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,910
What?

99
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,819
He uploaded photos of me...

100
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,420
saying I'm a stalker.

101
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,920
That jerk did it, didn't he?

102
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,819
Stop him for me.

103
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,990
Then I won't tell the police.

104
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:53,389
I'll lie low.

105
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:54,689
After everything...

106
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,399
you did last year,

107
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,329
you have the guts to come here?

108
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,800
Have you lost your mind?

109
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,100
No.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,439
I tried to get through to you
and it's not working.

111
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,009
That's why I'm here.

112
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,110
Are you saying it's my fault?

113
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,819
Did you ever take me seriously?

114
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,620
I hate...

115
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,790
having to pretend I like you.

116
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:28,689
You lose your mind
around rich guys like Jung...

117
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,089
Wake up.

118
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,160
You always bring him up.

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
To me...

120
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,800
Jung means more than you ever will.

121
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,100
In every way.

122
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,610
Why is he so special?

123
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,009
He started the whole thing.

124
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,110
He cornered me with his fake innocence...

125
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,220
and everyone bullied me after that.

126
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,720
You know that he's the one who said...

127
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,189
you liked me.

128
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,990
And then he started dating you.

129
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,360
He's the disgusting one here.

130
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,430
He's the liar,

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,529
and he's the psycho schemer
behind everything!

132
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,470
Why does everyone treat me like I'm trash?

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,699
Why?
Why, why, why?

134
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,910
So what?

135
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,379
Did you seek revenge?

136
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,709
You just used me to get...

137
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,420
your own back at Jung.

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,550
You didn't like me.

139
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,519
What do you know?

140
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,189
Unbelievable.

141
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,490
You just don't get it.

142
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,300
Hey.

143
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,600
How about I really scare you?

144
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,569
I can make you cry on your way home.

145
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,569
Do you want to quit university?

146
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,310
How about a fight
outside your parents' restaurant?

147
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,680
If you don't want that,

148
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,709
shut up and tell the jerk
to take down the postings.

149
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,720
Or I'll kill you and him both.

150
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,620
In Ho isn't involved.

151
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,319
What?

152
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:03,720
I posted those photos.

153
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,300
Are you sure about this?

154
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,310
Let's not do this.
I'm scared.

155
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,209
I'll be fine.

156
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,339
It's best if I do it.

157
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,279
I've had enough.

158
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,620
Yeong Gon is a stalker.

159
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,090
Hey, I'm watching you.

160
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,159
Quit while you still can.

161
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
(Posted)

162
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,809
Do you mean that...

163
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,539
you toyed with me?

164
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,580
I warned you, didn't I?

165
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,080
You ignored me.

166
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,480
I see it now.

167
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,220
You blurred out your faces and not mine.

168
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,259
I'll kill you.

169
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,100
Come back!

170
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,799
My eyes!

171
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,000
Come back here!

172
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,259
Mission accomplished.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,110
The loser followed your girlfriend home.

174
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,409
I recorded everything.

175
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,210
You'll want to thank me when you see this.

176
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,210
How about I really scare you?

177
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,450
I can make you cry on your way home.

178
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,480
Do you want to quit university?

179
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,389
How about a fight outside
your parents' restaurant?

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,990
Did you save everything...

181
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,190
you filmed so far?

182
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,830
Send me that phone.

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,470
Eun Taek.

184
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,909
Come back here right now.

185
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,409
Stop.

186
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,909
I said stop.

187
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,909
Dad.
Dad!

188
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,220
Give me that.

189
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,919
- Dad.
- Who are you?

190
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,120
Wrong place.

191
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,519
I'm Seol's friend.

192
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,720
Bye, Seol.
Good evening.

193
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,090
Stop right there.

194
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,889
Stop.

195
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,690
Pray I don't catch you.

196
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,059
- Stop right there!
- Dad.

197
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
Stop!

198
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,330
Come back!

199
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,799
Who is he?

200
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,700
What was he doing?

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,169
Are you all right?

202
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,110
I'm fine.

203
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,509
- Are you?
- Yes.

204
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,279
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

205
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,809
- Are you sure?
- Your shoes...

206
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm fine.

207
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Let's go.

208
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,019
Yeong Gon lost his mind.

209
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,090
He came all the way to my neighbourhood.

210
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,490
He really needs help.

211
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,799
Are you okay?

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I got a recording of that, too.

213
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,070
Once he sees what we have,

214
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,000
he'll have to leave me alone.

215
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
At last.

216
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,610
You're free at last.

217
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,210
I could get into trouble
for posting the photos,

218
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,379
but I don't care at this point.

219
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,110
Anyway,

220
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,720
I have all the proof, so I'll be fine.

221
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,720
He started it all...

222
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,519
by stalking you and...

223
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,820
posting about you.

224
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,590
Yes.
He really made your life horrible.

225
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,789
- You'll be fine.
- He had it coming.

226
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,700
Heart.

227
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,600
I hope so.

228
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,110
Jung...

229
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,610
He won't pick up anyway.

230
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,889
My tummy hurts.

231
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,899
Yeong Gon's on campus.

232
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,799
Here you all are.

233
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,500
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

234
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,809
Perfect timing.

235
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,080
What do you all want for lunch?

236
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,909
It's on me.

237
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,350
How about meat?

238
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,809
- Meat?
- Yes.

239
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
No thanks.

240
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,419
Come on.

241
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,220
Will you join us?

242
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,590
You know how much I love you.

243
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,960
How about pork neck meat?

244
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,899
It's too dry.

245
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,299
Then beef?

246
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,700
Beef brisket?

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
That's too little.

248
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,909
All right, then.
Beef ribs.

249
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,379
- Beef ribs?
- Yes.

250
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,409
My dear junior Yeong Gon.

251
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,220
My dear senior Sang Cheol.

252
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,820
Did you just say my name?

253
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,120
It's all the better.

254
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,490
Pack up, guys.

255
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,690
Lunch is on him.

256
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,090
Do Hyun, you in?

257
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,259
- Why not?
- Come along.

258
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,200
Come on, let's have some meat.

259
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,700
- Meat.
- Meat.

260
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,299
- Follow me.
- Meat.

261
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,000
Meat.

262
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,299
Your love for meat...

263
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,169
I hate Yeong Gon.

264
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,509
I hate Sang Cheol even more.

265
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,610
It's like he's mad for meat.

266
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,009
He must be loaded.

267
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,110
They're all just the same.

268
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,220
They're equally useless.

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,519
They're like kids.

270
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Flocking out after him for free food.

271
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,389
The girls hate him,
so he went for the guys instead.

272
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,690
Why are guys so simple?

273
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,389
Forget about him.

274
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
It's over and he doesn't know it.

275
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,200
I feel bad for the guy.

276
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,500
- Enjoy.
- Eat up.

277
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,899
Eat less meat and more vegetables.
Greens are good for you.

278
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,500
I eat only meat.

279
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,370
Do you, now?

280
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,110
Everyone flocks after money.

281
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeong Gon.

282
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:35,710
Were you really two-timing?

283
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,620
The girl who slapped you.

284
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,419
She was hot.

285
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
I'd date her.

286
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,919
I wanted to ask about that, too.

287
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,090
Too bad I wasn't there to see it.

288
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,889
- Spill.
- Yes.

289
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,690
- Tell us everything.
- Well...

290
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,429
I cheated.

291
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,700
Did you really?

292
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,399
Yeong Gon.

293
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,399
I like you even more.

294
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
- Sorry.
- Not bad.

295
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:02,210
Yeong Gon, the girls hate you,

296
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,710
but the guys envy you.

297
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,110
The girl who came to see you.

298
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,409
She was mad hot.

299
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:07,610
I love girls like her.

300
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,210
She threw herself at me,

301
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,019
so I had some fun with her.

302
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,820
People think I'm a pervert,

303
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,720
but I'm actually a victim.

304
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,720
She cheated on Jung with me.

305
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,889
What?
What about Seol?

306
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,460
He wants to be a man, I guess.

307
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't you guys all know
that I'm the reason...

308
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,600
he started dating Seol?

309
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
When I said I wanted to date her...

310
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,500
- he felt threatened.
- Busy?

311
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,610
There's a weird post
about you on our website.

312
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,009
Check it out.

313
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,409
Yeong Gon, there are photos of you...

314
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,110
on our website.

315
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,350
Did someone post it
to comment on my fabulous looks?

316
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
(It's him.)

317
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,919
That's not me.

318
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,889
There's something on you, Do Hyun.

319
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,289
- What?
- Look.

320
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,789
- Read this.
- Is this how you look?

321
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,799
Hang on.
What's this?

322
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,200
A piece of trash in his fourth year
who only talks about girls?

323
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,000
- That's not...
- Wait.

324
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,899
He goes after young girls.

325
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,210
He tried to approach...

326
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:09,809
a younger girl to...

327
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,509
pick her you-know-what,

328
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,440
and got dumped.

329
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,450
What he needs is an ankle monitor.

330
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,519
When did I ask you to introduce her to me?

331
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,519
You offered to set me up.

332
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,019
I got dumped?

333
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,620
I dumped her, okay?

334
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,389
I know that!

335
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,690
He looks perfectly normal,

336
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:30,990
but he's a weirdo who goes for guys?

337
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
Is that what you think of me?

338
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's drink.

339
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,370
- Sang Cheol, he wrote about you.
- What?

340
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,399
- That's...
- What's there to say?

341
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,799
Exactly.

342
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,610
- Don't read it.
- I like Yeong Gon.

343
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,509
- Don't. You don't see anything.
- Wait.

344
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,110
- This must be it.
- What?

345
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,009
He acts like a boss, but he's dirt poor...

346
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,679
and mooches off on others.

347
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,019
He always borrows laptops and loves meat.

348
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,820
He's almost 190cm tall
and has a huge belly.

349
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,590
He's a beggar with no brain.

350
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:01,190
How did he enter Yonyi?
I pity his parents.

351
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,190
How dare you.

352
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,700
- I didn't write that.
- You scum.

353
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,269
I wasn't going to mention
you were a stalker.

354
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,470
Guys.

355
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,369
He's actually...
Be quiet. Sit still.

356
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,910
He's a stalker.

357
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,309
Photos of him are all over the Internet.

358
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,309
I saw him take photos of girls...

359
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,210
and follow them around.

360
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,109
- He's a psychopath and a jerk.
- You psycho.

361
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,380
Hang on.

362
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,220
He's at Sang Cheol's beck and call...

363
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,519
and wears fake luxury items
and asks if it shows.

364
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,390
He's a dirt-poor jerk.

365
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,190
That's not all.
There's more.

366
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,690
They're like beggars.

367
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,529
When Jung offered to buy lunch,

368
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,029
they flocked to him like starved beggars.

369
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,900
When I offered to treat them,

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
they flocked around me just the same.

371
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,599
Why is my campus full of beggars?

372
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,609
What?
We're beggars?

373
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,480
People like them should be treated
like weeds...

374
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,410
and be gotten rid of.

375
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,109
- What?
- "Gotten rid of"?

376
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,519
Who's the real jerk now?

377
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,289
Explain all that.
What was that about?

378
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,319
- Say something.
- Why are we weeds?

379
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,690
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

380
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,089
Pay the bill!

381
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,359
How'd they find out?

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,369
Seol?
That witch.

383
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,309
She took down her post...

384
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,980
and put it on our website?

385
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,420
I'm coming after you.

386
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,220
I saw what you did to Seol last night.

387
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,390
What now?

388
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,559
How did Cheater Girl see that?

389
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Pick up.

390
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,339
Please pick up.

391
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,009
- You can't...
- Pick up you freak!

392
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,210
That's it.

393
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:02,710
You have a guilty conscience.

394
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,819
Did you make Jung do this?

395
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,819
You two ganged up
to make me look like an idiot.

396
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,089
You, Jung, Seol...

397
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,789
and that loser.

398
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll sue you all.

399
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,299
I won't settle.

400
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,900
They underestimated me.

401
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,609
You'll sue?
Us?

402
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,079
Stalking, attempted assault,

403
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,710
intimidation, defamation and insult.

404
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:39,619
I expect you to be able
to deal with that if you sue us.

405
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:45,019
What's all this?

406
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,789
You can tell it's me.

407
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,029
You can see my face in these!

408
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,559
My face!

409
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Don't send these.

410
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,700
Please don't.

411
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,339
Is this why...

412
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,900
you approached me?

413
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,309
I will kill you all.

414
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,339
Don't ever show yourself.

415
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:09,509
You can't even tell fake from the truth.

416
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,819
Fake?
Fake?

417
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,819
Don't you see that he's fake?

418
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,589
He's fake.

419
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,089
You're the fake one.

420
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,789
You can't tell fake from the truth.

421
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,599
Shut up.

422
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
That's what you said.

423
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,000
- I say it right back.
- Jung...

424
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,200
Jung?

425
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,210
How about I really scare you?

426
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:40,509
I can make you cry on your way home.

427
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,380
Do you want to quit university?

428
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,119
Is this Jung?

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,390
Does that matter?

430
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,890
Watch yourself from now on.

431
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,559
Or that video will end up on our website.

432
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,029
Where are you?

433
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Show yourself.

434
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,569
Talk face-to-face, you scumbag!

435
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,710
This is my final warning.

436
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,579
Pray I never see you again.

437
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,519
He...
Hello?

438
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,220
You jerks!

439
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,589
What are you looking at?

440
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,289
Get lost!

441
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,799
Get lost.
Go away.

442
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,170
Leave me alone!

443
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,799
You jerks.

444
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,589
They got me.

445
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,789
I got duped.

446
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,470
Did you get my phone?

447
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,009
I think we got rid of the stalker.

448
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,309
You can thank me later.

449
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,410
After you give everything back.

450
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,420
Dear handbags,
isn't the weather just lovely?

451
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,349
Come home with me
and I'll show you a good time.

452
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,890
I won't ask you...

453
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,289
for any more favours.

454
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,160
Are you sure about that?

455
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,099
I'll get you some friends
before we go home.

456
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,099
Where should I do that?

457
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,220
The person who...

458
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:09,490
took down my old post and posted it on...

459
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,599
- our college's website...
- Fine. It was me.

460
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,400
Is that a problem?

461
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,700
I don't think so.

462
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,200
Was that really you?

463
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,470
What if you get sued?

464
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,509
Seol said she'd take care of it.

465
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,480
I did it because she almost got into
huge trouble yesterday.

466
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:28,509
I wanted to end it for good.

467
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:31,210
Doesn't anything scare you?

468
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,119
You got in a fight
with Yeong Gon last year,

469
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,349
and again this year.

470
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,420
What will you do, Seol?

471
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,890
Shouldn't you tell Jung?

472
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:41,390
Well...

473
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,589
I can't say we fought again.

474
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,599
I don't think...

475
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,569
he should know what happened.

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,809
So...I...Well...

477
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:57,109
You know...

478
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,380
- What?
- It's...

479
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,410
Actually...
It's like...

480
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,420
- All this...
- What?

481
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,420
Ju...

482
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,089
Jung helped me.

483
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,690
- What?
- What? What happened?

484
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,099
Ever since our mid-terms,
Jung told me to tell him...

485
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,900
what Yeong Gon did and I did.

486
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,900
I sent all the photos and videos,

487
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,099
and he told me to post them
on our website.

488
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,910
He knew all about it?

489
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,509
So you want me to post what he wrote...

490
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:38,619
- on our college's website?
- Yes.

491
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,980
So everyone can read it.

492
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,490
He cares what others think,

493
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:44,720
so it'll work.

494
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,589
I see what you mean.

495
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,490
Delete what he said about Seol.

496
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,599
Post the bad stuff
he said about the others.

497
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,569
Why didn't you tell us?

498
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,069
Because...

499
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:00,599
I thought Jung was waiting for Seol
to tell him herself.

500
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,710
That's why.

501
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:05,009
Jung's really odd, too.

502
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,609
His girlfriend is being stalked
and he just...

503
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,710
Is that what you'd do?

504
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,980
Of course not.
I'd go and smash the guy's head...

505
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,220
If anyone ever bothered you,

506
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,819
I'd chase him down and chew him up.

507
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,289
And turn his gold crown
into a ring for you.

508
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,589
No thanks.

509
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,490
You're weird, too.

510
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,099
Why didn't you tell him...

511
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,369
until things got this bad?

512
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,599
I'd have told him everything
and more out of frustration.

513
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,710
I have to go.
Sorry.

514
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,069
Where are you going?

515
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,619
The two of them are kind of similar.

516
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,289
They aren't exactly normal.

517
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,490
And so it's just us together again.

518
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:53,890
What?

519
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,190
All you need is a gold ring.

520
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,529
He'll get at you.

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,470
Think about it.

522
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,500
Why do you think he sent me after you?

523
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,509
Jung threatened me and made me...

524
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,009
throw away his paper.

525
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,440
To give you the scholarship.

526
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:13,809
The accident...

527
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,309
was Jung's fault.

528
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,450
Watch out.

529
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
There's more to him than you see.

530
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:22,289
Jung, tell her for me.

531
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,819
You picked out the topic,

532
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,289
and you told me what to write
in the slides.

533
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,990
I understand him.

534
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,190
There's understanding and affection...

535
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,700
behind the give and take
and it goes both ways.

536
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,599
If you don't think you can deal with him,

537
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,200
leave him alone.

538
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't give him a hard time.

539
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,819
- In Ha.
- Just a moment.

540
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,519
You just got out, didn't you?

541
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:57,619
Get out.

542
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,990
Thank you.

543
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,490
What's all that?

544
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,599
Hello, In Ho.

545
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,099
Are you going to work?

546
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,099
Where'd you get the money?

547
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:11,569
For all this?

548
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,200
From Jung.

549
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,809
- Jung?
- Yes.

550
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,210
He cancelled your credit cards
then bought you this?

551
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,609
- Yes.
- I know you're bad at lying.

552
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,809
Don't!

553
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,019
I need to move out of this dump.

554
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,420
I may live with you,

555
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,420
but stay out of my business.

556
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,490
Tell the truth before I throw this away.

557
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,890
Give that back!

558
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,089
- Follow me.
- You...

559
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,190
Give them back.

560
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,549
Can I come in?

561
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,789
Sit down.

562
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,269
Why did he give you all this?

563
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,299
You wouldn't know if I told you.

564
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,000
I would, so tell me.

565
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:22,109
I cut a deal with Jung.

566
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,609
What kind of deal?

567
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,710
That Hong Shim or Hong Sam girl.

568
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,819
He used a freak to get rid of her
and now he wants the freak gone.

569
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,019
- A freak?
- You wouldn't know.

570
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,720
There's this weird freak.

571
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:37,119
What freak?

572
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,490
- The stalker?
- You know so well.

573
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,690
You know everything about her.
Yes, him.

574
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,559
So...

575
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,500
for getting rid of him...

576
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:50,299
- did he give you all this?
- Yes.

577
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,799
What was I to do?
Jung said he needed me.

578
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,609
You have no idea how busy I am.

579
00:28:57,809 --> 00:28:59,609
Jung calls me when he needs something.

580
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,609
He relies on me.

581
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:05,619
I helped him out, he let me use
my credit cards and I went shopping.

582
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,119
Leave me alone.

583
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:08,619
So...

584
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:13,190
Jung got that freak involved with you...

585
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,089
and then he asked you to get rid of him?

586
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,390
Then...

587
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,799
he had some fun.

588
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,200
He played around.

589
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,799
Go and ask him.

590
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,569
It was all a game.

591
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,440
That scumbag.

592
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,910
Yesterday.

593
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:35,910
Why did you...

594
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,319
just leave?

595
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,619
Did you ignore my calls
because you thought...

596
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,789
I'd gotten close with In Ho?

597
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,789
No.

598
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,900
I was too busy to call.

599
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,299
Really?

600
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:11,710
In Ho and I...

601
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,319
We actually got quite close.

602
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,289
He helped me out a lot,

603
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,190
so I wanted to help him in return.

604
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,599
I wanted to help him...

605
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,900
play the piano again...

606
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,900
and get his GED.

607
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,710
That's all there is.

608
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,539
And...

609
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:40,009
the incident with Yeong Gon...

610
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,710
Eun Taek told you everything,

611
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,720
so I think you know that he came to
my neighbourhood yesterday.

612
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
Yes.

613
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:57,289
I pretended not to know
because I thought you didn't want to tell.

614
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
About that.

615
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,430
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

616
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,809
It's too hard
to tell you things like that.

617
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:11,609
It's over now.

618
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,309
- Let's not talk about...
- No.

619
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,450
It's not over.

620
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,519
I tried...

621
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,390
really hard...

622
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,000
to say all that.

623
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,599
Now I want to hear your answer.

624
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,069
What?

625
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:45,279
Your honest answer.

626
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:50,680
Do you think I'm hiding something?

627
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,720
What you always say.

628
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,690
I didn't think Yeong Gon
would go that far.

629
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,089
That's not what I intended.

630
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,900
What I want to hear from you...

631
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,400
isn't that kind of answer.

632
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,809
What, then?

633
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:19,579
What do you want me to say?

634
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,720
Let's not talk about Yeong Gon.

635
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,289
This isn't about Yeong Gon.

636
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,789
It's about us.

637
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,900
Stop evading it.

638
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,599
I disliked you so much,
so I sent that text to Yeong Gon.

639
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,099
I wasn't too busy to call you.

640
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,579
I didn't call because I was upset
about you and In Ho.

641
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:57,309
That's what I want to hear.

642
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,589
Why...

643
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,819
would you want to hear that?

644
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,490
I always...

645
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,799
asked you to be honest,

646
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,900
and got frustrated and annoyed
when you weren't.

647
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,210
I thought it was all your fault,
but now I see it wasn't.

648
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,410
I never told you what I was thinking,

649
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,279
yet I demanded just that from you.

650
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,319
I won't do that.

651
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,220
I want you to be honest with me, too.

652
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,690
Don't hide anything.

653
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,900
I want to see who you really are.

654
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:52,339
I don't know what you're saying.

655
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,269
Let's go.
I'll take you home.

656
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,860
What's wrong with you?

657
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:18,760
You're working for him
for things like this?

658
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:19,960
Where's your pride?

659
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,460
- Are you his puppet?
- Hey!

660
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
- Are you crazy?
- What a loser.

661
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:25,969
Pride?

662
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,269
That doesn't feed or clothe you.

663
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,380
What right do you have to worry about me?

664
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,280
To me...

665
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,750
you are worse of a jerk
than Jung is, okay?

666
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,579
These are too expensive to kick.

667
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,230
Hey.

668
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,269
- Ta-da.
- What's that?

669
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,469
Look.

670
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,739
Daniel Redkovich?

671
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,380
- The pianist you raved about?
- Yes.

672
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,949
I never thought I'd get to see him play,

673
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,079
but he's coming to Korea.

674
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,880
Wait and see.

675
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,789
I'll find a copy of the score
he arranged...

676
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,360
and get him to sign it
and make it an heirloom.

677
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,460
- Don't you have a competition?
- Yes, but I'll skip it.

678
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,360
They happen to overlap.

679
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,360
My dad's coming to see you.

680
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,099
Forget it.
He might never come to Korea again.

681
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,869
Whatever.

682
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,469
If you really want to go,
tell him yourself.

683
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,480
You're so cold.

684
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,250
Your name means "affection",
but you have none at all.

685
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,389
Was that lame?

686
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:50,949
Let's go to the piano room.

687
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,059
What for?

688
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,860
I'm bored.
Come and watch me play.

689
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,559
- I don't want to...
- Just listen.

690
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,099
Who's in here?

691
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,469
Oh, hi, Jung.

692
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,730
Yong Soo.

693
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,139
Are you entering the competition?

694
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,670
Yes.
You knew?

695
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,570
Jung's father supports you, too?

696
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,980
Practise harder.
You never won an award so far.

697
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,380
What's that?

698
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,679
Are you preparing for a college exam?

699
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,989
No wonder you never win a prize.

700
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,690
Your music lacks a soul.

701
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,559
Get lost.
You're done here.

702
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,929
Learn to feel the music.

703
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,360
Go.

704
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,969
Watch what you say.

705
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,269
What for?

706
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,239
I said that for his own good.

707
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,070
I'm not entering this competition.

708
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,369
In Ho.

709
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,780
What?

710
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,880
I come first all the time.

711
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,110
I deserve a break.

712
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:53,219
Then I'll come first again.

713
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,300
Why isn't Jung here with you?

714
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,869
He had to go somewhere else.

715
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,269
He'll be here before the competition ends.

716
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,570
He should watch In Ho play.

717
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:51,239
Is everything okay at school?

718
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:54,309
I'd have told you already
if something were wrong.

719
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,079
Mr. Yu, where will we go for dinner?

720
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,119
I really liked the restaurant
we went to last time.

721
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,289
- Did you? Let's eat there, then.
- Okay.

722
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,260
- I have something to say, too.
- Do you?

723
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,760
Yes.

724
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,829
Adoption?

725
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,840
You look shocked.

726
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,139
You've lived with us for a long time now,

727
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,480
and we're practically a family.

728
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,780
I would like you two...

729
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,889
to become Jung's actual siblings.

730
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,050
So before it's too late,

731
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:41,860
I'd like to list you
both on my family register.

732
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,030
What do you say?

733
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,869
You don't have to answer now.

734
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,030
Take some time to think.

735
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,670
Okay?

736
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,380
- I don't want to be adopted.
- Be quiet.

737
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,480
Why not?
We can become a family.

738
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,489
Stop talking nonsense.

739
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,360
I want to marry Jung,
not become his sister.

740
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,960
- Think before you talk.
- You're still at it?

741
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:18,559
Do you think he'd marry you?

742
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,030
- As if.
- Watch it.

743
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,469
Stop being silly.

744
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,730
Do as Mr. Yu says.

745
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,369
I bet Jung's against it.

746
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,210
What?

747
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,980
He looked shocked,

748
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,309
but then so were we.

749
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,110
That wasn't his displeased face.

750
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,280
Do you think he meant that?

751
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,179
Don't you know him at all?

752
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,389
I know him better than you do.

753
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:45,119
I know him better.

754
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,460
- Is this really for me?
- Yes.

755
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,699
This is almost impossible to get.

756
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,469
What's that?

757
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,739
What's this?

758
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,579
Daniel Redkovich's autograph?

759
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,380
It's mine.
Give it back.

760
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,849
Where'd you get this?

761
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,980
- See you, Jung.
- Bye.

762
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,150
Hey.
Hey.

763
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,250
I gave it to him.

764
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,190
What?

765
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,230
I went to the concert.

766
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:31,329
But...

767
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,210
Instead of coming to my piano competition,
you went to...

768
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:42,210
Why did you give that to him?

769
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,880
I thought he'd like it.

770
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Hey.

771
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,050
Are you angry with me?

772
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:53,960
- No.
- I'm not stupid.

773
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,760
I can tell.

774
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,460
Is it...

775
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
about that?

776
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,369
- What your father said.
- Your adoption?

777
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,570
That was his decision.

778
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,739
I'm asking you.
What do you think?

779
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:16,280
If you're against it, say so.
Be a man.

780
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,250
I don't care.

781
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,150
You don't care?

782
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:29,929
It's not like or dislike but don't care?

783
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,860
No, I don't care.

784
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,880
Jung, what do you do on weekends?

785
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,179
I'm usually at home.

786
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,050
- What about you?
- I usually study...

787
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,380
or go hiking or fishing.

788
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,250
- Have you ever gone fishing?
- Never.

789
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,389
- Never?
- Never.

790
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:01,059
I went fishing last weekend
and caught a fish...

791
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,260
that was 30cm long.

792
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,559
- Right on the spot...
- The food's disgusting today.

793
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:10,030
Did you lose your appetite, too?
Eat the tangerine instead.

794
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,769
Jung, my dear friend.

795
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:52,170
I called a few lovely,
curvy girls for you.

796
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,110
Do you know the bar "Remember"?

797
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,179
8pm.
"Remember".

798
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,579
See you there.
Bye.

799
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,289
- Come by if you can.
- I speak good English.

800
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:04,590
Remember.

801
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:06,159
Not bad, right?

802
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,559
- Yong Soo.
- Jung.

803
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,230
Are you going somewhere with them?

804
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,360
- Where?
- I heard them say "Remember".

805
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,329
Aren't they a dodgy crowd?

806
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,739
Them? They're pretty decent
if you get to know them.

807
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:24,670
- Do you want to join us?
- Me?

808
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,679
With you?

809
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:29,280
Okay.
I'll be there.

810
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:30,349
Hey.

811
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,780
Practise some more
if you have time to waste.

812
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,380
In Ho.

813
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,590
- Do you want to get in on it too?
- No.

814
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,590
I know what they're up to.

815
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,159
Do you...

816
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:48,929
Anyway.

817
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,769
Watch yourself.

818
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,139
Don't do anything stupid.

819
00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:54,969
Your father might find out.

820
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,039
He wouldn't...

821
00:43:58,570 --> 00:43:59,980
unless someone tells him.

822
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,349
Right?

823
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,179
What do you mean?

824
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,219
Are you entering another competition?

825
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,889
Play the piano instead of
wasting your time.

826
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,260
You spend Mr. Yu's money,
but you never pass the preliminaries.

827
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,860
I saw that look.

828
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,559
Drink up.

829
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,670
Is this child's play?

830
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,739
- Got any whisky?
- No.

831
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,340
Look at the bottle instead.
That might help.

832
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,679
Why are you here?

833
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,380
- Jung said he'd be here.
- Jung?

834
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,480
Did he say he'd be here?

835
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,449
- No.
- Here you all are.

836
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,050
- Who are you?
- Stay seated.

837
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:48,360
Good for you.
I'm so proud of you.

838
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,960
You took the girls out for drinks?

839
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,860
Then you got caught
and ruined our reputation?

840
00:44:56,469 --> 00:44:57,570
Yong Soo.

841
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:00,139
What were you doing there?

842
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:02,769
Can I really not enter the competition?

843
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:04,570
Don't you get it?

844
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,309
You were caught on the scene.

845
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,579
Why did you hang out with them
before an important competition?

846
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,980
Push-up positions.

847
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,980
Do it!

848
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,159
Who told on us?

849
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,159
Only we know about that bar.

850
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,159
Play the piano instead of
wasting your time.

851
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:29,570
You spend Mr. Yu's money,
but you never pass the preliminaries.

852
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,030
I know who did that.

853
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,369
What?

854
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,940
I know who called the police.

855
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,150
- Let go.
- You're coming with us.

856
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,130
Stand up, you jerk.

857
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,460
- You're dead.
- Don't touch me.

858
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:06,769
It wasn't me, you jerks!

859
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,480
Don't!

860
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,559
Stop it, will you?

861
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,829
It's all your fault!

862
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,250
I'm sorry.

863
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,219
I wanted you...

864
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:32,389
to be Jung's siblings.

865
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,860
Did you hate the idea so much?

866
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,559
In Ho.

867
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,369
It wasn't, was it?

868
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,579
Was it you?

869
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,150
What should I say...

870
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,480
that would make you happy?

871
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,590
Was it you?

872
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,059
Was it really you?

873
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,460
No.

874
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,230
It was all you.

875
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,329
Think about it.

876
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,469
You scumbag.

877
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,739
Why did you do it?

878
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,980
Why did you do this to me?

879
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:32,780
Why do people want what isn't theirs?

880
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,690
Once they start thinking
it's theirs when it isn't,

881
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,159
they lose what is really theirs.

882
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,960
Are you saying
you did this to me because...

883
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,099
you don't want us to be family?

884
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,170
Because of something like that?

885
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,179
Think what you will.

886
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:36,349
In Ho.

887
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:40,880
Where are you going?

888
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,489
Where are you going?

889
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,320
I don't know.
Don't wait up.

890
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,329
Fine.
Go.

891
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:56,469
This is what you're like.

892
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:58,469
I'd forgotten.

893
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,369
You're more than capable of leaving me.

894
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,110
Go.

895
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,980
Never come back.

896
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,880
I'll enjoy myself here.

897
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,380
If you do come back,

898
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,389
I'll kill you myself.

899
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,139
Thanks for the lift.

900
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
Seol.

901
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,579
Good night.

902
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:35,860
Where are you?
Let's talk.

903
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,349
What did you do to In Ha?

904
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,789
She told you already?

905
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,960
Taking more than she deserves
then acting the victim?

906
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,260
I've had enough of it.

907
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,159
You just won't stop.

908
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,199
When will you leave Seol alone?

909
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:12,230
I think you're trying to annoy me.

910
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,869
Don't you feel stupid?

911
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,670
Figure out your own life.

912
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,210
Can I...

913
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,980
ask you for a favour?

914
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:28,679
Can I hit you?

915
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,849
I really want to beat you up.

916
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,320
One-on-one, just once.

917
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,159
What do you say?

918
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,460
Fine.

919
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,579
Let's see who dies first.

920
00:52:57,349 --> 00:52:59,210
It's a perfect day for that.

921
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,579
Let's both die!

922
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,170
I've had enough.

923
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,570
You must be kidding me.

924
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,380
Get up.

925
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,559
Wow...

926
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,059
You have a pretty mean punch.
How did you hold it in?

927
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,940
You should've done this long ago,
you two-faced scum.

928
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:55,769
Then...

929
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,670
we wouldn't have drifted so far apart.

930
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,280
Are you blaming me again?

931
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,280
You pity yourself so much
that you blame everyone else.

932
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,480
What about you?

933
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,219
You become a prickly porcupine
whenever someone gets near you.

934
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,960
You got the stalker interested,

935
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,159
and then you used In Ha to get rid of him.

936
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,130
Is that your idea of protecting Mad Hair?

937
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,199
Shut your mouth.

938
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,969
I'll deal with it.

939
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,739
I thought...

940
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,579
you actually had feelings for her.

941
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,590
Do you even know
what it means to like someone?

942
00:54:44,389 --> 00:54:46,389
Why do you care?

943
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,360
I like her.

944
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,739
I care because I like her, okay?

945
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,579
Yes.

946
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,849
This is what you're best at.

947
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:16,150
You pretend to be a friend,
then stab me in the back.

948
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,329
Who stabbed who in the back first?

949
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
Right.

950
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:31,570
This isn't my back.

951
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,679
Leave Seol alone.

952
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,380
Says who?

953
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:53,320
That hurt.

954
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,360
What can you do for her?

955
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,860
You can barely sort yourself out.

956
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:05,369
You tell me.

957
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,070
Can you guarantee...

958
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,769
you won't do the same thing
you did to me to her?

959
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,679
Can you say that?

960
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:20,119
Jerks like you...

961
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,750
don't take long to figure out.

962
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,489
Even I know.

963
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,219
Do you think she doesn't?

964
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,860
You can't hide who you are!

965
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,559
In the end...

966
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,570
you destroy everyone around you.

967
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,369
I'm not the one who should clear off.

968
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:47,380
You're the one
who needs to leave her alone.

969
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,940
How dare you.

970
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,889
You jerk.

971
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:59,690
When will you stop being like this?

972
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,159
You're the one
who needs to leave her alone.

973
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,260
Mad Hair...

974
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,030
You piece of trash!

975
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,960
You're...

976
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:08,929
You're the...

977
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,730
That hurts!

978
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:12,769
Stop it!

979
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,880
Seol.

980
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,380
I'm outside.

981
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,380
Can you come out?

982
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:30,690
What's going on?

983
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,260
Jung.

984
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,469
Jung.

985
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:49,170
What happened to your face?
Who did this to you?

986
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:05,289
Be still.

987
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,760
Does it hurt?

988
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,969
Let me see.

989
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,199
What a mess.

990
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:24,070
Don't you have work tomorrow?

991
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,780
Was it In Ho?

992
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,210
He started the fight.

993
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:37,690
So what?
Did you say, "Sure, why not?"

994
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,360
Yes.

995
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,769
It used to be verbal,
but now it got physical.

996
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,880
Why?

997
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,480
What's this about?

998
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,219
In Ho's upset about his hand.

999
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,789
What do you have to be upset about?

1000
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,760
Sorry.

1001
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,460
You're still fighting over
what happened in high school.

1002
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,559
I really don't get it.

1003
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:27,369
You aren't the kind of person
who goes around punching people.

1004
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,369
Why do you hate In Ho so much?

1005
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,269
I have one more.

1006
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,769
I like this more than the original one.

1007
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,309
Is this my score?

1008
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:13,079
Wow, this is the arranged one.

1009
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,679
You're a real fan.
What's your name?

1010
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,590
Baek In Ho.

1011
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,300
Thanks for
attending my concert tonight, In Ho.

1012
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,230
Thanks.
Thanks for playing tonight.

1013
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,880
Are you after him?

1014
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,579
- Yes.
- Did you hear me play?

1015
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:44,110
Wasn't I amazing?

1016
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,980
The crowd was amazed
by the time I was done.

1017
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,780
- I saw the Chairman.
- Mr. Yu?

1018
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,119
He's here to see me.

1019
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,460
I told him not to come,
but he didn't listen.

1020
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:59,760
How did you become friends with Jung?

1021
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,659
Why?
Do you want to be his friend?

1022
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:05,269
Because of Mr. Yu?

1023
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:08,269
Forget about it.

1024
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:11,570
He's all smiles,
but he hates people like you.

1025
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,170
Jung's rich,

1026
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,780
popular and does well in school.

1027
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,250
- Everyone envies him.
- What for?

1028
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,150
You don't know him well enough.

1029
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:24,690
He's pathetic.

1030
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,389
So what if he's rich?

1031
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:30,960
He doesn't have a dream,
and he's not allowed to do anything.

1032
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,329
That's why he likes me.

1033
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:35,730
I bet I'm the only one...

1034
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,969
who understands him.

1035
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,769
He's a poor kid.

1036
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,769
Don't let your nerves
get the better of you.

1037
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:44,969
Good luck.

1038
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,559
Adoption?

1039
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,730
We're practically a family.

1040
01:02:12,369 --> 01:02:13,940
I would like you two...

1041
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:17,210
to become Jung's actual siblings.

1042
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:19,210
So before it's too late,

1043
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:23,039
I'd like to list you both
on my family register.

1044
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:25,380
What do you say?

1045
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,760
I'd been thinking
about adopting them for a while.

1046
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,460
I owe Doctor Baek so much.

1047
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,360
I want to look after his grandchildren.

1048
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,369
Why should you object to that?

1049
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:51,110
You left our son behind.
You have no right.

1050
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,780
Jung won't object.
He has no reason to.

1051
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,449
What?
Spying?

1052
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:02,179
How is that spying?

1053
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,489
You know what Jung is like.

1054
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,690
I'm not being negative.

1055
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,860
If I just let him be,
he'll turn into a sociopath.

1056
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,730
That's what Doctor Baek said.

1057
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,260
He can't manage
unless someone is always watching him.

1058
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:18,570
That's why he needs siblings.

1059
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:23,139
I made the decision
because it's what is best for him.

1060
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,769
I will sort everything out.

1061
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,750
You don't have a say.

1062
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,579
That's when it started.

1063
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,050
I wasn't against the adoption.

1064
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:41,360
I was shocked,

1065
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,460
but that was acceptable.

1066
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:46,760
The fact that those...

1067
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,199
whom I thought were friends...

1068
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:54,300
had been spying on me...

1069
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:57,570
That was too much for me.

1070
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,579
My father always knew everything.

1071
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,750
It was as if...

1072
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,480
he was always watching.

1073
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,590
With a hand on my shoulder...

1074
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,190
he'd say, "Be calm."

1075
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,659
Don't be greedy.

1076
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:19,360
Always give in.

1077
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,869
As if I had done something wrong.

1078
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,039
Am I that strange?

1079
01:04:40,449 --> 01:04:41,579
Am I...

1080
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,789
really that weird?

1081
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,030
Jung.

1082
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,570
We didn't get along at all at first.

1083
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:05,210
We both thought the other was weird.

1084
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,480
But now I think...

1085
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,880
we weren't weird.

1086
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,219
We're just different.

1087
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:18,949
You're like this.

1088
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,360
I'm like that.

1089
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,460
We are just different.

1090
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:34,469
People used to say
I was too sensitive and frustrating.

1091
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,940
I got that a lot.

1092
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,579
That used to stress me out.

1093
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,780
My conclusion is that...

1094
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,849
I'm that kind of person.

1095
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,389
I'm not sure,

1096
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,460
but I think...

1097
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,360
you just didn't have the chance...

1098
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,360
to be honest.

1099
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:09,969
That must have made you feel so lonely.

1100
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,980
Now you don't have to suffer alone.

1101
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:22,250
You have my back.

1102
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,119
I really do...

1103
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,460
want to get to know you.

1104
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:41,570
I was afraid.

1105
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:48,110
That if you saw the real me,

1106
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:51,980
you'd leave me.

1107
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,130
I...

1108
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:18,369
like you very much.

1109
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,880
Much more than before.

1110
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,570
You were always different.

1111
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,869
You watched me...

1112
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:51,039
and showed your displeasure.

1113
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,780
You affected me so much.

1114
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,579
In even the smallest of ways.

1115
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,380
I think...

1116
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:07,789
I was afraid of you.

1117
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,960
That you'd get to me.

1118
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:18,170
I don't like that.

1119
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,970
But not any more.

1120
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,380
Now...

1121
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,579
I'm afraid of you leaving me.

1122
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,560
I like you very much.

1123
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,470
I like you.

1124
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,310
Very much.

1125
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,770
It hurts.

1126
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,310
I feel so cold.

1127
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:06,569
It's freezing.

1128
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:31,869
Did you put on any ointment?

1129
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,770
Shouldn't you yell at me
for beating up your boyfriend?

1130
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,970
That's not much of a threat.
She knows everything.

1131
01:10:37,069 --> 01:10:38,140
How much does she know?

1132
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,310
She'll never ever understand you.

1133
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,779
Seol, you have the sample tests?

1134
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,680
That's all you need.

1135
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:47,149
It practically fell in your lap.

1136
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,149
Does she know you like her?

1137
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,489
She puts up with you
because you're friends,

1138
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:54,189
but it's over the second she finds out.

1139
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:57,060
I won't spend time with him
unless it's to study.

1140
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:59,060
10,000 dollars.
You have a week.

1141
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,659
Don't get any ideas.

1142
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:03,060
I can take everything down
that's dear to you.

1143
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,369
I guess you've fallen in love.

1144
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,229
Forget about my GED.

1145
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,270
Is something wrong?

1146
01:11:08,369 --> 01:11:09,569
What do you care for?

1147
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,369
Wake up.
Where's the doctor?

1148
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,369
Wake up.
Mad Hair.

1149
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,180
Sorry.

1150
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:18,050
I won't let this happen again.

1151
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:19,380
I'll always be with you.
