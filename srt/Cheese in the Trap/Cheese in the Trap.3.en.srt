1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,440
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,750
You should've been careful.

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,480
Shall we eat together?

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,760
Get a grip, Hong Seol.
Don't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,690
- Mad Hair.
- Are you insane?

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:23,859
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,329
- It's a great idea.
- Isn't it?

8
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:28,829
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,880
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,820
Seol. Seol. Seol.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320
A strange guy in college
started to act strangely.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,520
Why? Are you bothered?

13
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,090
Behind that smile hides
a frightening two-faced man.

14
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:54,289
Let's take a photo.

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,689
Get a grip, Hong Seol.
Don't let that smile fool you.

16
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,799
- It's good to see you again.
- What?

17
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,869
Mad Hair. Mad Hair.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,500
- Me?
- Mad Hair.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,909
My biggest cause of stress
is you leeching off me.

20
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,010
How do you know her?

21
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,810
Stay away from my people.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,609
Can you set me up with Yu Jung?

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,750
I thought we'd gotten quite close.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,349
You approached for a reason, too.

25
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,450
You're just like everyone else.

26
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,159
Yu Jung...

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,200
He looked really angry.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
Because I set him up with Ah Young
without his permission?

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,370
Why would that be that upsetting?

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,409
I don't get it.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,810
Why is it so confusing?

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,319
(Episode 3)

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,590
- Acting class...
- Pick one first.

34
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,989
Maybe Jung...

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,489
Jung, come and sit here.

36
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,090
- Ask him.
- Hello.

37
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,000
- It's important.
- It is.

38
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,200
It's just like last year.

39
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,469
He turns his back on me so coldly.

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,800
- Us two.
- Just us.

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,009
- No way.
- I'll make it work.

42
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,610
- Why you?
- Stop it.

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,710
- You aren't popular at all.
- Count me in.

44
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,409
Jung. I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

45
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,680
- I'd like it, but...
- Okay. Sure.

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
- Help me out.
- I can't.

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,090
- Come on.
- Why not?

48
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,419
So... About Ah Young...

49
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,560
- I didn't mean to...
- We're talking.

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,960
- I can't help.
- Hello.

51
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

52
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,169
You all look so lively today.

53
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,909
I have some good news that
will calm you down.

54
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,310
I uploaded the list of teams
and a discussion topic...

55
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,650
that each team will present on
for the final.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,689
Who moaned?

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,389
I know you're all calling me
a witch under your breath.

58
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,199
I'm happiest when I give you
something to do.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,400
When each team
gives their presentation,

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,199
I will focus mainly on how well
the team members cooperated.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,099
Here's an advance warning.

62
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:24,539
If you plan on being a free rider
so the others have to do the work,

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,509
don't let me catch you.

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,150
If you do, I'll fail the whole team.
That's what I call "an all-kill".

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,319
Hong Seol, did you get that?

66
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,949
- Yes.
- Good.

67
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,189
Check who to team up with
and gather in teams.

68
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,060
Gosh. I never thought
we'd be in the same team.

69
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm retaking this course.
Don't fail me.

70
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,169
Me, too. I hope it all works out.

71
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,810
I'm so glad we're in the same team.

72
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,409
Okay. I think it's unanimous.

73
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,509
Hong Seol is our team leader.

74
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,750
This semester is going to be
really tough.

75
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,020
Hong Seol. Hong Seol.
Join in, girls.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,319
You, over there.
Are you on a picnic?

77
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:11,990
- Sorry.
- Call me later.

78
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,590
Hong Seol, go!

79
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,000
Isn't this great?

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,230
PT Hong, Hong PT.

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,199
- I'm so relieved.
- Jung.

82
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
- Send her a text message.
- No way.

83
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,769
I have work to do.

84
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,009
Why me?

85
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,209
I definitely said I was sorry.

86
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,410
And he accepted it
and said "okay, sure".

87
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,779
Then, it's settled.

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,079
He's angry.
He's really angry.

89
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,250
- Why on earth...
- You approached for a reason, too.

90
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,230
- "Too"?
- You're just like everyone else.

91
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:53,560
Did he expect
something different from me?

92
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,769
Why from me? What did he want?

93
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,779
I don't get it.

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
Seol.

95
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,050
Shall we have lunch together?

96
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,120
I have lunch plans.

97
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,290
- Okay...
- Seol.

98
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,720
Ah Young.

99
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,860
Maybe some other time, Min Soo.

100
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,500
I couldn't reach you
because you'd lost your phone.

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,800
No wonder.

102
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,699
Did you get home safely?

103
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,199
- Well...
- What happened?

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,069
Did Jung say something?

105
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,410
Not really.

106
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,350
Are you good friends with Seol?

107
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,949
After you left...

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,089
he just sat there in silence.

109
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,259
I'd never felt that way before.

110
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,889
He was so cold and scary.

111
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,329
He made me feel like
I was an object.

112
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,100
He asked me one thing before
he left. He asked where you live.

113
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,870
I gave him your address.
Did he not come by?

114
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,480
Did I make things awkward
for you two?

115
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,709
What? No.

116
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,220
- Not at all.
- But...

117
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,350
I did get an impression.

118
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,790
I think he likes you.

119
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,759
What? That's impossible.

120
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,959
That's just nonsense.

121
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,300
I think I'm right.

122
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,769
He suddenly became distant
when I mentioned you'd set us up.

123
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,839
He's jealous and angry
over what you did. I'm sure of it.

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,079
Weird.

125
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,449
Why is she in a daze?

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,519
He likes me?

127
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,589
Me?

128
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,629
Jung likes me?
Why would he? That's nonsense.

129
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,259
Let's not go too far.

130
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,930
Is it serious?

131
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,000
Is it worse? What's going on?

132
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,769
Earlier on, she was in a daze.

133
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,480
- Now it seems she's in shock.
- Really?

134
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,180
Why don't you come clean
before things get worse?

135
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,019
She rarely gets angry,
but when she does it's really bad.

136
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,019
She's been ignoring my calls
and texts since yesterday.

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,389
- Why did you introduce him to her?
- Say that one more time.

138
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,759
Will this lunch coupon work?

139
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,930
Let me see that.
Let's give it a go.

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,870
Hong.

141
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,910
Hello. Hong, Hong.

142
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,209
- How are you?
- No way.

143
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,819
I love you. You're all I have.

144
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,120
- I don't think so.
- You know so. You must.

145
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,790
I'm meeting him later today.

146
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,490
Tell me if you want him beaten up.

147
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,959
- I'll do this to him. And this...
- Stop.

148
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,189
Why'd you slap me?

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,199
I'm off to find my phone.

150
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,800
What? Did you lose your phone?

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,000
You weren't ignoring me after all?

152
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,269
I was not. Silly.

153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,839
Where did you leave your phone?
I was so worried.

154
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,209
- Try calling.
- Maybe it's out of batteries.

155
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,480
Hello?

156
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,350
- Hello? Hello?
- Who's this?

157
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,990
Wow. Her eyes really
do look like that.

158
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,590
Hey.

159
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,529
Hello.

160
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,730
- Two more servings of meat, please.
- Okay.

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,399
Sit.

162
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,980
Eat up.

163
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,509
You can eat.

164
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,509
I'll take my phone and...

165
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,419
Hey. Eat first.

166
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,419
You can have it then.

167
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,330
Are you dating Yu Jung?

168
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,759
What?

169
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,570
Do you know him?

170
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,000
Him?

171
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,470
Yes. You aren't exactly his type.

172
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,309
Your hair looks like a mad dog's.

173
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,309
What are those? Pigtails?

174
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,909
One, two, three, four, five.

175
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Hey. You're a bit too rude.

176
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,950
Sorry.

177
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,690
Hang on. What's going on, then?

178
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,289
Is he following you around?
While you see other guys?

179
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,200
He's not that kind of a guy.

180
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,899
How exactly do you know him?

181
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,769
I don't know.

182
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,409
Let's go.

183
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,710
Your food isn't here yet.

184
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,809
Excuse me.
The meat I ordered is to go.

185
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,720
- Okay.
- Thanks for paying.

186
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,090
Bye.

187
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,690
That would be 16 dollars and...

188
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,500
124 dollars, please.

189
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,870
124 dollars?

190
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,110
Even I can't afford to eat beef.

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,980
Here. Twice more to go.

192
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,750
You owe me this much...

193
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:45,750
for keeping your phone safe.

194
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,750
Don't give me that look.

195
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,320
See you.

196
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,590
Hey. Try wearing something cute.

197
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,200
You have to make up
for your gloomy face.

198
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,769
I'll give you one more tip,

199
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,039
and this comes from experience.

200
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,970
Stay away from Jung.

201
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,070
There's more to him than you think.

202
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,980
See you.

203
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,220
Why does he talk so badly about him?

204
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,919
What's this about?

205
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,029
I don't get it.

206
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,590
You?

207
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,169
Were you following me?

208
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,600
- What?
- Why?

209
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,100
Why are you following me?

210
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,870
You're weird. You followed me.

211
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,740
Look. I'm ahead and you're behind.

212
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,509
Are you stupid?

213
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,610
Do you live here?

214
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,480
- No.
- I think you do.

215
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,789
- No, I don't.
- Why are you here, then?

216
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,090
Gosh. I forgot
where I was going.

217
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,090
- You do live nearby.
- I do not.

218
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,399
She really is stupid.

219
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,529
She is a terrible liar.

220
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,899
So she lives nearby?

221
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,470
I can't wait until Jung finds out.

222
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,379
You do live here.

223
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,639
Thanks for the food.

224
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,159
My goodness.
We live in the same neighbourhood?

225
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,230
That's just weird.

226
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,710
- See you, Mad Hair.
- "See you, Mad Hair."

227
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,009
- Baek In Ho.
- "Baek In Ho"?

228
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,620
What?

229
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,019
My number...

230
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:04,220
Who is this guy?

231
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,190
He's a freak.

232
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,899
What more does he want from me?

233
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,779
How weird.

234
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,210
Now let's...

235
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,519
- Sang Cheol.
- What? Okay, okay.

236
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,919
I'm listening.

237
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,889
Our presentation will be on
how Elen Electronics...

238
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,789
established a successful strategy
in South Africa.

239
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,000
Sang Cheol, you look into
South Africa's electronics industry.

240
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,200
How am I supposed to do
all that research?

241
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,100
It'll all be in English
and I've never been there.

242
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,009
Gosh. Could you at least unpack
your stuff before you complain?

243
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,879
And I can smell alcohol from here.

244
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,980
- Did you wash your face?
- I did.

245
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,950
Seol, I'm really sorry
I have to say this, but...

246
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,950
could you share
a little bit of my workload?

247
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,889
I divided the workload
pretty evenly.

248
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,460
Seol.

249
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,389
Where do we find
all this information?

250
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,600
Do we contact Elen Electronics...

251
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,029
Let's...

252
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,899
- Sorry.
- It's taken.

253
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,500
Hey, there you are.

254
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,809
I can't do any work
because you won't...

255
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,309
lend me your laptop.

256
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,110
- I need it, too.
- Buy one.

257
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,610
Why should I when
I can borrow yours?

258
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,480
- Who's she?
- Her?

259
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,379
I'm Hong Seol and
I'm in the third year.

260
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,820
So you're Hong Seol.
I heard you're the top student.

261
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,889
I'm Min Do Hyun. We never met.

262
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,190
- Hello.
- Let's go somewhere else.

263
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,360
- Let's go.
- We'll be done soon...

264
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,299
- I smell alcohol.
- Listen up.

265
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,000
Be quiet and go away.

266
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
As you know,
I'm not feeling well...

267
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,809
and I'm in no mood for a meeting.

268
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,610
Let's call it a day.
This meeting's over.

269
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,210
- Look into the industry and...
- I've never been there.

270
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,419
- What can I do?
- Find information.

271
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,320
- I have no passport.
- He won't help.

272
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,120
He's off to drink again.

273
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,259
He'll ruin things for us. He will.

274
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,289
How about we finish off
by suggesting Samjin switches to...

275
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,299
a luxury department store?

276
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,230
Good idea. Their target market
was a bit random and disorganised.

277
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,169
Then I'll revise the file...

278
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,600
and write the draft of
our final report.

279
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,870
You'll do all that?

280
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,110
Bravo.

281
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,980
I did my fair share,
so does that mean I can relax?

282
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,679
See you.

283
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,779
Oh, right.

284
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,250
Is Hong Seol seeing anyone?

285
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,389
- Why?
- Studious girls like her...

286
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,960
can be surprisingly hot and
adventurous.

287
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,070
Gosh.
Why didn't I notice her sooner?

288
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm off, Jung. See you.

289
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,110
She's still doing it alone.

290
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,179
I'd have been pretty useful
in her team.

291
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,019
Do you know you two
are quite similar?

292
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,090
You both lose out because
others take advantage of you.

293
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,789
You seem to be fine
but what about her?

294
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,960
She's stuck with Sang Cheol
and no one can deal with him.

295
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,210
Let's postpone our next meeting.

296
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,309
I can't make it.

297
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,620
We can't. We all take
different lectures.

298
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,549
So it's hard to set a time.

299
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,289
Then do it without me.

300
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,269
How can we do that
when you have things to share?

301
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,700
Can't you do my part for me?

302
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,410
Then we might all get an A+.

303
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,109
What is his problem?

304
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,809
Are you asking me to...

305
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,220
Seol, I added a picture
in the report...

306
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,890
and the letters moved. What do I do?

307
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,519
Go into Tools...

308
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,289
How do you do that?

309
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,299
Why am I doing everything
for everybody?

310
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,630
I still have exams to study for.

311
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,180
You're the one who makes me drink!

312
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,410
I just can't afford it.

313
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,319
I have to hurry.

314
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,230
Why...

315
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:17,500
Why is no one else here?

316
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,210
What do they want me to do?

317
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,410
Where are they?

318
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,519
Sorry. I fell asleep
and couldn't wake up in time.

319
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,619
Are you still there?

320
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,720
If I hurry I can be there by 9pm.

321
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,259
I'm really sorry. Something really
important came up.

322
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,799
Seol, I really need you to
help me out this once.

323
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,900
(Kim Sang Cheol)

324
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,109
Let's get wasted!

325
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,380
- Let's drink more!
- What a jerk.

326
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,190
- Drink.
- Let's drink.

327
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:20,299
Seol, what are you doing here?

328
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,930
Had you forgotten about our meeting?

329
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,900
Oh, that?

330
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,099
It's such an important gathering.

331
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,009
It is. It is.

332
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,180
- Sang Cheol!
- How did you know I was here?

333
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,980
Did you come by to tell me
how the meeting went?

334
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,319
How kind of you.

335
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,920
Seol.

336
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,720
We met, haven't we?
Why are you here?

337
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:47,019
I'm sure our team's getting an A+.

338
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:50,589
I have a team captain
who comes to update the members.

339
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,960
- Isn't that awesome?
- I'm impressed.

340
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,299
Why did you skip the meeting?

341
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
- Pour her a make-up drink.
- No.

342
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,069
Come on, just one drink.

343
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,509
- Just one.
- Sit.

344
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,109
Sang Cheol, pour her a drink.

345
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,309
- Why not? Pass me the soju.
- Here.

346
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,950
Drink this and cheer up.

347
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,920
Empty the glass
and I promise I'll study.

348
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,519
We'll get an A+ next time. Here.

349
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,089
- No? Guys, chant. Hong...
- Hong...

350
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,029
- Hong, Hong.
- Hong, Hong.

351
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,730
- Hong, Hong.
- Hong, Hong.

352
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,299
She's drinking it.

353
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,509
Clap, clap.

354
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,480
Not bad.

355
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,079
I'm so proud of you.

356
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,509
I'll keep my word.

357
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,420
What is it? Is something missing?

358
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,589
Yes. My printout of
the marketing case study.

359
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,230
I think Do Hyun read it earlier.

360
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,210
- Hello?
- Hey, Jung.

361
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,509
What's up?

362
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,210
I think you took my printout
by mistake.

363
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,109
The marketing case study.

364
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,779
Hang on.

365
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,119
- One more. Hong...
- Hong...

366
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,619
- One more drink, one more drink.
- One more drink, one more drink.

367
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,089
It's here. I must have
taken it by mistake.

368
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,859
What should we do?

369
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,200
I'll come and get it.

370
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,299
Is Seol with them?

371
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,640
I guess so.

372
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,299
She's playing a dangerous game.

373
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,609
She's hanging out with trash.

374
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,309
- "Trash"?
- He's made his name...

375
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,710
by messing with women.

376
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,509
He'd get girls drunk
and take them to a motel to...

377
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:53,980
He sounded so sleazy
when he said hello to Seol that day.

378
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,190
I have to go.

379
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,490
Are you feeling okay?

380
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,559
- Yes.
- Drink up.

381
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,400
Here.

382
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,000
I think I should go.

383
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,200
You can't leave already.
Things are just getting heated up.

384
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,470
Seol.

385
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:17,839
- Sang Cheol.
- What?

386
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,410
We don't have much time left.

387
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,109
Send me the information I asked for.

388
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,119
- I'll put everything together.
- Okay, okay.

389
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,549
You're retaking the course.

390
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,490
You're making it really hard...

391
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,789
for everyone else.

392
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,660
I need your help. Please save me.

393
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,900
Okay, I will.

394
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,400
Help the poor girl out.

395
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,869
- Pinky swear.
- Sit back down, Seol.

396
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,799
- Just a moment.
- Sit down.

397
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,410
Seol, have just one more drink
before you go home.

398
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,240
- Here.
- No.

399
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,579
I'd rather leave.

400
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:59,420
Okay, then. I'll walk you.
I'll take you home.

401
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,220
You look pretty drunk yourself.

402
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,420
I'll take her home.

403
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,089
Jung.

404
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:07,890
When did he...

405
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,000
I can walk just fine.

406
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,930
I told you to look after yourself.

407
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Are you trying to get into trouble?

408
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:21,609
- Why are you...
- Why can't you say no?

409
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,609
Do you think everyone's
like you? They aren't.

410
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,680
But Sang Cheol...

411
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,049
Sang Cheol said...

412
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,180
You're hurting me.

413
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,960
Get a grip.

414
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,859
I... Wait, Jung...

415
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:52,869
Wait.

416
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,009
- Drive safely.
- No, wait.

417
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,009
Jung, you're mistaken.

418
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,480
Jung.

419
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,549
Hey.

420
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,119
What was that about?

421
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,619
Do you think you're all that because
people lavish praise?

422
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,789
Who are you to interfere...

423
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,259
I don't care what you do
anywhere else.

424
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,829
But I don't think you should
act like this around campus.

425
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,940
- What?
- You scored an intern job.

426
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,869
Does the company know
what you get up to?

427
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,640
You aren't that cool at all.

428
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,109
You're threatening me
when you have nothing.

429
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,650
Do you really want to do this?

430
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,920
You've been pretty sloppy lately.

431
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,519
Is this about Seol?

432
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,730
I'm just disgusted.

433
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,299
I'm very squeamish, you see.

434
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,839
I hope you clean up your act.

435
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
Unless you never want to work a day
for the rest of your life.

436
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Get over it.

437
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,359
What did I do wrong?

438
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:10,410
It's too much.

439
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,809
It's just too much.

440
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,250
The door is closing.

441
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,769
Hello, Father.

442
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,210
What the heck.

443
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,210
You'll regret that forever.

444
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,019
Why did they fire me?

445
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,950
Am I too handsome to serve food?

446
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,390
Is it a crime to be handsome?

447
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,690
- Yes.
- In Ho.

448
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,299
Mr. Yu.

449
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:10,769
Your sister told me that
you were back.

450
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:13,299
Why didn't you call me?

451
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,140
Sorry. I was going to.

452
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,549
I'd like you and your sister
to come over.

453
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,849
It's been too long.

454
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:27,849
I missed you so much.

455
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,890
See you tomorrow.

456
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:33,289
Okay.

457
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,869
- We came this far.
- It's just wrong.

458
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,210
No, no. Come back here.

459
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,619
Smile.

460
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,190
Hello, Jung.

461
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,500
What's wrong?

462
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,299
Is it because
we haven't met in a while?

463
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,900
Let's go inside.
We can't make Mr. Yu wait.

464
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,539
That jerk.

465
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,779
It's been so long since
we last met.

466
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,019
It has.

467
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,289
Jung's too busy
to call or meet up with us.

468
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,890
It's great to see you both.

469
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,660
In Ho, how have you been?

470
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,529
What have you been up to?

471
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,200
Just... This and that.

472
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,069
I'm glad you're finally back.

473
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:01,279
Tell me if you need anything.

474
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,180
Jung, look out for him, will you?

475
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,019
Sure.

476
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,690
Mr. Yu, can't I live here forever
with you and Jung?

477
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,190
- That would be...
- Hey. Be quiet.

478
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,990
Jung. Isn't the semester
ending soon?

479
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,430
Mr. Yu, how about
we all go travelling together?

480
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,400
- Try some of this.
- Thank you.

481
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,329
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

482
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,869
In Ho.

483
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,880
I know you're upset with us.

484
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,650
Forget about the past and
go back to playing the piano.

485
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,359
I don't care about that anymore.

486
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,019
You don't have to worry about me.

487
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,829
How can I not?

488
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm still young.
I'll find something to do.

489
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,900
And I'm grateful enough
that...

490
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
you looked after me until now.

491
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,839
- In Ho.
- I really...

492
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,710
don't need anything.

493
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,980
And...

494
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,779
it was good to see you.

495
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,920
Okay, then.

496
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,589
Let's think about what to do.

497
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,789
Bye, then.

498
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,190
I should go.

499
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,160
Bye. See you soon.

500
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,009
Won't you drive us back?
I don't want to take a taxi.

501
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,319
Jung, how about the three of us
go out to drink?

502
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,119
Why are you so distant?

503
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,160
Don't you know why?

504
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,230
When will you grow up?

505
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,599
You seem to want to
leech off of us forever.

506
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:01,500
Do you think that'll work?

507
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,299
- If you have a brain, use it.
- No.

508
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,269
This is the only thing I'm good at.
Why would I stop?

509
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,980
You could just be nice to me.

510
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,309
That would make everyone happy.

511
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,079
Think about it.

512
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:26,720
Let's go.

513
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,130
Hey, come back!

514
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,900
I thought we'd never meet again.
Why are you here?

515
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,039
Do you think I wanted to be here?

516
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,170
I had no choice but to show up.

517
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,380
I saw the look on your face.

518
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,480
You weren't able to
show your dislike.

519
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,019
Too bad. But I think your father
doesn't think the way you do.

520
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,289
His only son ruined
another man's life.

521
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,630
I think he feels guilty.

522
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,660
You always blame others.

523
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,099
Is it my father's fault that
he got you two out of that mess?

524
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,269
Is it my fault you hurt your hand?

525
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,839
If you really want to blame someone,

526
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,970
blame yourself for disappearing when
he said he'd pay for your treatment.

527
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,180
My treatment?

528
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:21,809
Is that all you can say?

529
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,410
If you hate hearing me mention that,

530
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,349
take your sister and get lost.

531
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,089
You jerk.

532
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,099
What gives you the right
to look down on everyone else?

533
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,400
Do you think everything
will go your way?

534
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,900
Do you hate it that much
that two poor kids...

535
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,539
are taking what's yours?

536
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,599
Hit me. Hit me if you can.

537
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,210
Punch me instead of trying to
control me from behind.

538
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,309
Hit me!

539
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,309
That's for the mirror.

540
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,119
Hey, let me in. Hey!

541
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,059
Hey!

542
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:46,630
The presentation's tomorrow.
Why hasn't anyone sent me anything?

543
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,039
Why aren't they replying?

544
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,640
They haven't checked their messages.

545
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,079
He's logged on to Facebook...

546
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,050
but he's ignoring my messages?

547
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,690
Fine.

548
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,789
I quit.

549
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,659
We can all fail.

550
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,570
Let's just sleep.

551
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,610
No.

552
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,480
Get a grip, Seol.

553
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,380
If I mess this up,

554
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,719
and I won't be able to get
the scholarship.

555
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,719
What's the point in getting angry?
It's all about the grades.

556
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:10,510
I'm done.

557
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,059
One hour.

558
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,960
I can sleep for an hour.

559
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,199
The presentation.

560
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:39,010
None of them will know what to say.

561
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,820
We need a script.

562
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,420
I'm really sorry, Seol.

563
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,929
My brother broke my PC
and the repair guy never came.

564
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:00,599
I fell asleep after
taking my cold medicine. Sorry.

565
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,699
I drank too much
and now I feel sick.

566
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,099
I have no energy to complain.

567
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,170
Memorise that.
I typed up your scripts.

568
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:13,409
- Did you really?
- You're the best.

569
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,719
Is everyone ready?

571
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,219
I expect much from this class.

572
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,420
- We'll start with Team One.
- Okay.

573
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,030
Please listen carefully.

574
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,400
- My goodness.
- Hello, everyone.

575
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:45,010
Our presentation is on Elen
Electronics' strategy in China.

576
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:49,309
We are Team One and
our presentation begins now!

577
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,820
Elen Electronics' smartphones
are currently selling...

578
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,989
at a dismal rate within China,
according to our research.

579
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,860
- And so...
- Hey.

580
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:04,789
Will you stop moving around?

581
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,960
Oh. Yes, Professor.

582
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,769
I can tell right away that he got
the slides from a conference.

583
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,900
He's a snake oil merchant.

584
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,869
Let's go deeper.

585
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,110
I'm Jung Se Hyun from Team Two.

586
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,510
I'll begin our presentation.

587
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,210
We analysed the profits
from the last five years...

588
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,920
and concluded that
hardware sales and import...

589
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,719
have been decreasing.

590
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:33,989
Stop. Did she say
something's decreasing?

591
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,929
- Yes.
- Your voice is decreasing.

592
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,429
I can't hear a word
you're saying. Can you?

593
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,760
- No, we can't.
- See?

594
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,500
- Say "ah".
- Ah.

595
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,199
- Ah.
- Ah.

596
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,800
It's still the same.

597
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:51,039
Speak up. No one can hear you.

598
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,409
Try again.

599
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,409
So why are they selling
fewer and fewer consoles?

600
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,880
Are there problems with the product?

601
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,519
You have problems.

602
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:05,789
Are you sick?

603
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,960
You look sad.
Did you break-up recently?

604
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,429
This is for you.

605
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,099
Our team came up with
a strategy for Black Edition,

606
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,199
a Korean company that was once
famous for its MP3 players,

607
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,000
to survive in
the international market.

608
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,510
Here's an example of
Black Edition's strength,

609
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,409
its unbelievably good audio quality.

610
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,219
- Press play.
- It's not working.

611
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,719
- It's mute.
- Is it not working?

612
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,920
If they're all like this,
we still have a chance.

613
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,090
Samjin Department Store's motto was
"Put Customers First".

614
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,199
They targeted the masses...

615
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,599
and expanded quickly within Korea.

616
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,000
They're first in sales
and percentage of market shares,

617
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:56,070
but their business profit rate
is lower than their competitors.

618
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:59,480
Yu Jung never disappoints.

619
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,679
- He's so cool.
- To overcome that,

620
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,809
Samjin must come up with
a new strategy.

621
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,550
- Yes.
- Thank you for listening.

622
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,690
Very nice, very nice.
That was well done.

623
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:16,190
Good job.

624
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,489
- Team Five?
- Yes.

625
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,050
We will begin our presentation.

626
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,489
I didn't do a terrible job
of putting things together.

627
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,989
We might not get an A+
but we should get an A,

628
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,190
if the others do okay.

629
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,960
Elen Electronics
established its first store...

630
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,969
in Johannesburg in 1996.

631
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,869
Most of their profits come from
digital home appliances...

632
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,309
and audio-video equipment
and middle-class...

633
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,510
that they sell.

634
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,809
They sell what?

635
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,510
Middle-class...

636
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,320
They don't sell middle-class,
they sell it to them.

637
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,150
To the middle-class, I mean...

638
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,519
Stop, stop.

639
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,420
I noticed that...

640
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:23,190
all you do is to
read off your sheet.

641
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,800
You don't seem to care at all
for the people who are listening.

642
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,699
- I apologise.
- What year are you in?

643
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,030
The third year.

644
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,199
Anyone in his or her
third year at university...

645
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,409
should know the basics of
giving a presentation.

646
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

647
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,110
- Yes.
- Yes.

648
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,510
They said I'm right.

649
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,480
- Sorry.
- Will you try again or what?

650
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,550
Will we get a B at least?

651
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,019
I'll try again. Sorry.

652
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,420
No, forget it.

653
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:55,389
I don't think you should.

654
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,059
Listen up, everyone.

655
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,429
I noticed something else.

656
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,199
I don't think you have any idea...

657
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,269
what you are or should be
talking about.

658
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,099
Did you do the research?

659
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,940
- Yes.
- Hong Seol.

660
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:15,610
- Yes?
- Explain the strategy...

661
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,849
Elen Electronics' employed
in South Africa.

662
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,320
The South African government
abolished tariffs to attract...

663
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,219
- foreign investment...
- Sang Cheol.

664
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,019
- Yes?
- You must have...

665
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,159
researched about tariffs
and foreign investment.

666
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,929
How are the two connected?

667
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,659
That would be...

668
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:33,599
I can explain instead.

669
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,500
No, not you. You.

670
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,869
Right.

671
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:40,139
So if a company
doesn't have to pay tariffs,

672
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,570
- it helps export, no import...
- Stop.

673
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:45,610
- You, Da Young.
- Yes?

674
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,010
Will they invest
or receive investments?

675
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,210
- Yes.
- What?

676
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:50,510
- Pardon?
- What?

677
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,579
- They'll receive investment.
- What?

678
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,119
Or not.

679
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,019
What a mess.

680
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,789
I'll never get a B. Will I get a C?

681
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:07,099
C? That is unbelievable.

682
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,769
I had a look at the report.

683
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:13,469
It's nicely done.
They did very well.

684
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,099
But...

685
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,309
anyone can tell right away.

686
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,409
One person did all the work.

687
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,280
I warned you.

688
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:28,219
I told you never to get caught.

689
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:31,789
Team Five.

690
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,630
You will all get a D.

691
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,699
No way.

692
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:50,940
No exceptions.

693
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,739
- Sit down.
- Professor.

694
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,179
Go back to your seat.

695
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,880
Or go home.

696
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Who on earth is clapping?

697
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:09,460
I must say that...

698
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,829
of all the presentations I've heard,

699
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,030
this was the worst.

700
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,829
Everyone.

701
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,769
I am disappointed.

702
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,500
I've had enough.

703
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,639
Let's call it a day.

704
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

705
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,710
I'm really sorry, Seol.

706
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:35,619
When you're under pressure,
you forget things you know.

707
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:38,920
Min Soo, you stuttered way too much.

708
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,929
I'm never good at speaking
in front of people.

709
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,630
Gosh. Do you think
it's easy for us then?

710
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,130
You have no right to complain.

711
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,599
What will you do about it now?

712
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,739
You've been free-riding
too many times.

713
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,309
You're the one
who couldn't answer.

714
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,139
I at least answered.

715
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:02,039
Seol, just get over it.

716
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,750
We all get a D every now and then.

717
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,119
Think of it positively, okay?

718
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:11,289
Seol, I'm really sorry.

719
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:13,820
We messed it all up.

720
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,860
We'd have done better
if I'd gone first.

721
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,630
What difference
would that have made?

722
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,929
She did the individual assignment.

723
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:34,139
It's just a D and she's acting like...
her whole life is crashing down.

724
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,010
I know.

725
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:39,550
I told her I was sick
and she didn't even care.

726
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,980
That is insane.
What team are they in?

727
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:44,920
What is it?

728
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:48,920
Do you have to give me a D, too?

729
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,460
I really did work hard.

730
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,960
You really did, all alone.

731
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,500
Don't you see that is
your biggest problem?

732
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:04,840
Seol, I've been watching you
for quite a while.

733
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,679
You think you're diligent
and have great work ethic.

734
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:13,420
And that no one else
can meet your standards,

735
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,019
so you did it all yourself.

736
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,090
That was the easy way out.

737
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:21,519
You might have done well so far...

738
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,789
by working hard and alone,

739
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,800
but you can't survive
in a society all alone.

740
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,969
You're studying Business.

741
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,769
What is Business Management?
It's about communication.

742
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,369
You must communicate.

743
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:37,739
Do you get what I mean?

744
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,039
Go. There are no exceptions.

745
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,760
This is my first ever D.

746
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:04,929
- Hong.
- Hong.

747
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,300
How did it go?

748
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,940
I bet you got an A+.

749
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:11,409
Right?

750
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:13,409
No?

751
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,050
You had the worst teammates.

752
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,150
Just ace the final exam.
You're smart.

753
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,820
And when the holidays start,

754
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,889
the three of us can go travelling.

755
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,829
Eun Taek and I talked about it.
How about Busan?

756
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:33,730
We can eat raw fish
as we look out at the sea.

757
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,030
Do what you want.

758
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,929
Don't you want to go to Busan?

759
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,639
It's not that.

760
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,940
If you don't like the sea,
how about a mountain?

761
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:45,440
We could go to Mount Jirisan.

762
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,010
Or Namiseom Island, which is closer.

763
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,380
I said do what you want.

764
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,250
I told you once already.
So stop it.

765
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,889
Hey, why are you upset?

766
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,659
I was just throwing out ideas.

767
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,619
Professor Kang gave me a D.

768
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:05,389
I might lose the scholarship.

769
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,329
- I'm not in the mood for this.
- Then you should've said so.

770
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,130
Why are you mad at me?

771
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,639
I kept asking because
your answer was so vague.

772
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,199
What did I do wrong?

773
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,239
You're always like that.

774
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,739
You never say what you're thinking.

775
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,579
I can't go travelling.

776
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,849
I can't even afford my tuition.
Happy now?

777
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:28,920
If something upsets you, say so.
Don't make me feel bad instead.

778
00:47:29,019 --> 00:47:32,650
This is a private matter
and discussing about it upsets me.

779
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:35,519
It's not like
talking about it will help.

780
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,690
That's not the issue.

781
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:42,329
You never tell me how you feel
or what you're thinking.

782
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,730
I have to go.

783
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,539
Bo Ra.

784
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,940
Did you have to fight?

785
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,079
Are you okay?

786
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,750
Go talk to her.

787
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,480
Cheer her up.

788
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,510
Seol.

789
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,840
Gosh. Why is your bag so heavy?

790
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,239
What's going on?

791
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,469
It's been a while.

792
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,579
You still have to buy me
two more dinners.

793
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,250
Give me that.

794
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,820
I'll walk you home.

795
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,929
Is something wrong?

796
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:58,599
No.

797
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,300
That's a lie.

798
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:02,539
Something is wrong.

799
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:05,570
You tend to look older
when something's wrong.

800
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,110
Hey.

801
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,280
What?

802
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,420
Everyone says I wasted my life.

803
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,420
What should I do in times like this?

804
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,920
What did you want to say?

805
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,030
Never mind.

806
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,530
She'd dig herself a grave.

807
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,639
I'm not in the mood for this.

808
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:40,340
I don't know what's bothering you,

809
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:41,940
but cool down and let go.

810
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,210
Extra baggage hurts no one but you.

811
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,250
Here.

812
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,019
Sugar is great when
you're depressed. Bye.

813
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,420
Give me my bag.

814
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,190
Take it.

815
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,730
Baek In Ho.

816
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,230
Baek In Ha.

817
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,079
- Father, it's me.
- Hello.

818
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,849
I wanted to talk about
In Ho and In Ha.

819
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:54,719
Really? What about them?

820
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,820
They're both adults, so instead of
supporting financially,

821
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:02,920
shouldn't we help them
stand on their two feet?

822
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,590
In Ho said...

823
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:09,230
he doesn't want our help.

824
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,929
We'll start with In Ha.

825
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,099
How about giving her a job?

826
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,639
In accounting or
database department.

827
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,179
That's a good idea.

828
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,079
If she were to get a licence,

829
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,780
you could hire her yourself.

830
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,349
Will she agree, though?

831
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:29,889
- I'll talk to her.
- Okay.

832
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,489
I'm glad that you seem to
care about them.

833
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,030
You haven't seen In Ho
in a while, so try to get along.

834
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:40,960
I will.

835
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,750
Hello, Jung. I can't believe
you actually called me.

836
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,420
A licence?

837
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:07,820
Take lessons? Data...
You want me to take classes?

838
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,489
Jung!

839
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:13,500
Why are you so mean to me?
You know I hate those things.

840
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,130
You don't think
I'll actually attend, do you?

841
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,630
What are you talking about?
Get to the point.

842
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,139
Hey, what did you just do?

843
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,710
Listen carefully, In Ha.

844
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,340
Who are you to tell me what to do?

845
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:29,949
- I'm paying a fortune...
- This is your last chance.

846
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,250
Look at what you've done!

847
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,030
Yes. This is the right thing to do.

848
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,030
So much has gone wrong.

849
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,329
Team Five. You'll all get a D.

850
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,579
I had no time to care about
anything else.

851
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,420
My sole focus was to keep going...

852
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,920
without stumbling or falling.

853
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,789
I thought I'd lived harder
than anyone else.

854
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,230
Here are your Americanos.

855
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:57,329
No one else can meet your standards,

856
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,869
so you did it all yourself.

857
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,039
That was the easy way out.

858
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,210
Where did it all go wrong?

859
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:16,519
If I can blame no one else
but me for all this...

860
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,090
See, women think differently
from us men.

861
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,260
They never served in the army.

862
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,130
When you work as a group,

863
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,489
the group pays for
one person's mistake.

864
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,360
Getting a D isn't a big deal.

865
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,230
What a joke. Gosh.

866
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,239
Everything got tangled up.

867
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,239
An exam?

868
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,849
Yes.

869
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,750
Good luck.

870
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:52,119
I have no idea where to start...

871
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,559
untangling this utter mess.

872
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:31,460
All I can do...

873
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,829
is doing what must be done
right now.

874
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:42,739
Jung.

875
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:12,730
I apologise.

876
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:17,239
I set you up with a friend
without asking what you thought.

877
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,780
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

878
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,050
I didn't befriend you
so I could set you up with Ah Young.

879
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:29,219
The more I got to know you...

880
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,449
the more I thought
you were a nice person.

881
00:57:33,019 --> 00:57:35,559
That's why
I introduced Ah Young to you.

882
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,900
Sorry if you didn't like it.

883
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,730
I'm sorry, too.

884
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,139
I acted like a kid.

885
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,940
I was embarrassed and frustrated.

886
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,739
Frustrated? About what?

887
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,920
Let's not feel bad
about each other.

888
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,019
Okay.

889
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,530
Are you free this evening?

890
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:17,230
How about I buy you dinner?

891
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:22,599
We didn't get to eat last time,
so I owe you.

892
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,340
Let's eat something expensive.

893
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,039
What's your budget?

894
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:33,510
Well... How much is it?

895
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:39,820
How much did you have in mind?

896
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,690
Eat whatever you want.

897
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:04,750
Aren't I good now?

898
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,750
You are.

899
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,519
Well done.
It's quite hard.

900
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:11,489
I practised a lot.

901
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,019
Here you go.

902
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,610
What is it?

903
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:44,349
I'm glad that we made up.

904
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:48,019
It had bothered me.

905
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,929
Me, too.

906
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,829
I don't think so.

907
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:54,460
I pretended it didn't.

908
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:58,400
Stay away from Jung.

909
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,139
There's more to him than you think.

910
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:05,309
Do you know someone
called Baek In Ho?

911
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,710
He's tall and speaks directly.

912
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,710
He acts like a delinquent.

913
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,820
How do you know him?

914
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:21,820
I lost my phone once
and he found it for me.

915
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,230
He seemed to know you well.

916
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,230
Just ignore him next time.

917
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:33,400
- And don't stay friends with him.
- Okay.

918
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:37,539
I don't think I should pry.

919
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:40,739
It's dark here. It's not safe
for a woman to walk alone.

920
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,840
I'll walk you from now on.

921
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,949
Well... No, you don't have to.

922
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:52,389
This is it. Thanks
for walking me home.

923
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,429
Thanks for walking me home.

924
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,039
I should go inside.

925
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:16,409
Seol.

926
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,550
Yes?

927
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,050
Would you be my girlfriend?

928
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:06,130
I don't know why you said that.

929
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,929
- Are you sure?
- Sorry.

930
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,530
Why are you here?

931
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,929
I'm here to see Seol.

932
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,829
Did you miss me? I missed you.

933
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,739
I'll be coming by often.
Let's go on a date.

934
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,639
No way. It's unbelievable.
It doesn't make sense.

935
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:20,840
What do you think
he likes about Seol?

936
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,239
- What?
- This isn't cute at all.

937
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:25,409
Does she know what you're like?

938
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,150
- That jerk!
- Good job.

939
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,619
I told you to stay away.

940
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,119
Mad Hair.

941
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,019
Sorry, but I won't pack and leave
if that's what you want.

942
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,630
I told you to stay away from him.

943
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,329
I won't help out if you end up
getting betrayed.

944
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:43,530
Why on earth did he
ask me to date him?

945
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,000
Jung, wait.
