Let's go.

To be honest,
I resent Sang Cheol, too.

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,289
That's why I pretended
not to know about it.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,159
So how could I criticise you?

13
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,929
You did it because of me.

14
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,170
From some point in time,

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,180
I think that I started thinking
it's okay...

16
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,579
as long as you're not
doing it to me.

17

But...

18

you know that the heartaches
you cause...

19

will eventually
all come back to you.

I don't want you to
do those things to other people.

To me, you're such a good person.

You can be like that
to other people, too.

31
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,060
Why is he silent?

32
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,500
Everything at his school and work
must've turned into a fiasco by now.

33
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,569
He must've had a fight
with that girl, too.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,740
Hong Seol, that girl. She's a lot
more persistent than she seems.

35
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,780
So this isn't enough for you, is it?

I'm calling because I'd like to
arrange a meeting with Mr. Yu.

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,590
There's something
I have to tell him.

40
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,759
Is he on a business trip?

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400

Hello?

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,180
Yes.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,949
Why are you calling so early?

You're here.

I'm so sorry about
what happened last time.

Oh, that? Don't worry about it.

50
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,360
I spoke to the president for you.

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,569
I told him that you had
a personal emergency.

52
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,300
Go in and tell him the same thing.

53
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,139
Right. I heard that you know
people in Taerang Group.

54
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,939
Why didn't you tell me?
I had no idea.

55

Anyway, give your best
when you start working here.

- Come with me.

- You should go see the president.

- Are you not going to work?
- The president?

59

Wow. Someone must be thrilled.

60
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,800
She doesn't have to worry about
money or getting a job.

61
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,810
Hey, Seol. Have a seat.
Sit down.

62
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,709
Is the rumour true?

63

Is Jung's father really
the president of Taerang Group?

Wow. I guess it's true.

You had no idea either, right?

67

Seol. That's the reason why
you started dating him, right?

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,290
Keep it down so that we can study.
We have an exam.

69
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,529
This is a lot more important
than the exam.

70
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,459
Hey, Seol. Tell us.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Everyone, be quiet.

72
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,699
Is the rumour really true?

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,939
You should've at least told us.
I feel betrayed.

74
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,040
It looks like people will
give you a hard time for it.

76
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,379
What are you going to do?

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,410
I'm more worried about
how you'll do on the exam.

78
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,379
I've been too easy on you, it seems.
You're being so cheeky.

Hey.

80
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,089
Do you really have
that much to talk about?

81
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,319
Are you not going to take the exam?

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,220
Isn't Seol like Cinderella?

83
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,189
Are we going to the same school
as the chairman's son?

84
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm telling you. Seol knew about it
from the get-go.

85
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,269
Wasn't she single her whole life
before that?

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,930
Why else would she have been
so motivated to date him?

87
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,470
Had I known about it, I would've
dated Jung myself.

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,740
- Me, too!
- Same here!

89
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,639
Goodness.
You girls are too much.

90
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,839
By the way, I think Sang Cheol
didn't get into Taerang Group...

91
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,910
because of Jung.

92
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,709
- Why?
- Didn't you hear?

93
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,379
I heard that Sang Cheol caused
a scene at Taerang Group.

94
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,750
From what I heard, he was demanding
Jung to show up, saying that...

95
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,319
he didn't get the job
because of Jung.

96
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,790
So did he intentionally tell him to
apply just to reject him?

97
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,129
- Exactly.
- That's crazy. Goodness.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
- Why? What happened?
- What's going on?

99
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,759
Sang Cheol basically harassed Seol.

100
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,769
Why would Jung want him
to work at his dad's company?

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,170
Even I was being asked
by everyone all day long.

102
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,470
People whom I've never even seen
came up to me...

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,339
and asked if Jung's father
really owns Taerang Group.

104
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,379
People are so nosy.

105
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,910
This is probably why Jung has
kept it a secret all these years.

106
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,050
People were all over him
even when they didn't know.

107
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,079
It would've been a lot worse
if they knew.

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,620
Totally. I'm glad that Jung isn't
on campus on a day like this.

109
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,660
Seol, don't worry too much.

110
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:29,329
We'll pretend that we don't know
anything in front of him.

111
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,860
Thanks.

112
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,139
What are these?
Are they matching rings?

113
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,610
I told you that she'd be surprised.

114
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,439
I figured I needed to let the world
know that Bo Ra is my girlfriend.

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,649
Don't ever pretend that
you're single, okay?

116
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,779
What? What kind of person
do you think I am?

117
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,279
I'm happy for you two.

118
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,149
Why didn't you start dating sooner?

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,589
What kind of person?
You're my girlfriend.

120
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,129
Jung.

121
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,329
Thank you.

122
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,100
You have a lot of meeting notes
to organise, right?

123
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,740
Shall I help you
if there's too much?

124
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,509
It's okay. It's my job.

125
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,079
Would you like to join us for lunch?

126
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,079
You always eat at the cafeteria.

127
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,420
There's a really nice
Italian restaurant nearby.

128
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,019
Come with us.

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,759
I heard the food's nice.

130
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,519
No, thanks.

131
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,129
Okay.

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,569
Jung.

133
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,069
Are you here for coffee?

134
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Yes.

135
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,709
No. You made it for yourself.

136
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll make another one.

137
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,379
Thank you.

138
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,579
Isn't the third round of interviews
in two days?

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,990
My cousin applied, too, you see.

140
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,519
He did really well in college,

141
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,360
and he's a great guy.

142
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,490
Could you put in a good word?

143
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:11,959
Thank you for the coffee.

144
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,279
He must feel more uncomfortable
than me.

145
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,720
Going to practice?

146
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,519
What?

147
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,620
Yes.

148
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,990
What?

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,570
You're so strong.

150
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,100
That hurt.

151
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,299
You're stick thin but...

152
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,039
so strong.

153
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,710
You're weak, that's all.

154
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,480
Thanks.

155
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:03,809
For hitting me.

156
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,419
Oh, no. We're late.

157
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,490
We have to wait 20 minutes
if we miss the 45-minute train.

158
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,620
Run.

159
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,090
Wait up.

160
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,899
What? Hey.

161
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,700
I haven't seen you in so long.

162
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,500
You've become even more handsome.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,399
How about a beer later?

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,799
Stop it, girls.

165
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,539
Don't spend his money.

166
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,169
Jung. Why are you here?

167
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,009
I'm here to hand in my final paper.

168
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,580
Really?

169
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,379
Excuse us.

170
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
- But...
- Bye.

171
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,820
A beer...

172
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,379
Did I do well?

173
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,190
- You looked bored.
- Well done.

174
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,490
Jung. Let's talk.

175
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Wait here.

176
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,830
Don't worry. It's just a chat.

177
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,610
My senior at Sunju...

178
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,740
was pleased that he got
a Taerang contract.

179
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,210
Was that the price...

180
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,679
of getting me in?

181
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,750
Was it?

182
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,320
You mock me to the very end.

183
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,320
I know I acted like a fool.

184
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,490
But right now,

185
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,500
I can't bring myself to thank you.

186
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,960
Is that...

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,570
all you have to say?

188
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,700
You make it tough for yourself.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,470
Do you think people don't know?

190
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,840
You may think you
keep everything well hidden,

191
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,279
but everyone here knows
what you think of them,

192
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:44,080
and why you treat them
the way you do.

193
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,220
They all know
you don't show how you feel...

194
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,320
and that what you do show is fake.

195
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,519
You aren't the only one who judged.

196
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,960
We all judged you as well.

197
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,029
So don't belittle or taunt everyone
who tries to befriend you.

198
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,070
Some of them actually liked you.

199
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,840
Some of them...

200
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,370
really just wanted to
be your friend.

201
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:13,009
Sure.

202
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,950
We'll never meet again.

203
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,620
Sorry...

204
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,019
for everything.

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,399
What did Sang Cheol say?

206
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:40,809
Well...

207
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:42,940
Nothing much.

208
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,980
Okay.

209
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,580
Right.

210
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,549
I heard he got into
Sunju Logistics after all.

211
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,149
Isn't that a relief?

212
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,220
It is.

213
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,720
- Seol.
- Yes?

214
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,190
Holidays start right after
the finals, right?

215
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,789
Shall we go on a trip?

216
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,000
A trip?

217
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,629
You'll be really busy
once you start your fourth year,

218
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,600
and so will I.

219
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,870
Okay.

220
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,000
The mountains or the sea...

221
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,940
I want to go anywhere
and eat good food...

222
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,740
and see pretty things.

223
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,850
But can you stay out overnight?

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,179
Right...

225
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,419
You probably can't, right?

226
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,250
But don't most people...

227
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,919
lie when they go on such trips?

228
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,529
Think about it.

229
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,470
No parent would let
their daughter...

230
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,700
go on an overnight trip with her boyfriend
just like that.

231
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,379
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

232
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,179
I didn't say that.

233
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,019
What?

234
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,299
Thank you.

235
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,929
You're very welcome.

236
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,370
Jung.

237
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,309
Give me your hand.

238
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,610
My hand?

239
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,019
Quickly.

240
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,320
Is it too small?

241
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,990
It fits.

242
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,970
What kind of guy
doesn't buy his girlfriend...

243
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,009
a ring when they've been dating...

244
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,139
for over six months?

245
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,110
I couldn't stand it,
so I bought a pair.

246
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,279
Ta-da.

247
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,929
Say something.

248
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,429
Don't you like it?

249
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,039
No. No...

250
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,340
Thank you.

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,110
What should I do?

252
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,220
Don't ever take it off.

253
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,259
And don't lose it either.

254
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:52,600
Okay.

255
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,139
Bye.

256
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,230
What are you doing?

257
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,799
Are you dressed for an interview?

258
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,000
I guess you could say
I'm trying to get a job.

259
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,840
Wow. I can't believe
you're up so early.

260
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,840
Good for you.

261
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,409
Have a nice day, In Ho.

262
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,879
Don't change so drastically.

263
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,320
It's a bad omen.

264
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,820
Bye.

265
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,840
Mr. Choi, it's me, In Ha.

266
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,740
Yes. I should go to
his office, right?

267
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,419
I rented it for exactly one hour.
Practise as much as you can.

268
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,549
Okay?

269
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,079
That was great.

270
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,349
Who are you?

271
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,319
I have this space for one hour.

272
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,529
No, no.
I'm just happy to see you here.

273
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,359
We met once a long time ago
at Professor Noh's house.

274
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,859
I also saw you in
Professor Shin's office once.

275
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,400
I was sad because I didn't
get to say hi to you.

276
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,740
Since I was a kid, I have always...

277
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,640
idolised you.

278
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:51,640
I need to practise.

279
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,039
You're attending
the piano competition, right?

280
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,509
I'm actually one of the judges
for the preliminary round.

281
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,779
Professor Noh asked me to do it.

282
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,549
Professor Noh asked you?

283
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,690
I'm so looking forward
to the competition.

284
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,960
By the way, your hand...

285
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,529
Right, I'm keeping you from
practising. I'm sorry.

286
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,150
You know that we installed
a titanium rod when we were doing...

287
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,079
the operation for your open fracture
five years ago, right?

288
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,519
Yes.

289
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,349
But why is this happening
all of a sudden?

290
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,819
There was nothing wrong
a few months ago.

291
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,519
That was the case then.

292
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,789
But now, I see an infection around
one of the screws.

293
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,359
It's causing inflammation.

294
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,099
By any chance, did you recently
hurt your hand?

295
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,099
It could've been a scratch or a cut.

296
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,740
- Yes.
- Don't worry too much.

297
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:03,579
Getting a re-operation
will take care of the problem.

298
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,119
- Another operation?
- Yes.

299
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,779
After the operation,
it will take about two months...

300
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,920
for the bones to heal.

301
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,259
You should get the operation done
before the infection worsens.

302
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,730
And you must avoid doing anything
strenuous with your fingers.

303
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:20,930
Okay.

304
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,970
Please don't tell
Professor Shin anything for now.

305
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,839
I don't want to worry him.

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,740
Sure, I won't.

307
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,349
(Lesson Room)

308
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,819
What an idiot.

309
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,329
Goodness.

310
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,220
I'm so tired.

311
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,940
I need to focus now.

312
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,029
Coffee.

313
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,730
I need coffee.

314
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:04,829
What's this?

315
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,170
This is mine.

316
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:17,140
It's warm.

317
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,180
Jung is acting very strange
these days, isn't he?

318
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,589
He's being excessively sensitive
and on the edge.

319
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,190
I think that girl is
really influencing him.

320
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,490
I actually know her.

321
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,230
I think she approached him knowing
that he will inherit Taerang Group.

322
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,799
I really didn't want to
get involved in these things,

323
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,710
but this is just not acceptable.

324
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,710
You already know about
what happened here, right?

325
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,349
That also happened because of
a favour she asked him.

326
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,079
I just thought you should know.

327
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Jung!

328
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,819
The chairman is looking for you.

329
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,119
Is he back already?

330
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,589
I think he changed his schedule
around to come back earlier.

331
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,390
What are you doing?
Go to his office now.

332
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,349
Come in.

333
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,099
I heard that you wanted to see me.

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,809
I heard about everything that
happened here while I was gone.

335
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:37,549
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,250
Have a seat.

337
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:48,960
I checked with Mr. Moon too.

338
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,930
The applicant named Kim Sang Cheol.

339
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,900
We let him pass the first screening
because you asked.

340
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,799
To my face, you pretended that
you'd never do these things.

341
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,839
Have you been
telling people who you are...

342
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,609
and taking advantage of it?

343
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,440
All because of a girl?

344
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,549
I knew that you were dating someone,

345
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,819
but I had no idea that...

346
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,650
the girl would be this much
of a negative influence to you.

347
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,190
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- Take a good look at yourself.

348
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,190
I knew that something was up
when you started talking back to me.

349
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,329
And you even caused a scene
at work.

350
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,400
You're becoming a troublemaker.

351
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,470
I heard that you're being cold
towards In Ho and In Ha...

352
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,069
because of that girl.

353
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,000
I was just thinking that
they did something to upset you.

354
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,710
I thought that you'd be...

355
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,910
well aware of the situation
you're in at least.

356
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,779
Do you really think you have
time to waste like this?

357
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,079
With a girl who approached you
because of your background?

358
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,450
Please don't talk about her
that way.

359
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,059
It's In Ha, isn't it?

360
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,130
It looks like you need to know
who is the one that actually...

361
00:25:58,329 --> 00:25:59,730
approached me because of
my background.

362
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,140
How dare you talk to me like that?

363
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,039
Seeing you now...

364
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,039
made me realise
whom I should believe.

365
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,950
It's done.

366
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,849
Break up with her.

367
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,349
As soon as you become
a full-time employee,

368
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,650
I'm sending you to
our branch in Europe.

369
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,119
- Father.
- The whole company knows.

370
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,789
Everyone's talking about
how you rigged the interviews.

371
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,000
I think it's best that
you leave Korea for a while.

372
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,660
This event...

373
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,700
will be your first and last
official event in Korea.

374
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,569
Right. I told In Ha to attend
as well.

375
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
So watch yourself.

376
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,140
Don't disappoint me any further.

377
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:51,920
Get out.

378
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,029
Look over here, please.

379
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,539
Thank you.

380
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,539
What happened?

381
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,539
I was nice to her.

382
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,710
But she kept bothering me
and broke my toy.

383
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,980
So that's why you pushed her?

384
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,190
Didn't I tell you that it's bad
to express your anger?

385
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,549
Honey, stop it.

386
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,990
You stay out of this.

387
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,589
Jung. People are looking at us.

388
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,059
What should you do?

389
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,940
Yes. You should smile.

390
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,910
Will you be nice to her from now on?

391
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,750
I'm sorry for pushing you.

392
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,089
I'll forgive you
if you play with me.

393
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,130
And hold my hand.

394
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:15,099
Okay. I'll do what you want.

395
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,440
Let's play over there.

396
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,339
Okay. Let's sit down.

397
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,680
What's your bear called?

398
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,809
Teddy.

399
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,349
It's my favourite bear.

400
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,009
What are you doing here?

401
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,680
Are you playing with a girl?

402
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,380
Give me that.

403
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,920
No.

404
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,950
Gosh. I have to get another cup.

405
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,920
Do you want some juice?

406
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Yes.

407
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,130
It tastes strange.

408
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:48,099
It's okay. That's normal.
Drink the whole thing.

409
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,940
Did you say you wanted it?

410
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,440
I'll give you an arm.

411
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,089
Now that I think about it,

412
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,759
I don't want it any more.

413
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,730
Your son acts...

414
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,230
just like you did at his age.

415
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,500
Don't most children his age
act like that?

416
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,339
Before I met you,

417
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,440
I wasn't able to control my anger.

418
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,710
But Jung has never gotten angry.

419
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,450
That could be even more dangerous.

420
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:39,549
Sorry?

421
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,220
I noticed that he shows his anger
in his own way.

422
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,819
If that continues,

423
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,230
he may never be able to maintain
a normal relationship with anyone.

424
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,130
Then what should I do?

425
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,130
It would be nice
if he had siblings...

426
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,240
he could be around.

427
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,180
Oh, hello.

428
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,319
To what do I owe this call?

429
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,549
What did you do?

430
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,920
I let you off once.

431
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,359
I know.

432
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,160
Didn't that mean I could continue?

433
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,930
That's how I took it.

434
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:27,930
You...

435
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,069
crossed the line.

436
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,339
That was the last straw.

437
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,710
Jung.

438
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,109
There's something you don't know.

439
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,079
I lost my patience a long time ago.

440
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,049
I told you to watch out.

441
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,950
Bye. See you at the party.

442
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,130
Hello, Mr. Choi.

443
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,569
I'd like to add
a few more names to the list.

444
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,240
Yes, they're with me.

445
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,740
I'll email you the names,
so please add them.

446
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,549
Thank you.

447
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,059
Joon, where's my dictionary?

448
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,339
What are you doing?

449
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,339
I don't know.

450
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,339
What should I do?

451
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,950
You're smart.

452
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,150
You tell me.

453
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:54,950
Hit the books.

454
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,630
Do you...

455
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,000
really want to study...

456
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,430
Business Administration?

457
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,170
See? What will you do
after you graduate?

458
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,440
Figure that out first.

459
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,609
Do what you want to do.

460
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,450
You used to be talented and
good at a lot of things.

461
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,250
You used to have many dreams.

462
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,150
You aren't like me.

463
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,059
You can't let Dad control you.

464
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,630
Think about what
you really want to do.

465
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Where are you?

466
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,839
Dad told me to ask
if you're looking at colleges.

467
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,849
Hey, Kumquat.

468
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,319
Hi, Joon.

469
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:02,849
- Hello.
- Why are you here?

470
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,460
Hey, did you make this?

471
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,460
No. I'm helping the seniors.

472
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Is he your boyfriend?

473
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,630
No way.

474
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes way.

475
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,799
We're dating.

476
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,329
It's about time.

477
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,339
What? We really aren't dating.

478
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,599
What are you studying?

479
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,440
Excuse us for a moment.

480
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,910
I'm studying her.

481
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,549
Don't be silly.

482
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:31,809
Why are you here?

483
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,250
They're all guys.

484
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,980
Hang out with the girls.

485
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,049
We're entering a competition
as a team.

486
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,819
A competition?

487
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,259
Yes. My professor liked
what I made last time,

488
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,730
so he got me into their team.

489
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,200
It's a huge honour
to be able to work with them.

490
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,599
Good for you.

491
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,900
You must be busy then.

492
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,509
Of course. You saw us.

493
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:58,069
I can't think about anything else.

494
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,339
What have you been up to?

495
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,150
I've been really busy.

496
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,880
Oh, have you been getting drunk?

497
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,180
No.

498
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,449
Why are you really here?

499
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,949
I'm here to see my sister.

500
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,260
What for?

501
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,659
Stop asking questions.

502
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,230
See you.

503
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,929
Hey, don't drink too much.

504
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,239
A movie?

505
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,239
What's taking her so long?

506
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,750
Hello.

507
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,250
It's mine.

508
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,150
Hey, aren't you getting in?

509
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,219
How could I ride that?

510
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,329
Get in. Everyone drives
these nowadays.

511
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,730
- Do you know where I'm going?
- Get in.

512
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,099
You midget...

513
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,329
- Come on.
- Hey!

514
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,800
Get in. This car is actually
quite popular.

515
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,139
Oh, goodness.

516
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,809
- Careful.
- Why...

517
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:05,039
Okay.

518
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,679
I thought he was rich.
I guess I was fooled.

519
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,949
- What?
- Nothing.

520
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,019
How do you know Jung so well?

521
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,659
We grew up together,
like a family.

522
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,829
Mr. Yu treats me like
I'm his own daughter.

523
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:28,329
- Why do you ask?
- No reason.

524
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,230
I'm worried about you.

525
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,539
If Jung complains about
what happened,

526
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,710
tell me and I'll teach him...

527
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,840
You're pretty cute.

528
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,139
- Let go.
- Don't worry.

529
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:45,619
We're going through a rough patch,
but it won't last long.

530
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,349
I'm sure he knows by now that...

531
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,250
he can't control me
the way he does others.

532
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,929
How do I look?
Do I look nice?

533
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,829
What? You look beautiful.

534
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,130
Where are you going?

535
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,829
I'm going to a party where a lot
of important people will be at.

536
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,639
I have to look the part.

537
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,739
I've been bored these days,
so this is awesome.

538
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,840
You haven't been to
a party like that, right?

539
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,079
No.

540
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,849
We're here. Pull over.

541
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,349
Pull over a bit far away.
I don't want to be embarrassed.

542
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,550
- Right here?
- Yes.

543
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,360
Thanks anyway. I'll tell you
all about it afterwards.

544
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:30,829
Well, but...

545
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,340
(Artist Choi Ji Soo,
Solo Exhibition)

546
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,969
Should I have asked her to
check out this exhibition with me?

547
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,349
This is my style.

548
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,320
Gosh, I can finally breathe.

549
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,559
Jung.

550
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,559
You made it.

551
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:07,429
Thanks.

552
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,829
Cheers.

553
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:18,440
This is the type of place
that suits you and me.

554
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,739
We need to be at a fancy
and upscale place like this.

555
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,349
This is delicious.

556
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,449
By the way, I'm surprised.

557
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:31,090
I didn't think you'd come today.

558
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,860
You hate occasions like this.

559
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,429
Oh, no.

560
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,829
Mr. Yu must've scolded you
because of what had happened.

561
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,730
Don't worry.

562
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:43,199
I can talk to him and
make him forgive you.

563
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,829
Let's just have fun today, okay?

564
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,239
Okay.

565
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,070
I think I can do that today.

566
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,340
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

567
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,349
Baek In Ha?

568
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,349
How did you get in?

569
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,349
Not anyone can get in here.

570
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,360
"Anyone"?
That's what I want to say.

571
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,190
Your father owns a small company.
How did you even get the invitation?

572
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,530
Hey, by the way,

573
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,829
who's your current target?
What does he do?

574
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,840
He's someone you can never
be compared to,

575
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,239
so just mind your business.

576
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,610
Wait, excuse me.

577
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,610
You...

578
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:28,539
Hey, do you know her, too?

579
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,550
I toyed with her for a short while.

580
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:34,349
I was nice to her because of her
pretty face. Then she got obnoxious.

581
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:36,050
Hey, Baek In Ha.

582
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,750
- How many guys did you mooch off?
- Hey, hey.

583
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:39,989
Stop it. Calm down.

584
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,429
Don't get angry over
a girl like her.

585
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,329
I can't believe I let that witch...
Gosh, I'm beyond embarrassed.

586
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,199
Hey. What did you just say?

587
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,440
Did you call me a gold digger?

588
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:59,340
Didn't you buy me gifts
and beg me to date you?

589
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,110
Where do you think you're going?

590
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,110
- Apologise immediately.
- Get lost.

591
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,650
He should be apologising to me.

592
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:06,449
- You little...
- Let go!

593
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,119
- Apologise!
- She's unbelievable.

594
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,550
- Let go! Let go of me.
- Hey.

595
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,449
- Let go!
- Gosh, seriously.

596
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,260
How dare you little...

597
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:20,929
I don't want the guests
to be disturbed.

598
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:22,630
- Drag them out of here, okay?
- Who do you think you are?

599
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,969
Do you think you can get away
with treating me like this?

600
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,840
Do you know who I am?

601
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,739
I'm the daughter of Mr. Yu,
the chairman of Taerang Group.

602
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,639
You guys are the ones
who should know your place!

603
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,039
- Okay?
- You can't raise your voice here.

604
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,250
Please come with us.

605
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,179
Mr. Yu...

606
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,750
- Please come with us.
- Mr. Yu.

607
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:44,650
- Come with us.
- Let go of me.

608
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,460
- Please come with us.
- Mr. Yu.

609
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,360
Mr. Yu!

610
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:50,829
- Let go!
- You need to come with us.

611
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:53,130
Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu!

612
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:55,530
Come with us.

613
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,170
Jung.

614
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,940
- You need to leave.
- I was surprised to hear from you.

615
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,340
- Let go!
- Thanks for inviting me.

616
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:02,969
Right, you know Jun Soo, right?

617
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,039
Hey, Jung also invited me.

618
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,239
Is that right?

619
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,079
Have a seat.

620
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,119
We haven't talked in a while.

621
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,650
- Have you guys been doing well?
- Of course.

622
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:18,849
Right, I heard that you recently...

623
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,530
What's this now?

624
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,000
Baek In Ha!

625
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:30,000
What's this mess?

626
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,170
Jung, that jerk.
I'm going to kill him.

627
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,170
How dare he...

628
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,239
What's wrong with you?

629
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,750
Hey, Baek In Ha. In Ha!

630
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:47,980
What is wrong with you?

631
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:49,750
Hey, get up.

632
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,920
In Ha. Why are you acting like this?

633
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,960
Look at me. Look at me now.

634
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,530
What happened?

635
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,230
Why are you like this?
Tell me.

636
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,170
Tell me now!

637
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,239
Jung!

638
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,349
It's really late.

639
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,849
Why did you come all the way here?

640
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,980
I wanted to take you home.

641
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,659
Did you go somewhere today?

642
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,730
You look totally dashing.

643
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,829
I think I smell alcohol, too.

644
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:38,230
I had to attend an event for work.

645
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,440
I didn't drink that much though.

646
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,239
You didn't drive, did you?

647
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,840
I called a relief driver.

648
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,340
Let's go.

649
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,980
But I live really far.

650
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,079
That's even better.

651
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,650
I guess you're right.

652
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,250
What time do you finish
your exam tomorrow?

653
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,219
In the morning.

654
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,190
After this, I'll be done.

655
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,630
This semester feels
exceptionally long.

656
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,199
You did a good job this year, too.

657
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You, too.

658
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,440
By the way, are we really
going away tomorrow?

659
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,440
Have you spoken to your parents?

660
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,340
Yes.

661
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,739
I said that I'll be staying over
at Bo Ra's.

662
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,980
What would we have done
without Bo Ra?

663
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,309
You're right.

664
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:44,170
So are you saying that Jung...

665
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:47,639
plotted behind your back again?

666
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,440
But Mr. Yu...

667
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,239
didn't even say a word to me.

668
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,610
I was literally being
dragged out of the party.

669
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,349
He acted as if he didn't know me
at all.

670
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,460
Tell me that didn't happen.
This is a dream, right?

671
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,960
That's just impossible.
Mr. Yu loves me. Aren't I right?

672
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,630
Do you still not know?

673
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,530
To them, we're just...

674
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,070
pets.

675
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,969
He used us so that his son with
issues could grow up normally.

676
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:24,969
No, no.

677
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:29,039
- I'm going to go to Mr. Yu.
- In Ha.

678
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,980
I'm going to tell him
that Jung planned all this.

679
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,849
- In Ha.
- If I tell him how...

680
00:43:33,949 --> 00:43:35,650
wrongly accused I feel,
he will hug me and say sorry.

681
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:36,849
In Ha!

682
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,559
Come to your senses, please.
Okay?

683
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:44,090
Look at me.
I'm begging you.

684
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:48,599
What am I going to do
if you're falling apart like this?

685
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,530
Baek In Ha.

686
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:53,199
You should...
You should get some rest.

687
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,940
Go to your room and lie down.

688
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:56,610
Get up now.

689
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,340
He's not answering.

690
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,250
After making a fool of
my sister like that.

691
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,849
This jerk infuriates me so much.

692
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:17,190
Get out.

693
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:20,630
Get out of the car, you jerk.

694
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:23,929
Open this now.

695
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,099
Let's talk.

696
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,239
Get out of the car now.

697
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,610
Get out!

698
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,849
Tell me.

699
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,480
Why are you doing this to us?

700
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,650
Is it because I like Mad Hair?

701
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Is that why you had to
make a fool of In Ha?

702
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,130
Okay, I'll quit.

703
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,500
I'll do as you wish and get lost.

704
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,639
So please...

705
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,469
leave us alone.

706
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,780
Can you two...

707
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,380
just leave me alone?

708
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,320
- What?
- Ever since you moved in...

709
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:17,849
You've done enough.

710
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:20,389
You needed to impress my father.

711
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,420
I get that.

712
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,760
I don't care if you...

713
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,960
made me look bad on purpose.

714
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,070
It's in the past.

715
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,130
What are you talking about?

716
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,400
I didn't want to go that far.

717
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,510
But if I didn't, In Ha...

718
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,940
would have never given up.

719
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,380
Tell her this.

720
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,349
If she ever talks nonsense
about Seol again,

721
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,320
I might go off the deep end.

722
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,110
What did you do?

723
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:26,489
Gosh.

724
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,150
No.

725
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,019
I won't give up this easily.

726
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:38,130
After all I did to keep it...

727
00:47:48,269 --> 00:47:49,940
You must've been very upset
yesterday.

728
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:54,510
I'd dealt with those kids before
because they gave Jung a hard time.

729
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,550
They took it out on me.

730
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:58,949
You know...

731
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:02,719
how I used to take care of
the kids who bothered Jung.

732
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,519
In Ha. Let's end it here.

733
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,260
I'm telling the truth.
You have to believe me.

734
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:10,760
Those young men...

735
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,300
didn't seem to have
a problem with Jung.

736
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,570
You were the one
they had issues with.

737
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,099
I already knew what you were
up to,

738
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,610
but I wasn't expecting this.

739
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,139
Everyone there knew each other.

740
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,110
Did you not think
that would become an issue?

741
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,619
Did Jung say that?

742
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,320
I didn't have that kind of
relationship with them.

743
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:44,730
Don't believe what he says.
You know that he's a bit weird.

744
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,000
Weird?

745
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,699
Is that what you thought of him?

746
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,769
Is that what you tell everyone?

747
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,510
Mr. Yu...

748
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:00,710
I shouldn't have welcomed you.

749
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,010
What do you mean?

750
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,619
You said you wanted us to be family.

751
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,480
- You let me call you "Father".
- That was when...

752
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,690
I thought you could help Jung.

753
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:13,389
Now, you're just hurting him!

754
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,730
Do you expect me to abandon him...

755
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,989
to coddle you two?

756
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,429
Mr. Yu...

757
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:25,300
I don't hate you.

758
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:29,469
You are Doctor Baek's grandchildren,
and we've known each other...

759
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,670
for many years.

760
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:33,110
Let's...

761
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,710
cut our ties.

762
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:40,820
What do you mean by that?

763
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,420
Let's cut contact.

764
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,090
Mr. Yu.

765
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,329
No. I don't want to.

766
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,429
From now on,

767
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,159
please don't...

768
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,369
call or visit me.

769
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,369
That goes for...

770
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,500
Jung as well.

771
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,599
I'll kill you, Jung.

772
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:38,710
The exams are over!

773
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,739
You're leaving for your trip today.

774
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,110
Do you have what any girl needs...

775
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,420
when going on a trip
with her boyfriend?

776
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:50,989
- What?
- Do you?

777
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,219
What do you mean?

778
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,690
- Let's see. I'll have a look.
- Hey, what are you doing?

779
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,389
What should I have?

780
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,230
A book, laptop and dictionary.

781
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,000
What?
Those are a must.

782
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,699
When you think
things are getting a bit weird,

783
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,909
open up your textbook.

784
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,909
You look scary when you study.

785
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,139
You little! You're so mean.

786
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,010
I'm going.

787
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,710
Have fun.

788
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:18,909
Buy me something.

789
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,150
Stay safe.

790
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,119
Bo Ra. Do you want to
check out my laptop?

791
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,360
I have books, too.

792
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,599
Jung! Come out.

793
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,110
Yu Jung!

794
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,369
Come out. Yu Jung!

795
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,409
Open up.

796
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,079
I know you're in there!

797
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,480
Come out. Jung.

798
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,619
Come on.

799
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,489
I know you're in there!

800
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,369
Mr. Choi, could you come over
to my place?

801
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,769
Jung! Come out right now.

802
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:28,050
In Ha. How low will you go...

803
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,420
You jerk.

804
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,820
How low will I go?

805
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,090
How low can I go?

806
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:37,730
I've hit rock bottom!

807
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,159
- So what?
- So I'm blinded with rage!

808
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,860
Let go! Let go of me!

809
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,969
Jung.

810
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:51,969
You know why I'm doing this.

811
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,710
You should know.

812
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,980
You know how I feel...

813
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,610
That ship has sailed.

814
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,519
Not for me.

815
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,119
You're doing this...

816
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,119
because of...

817
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,219
that witch, Seol.

818
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:11,730
Do you think she'll be
any different?

819
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,400
She doesn't know you well yet.

820
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:17,269
I'm the only one who knows
the truth about you...

821
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:18,500
- and still understands you!
- So?

822
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,000
Must I love you then?

823
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,139
- What?
- In Ha.

824
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,110
Let's never meet again.

825
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,510
That's best for the both of us.

826
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,309
No. I can't do that.

827
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,340
After all those years I spent
being your puppet,

828
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:04,380
what did you say?

829
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:07,420
Did you leave me for
someone like her?

830
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:11,849
I accepted the twisted you,

831
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:14,119
and I cleaned up your mess!

832
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:15,590
You can't abandon me.

833
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,030
I won't let you do that to me!

834
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,260
You scumbag.

835
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,269
You of all people
can't do this to me!

836
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,000
- How dare you?
- Stop it.

837
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:30,139
- I can fight back, too, you know.
- Get out of here.

838
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,510
- Get her out!
- How could you?

839
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,909
- You of all people can't do this.
- Let's get her out of here.

840
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,610
How could you?

841
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,349
Let go!

842
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,250
Jung. Let go of me!

843
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,820
Let me go!

844
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:46,019
Go home.

845
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,159
- Let me in.
- Just stop it already!

846
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,000
Let me in!

847
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,170
Hey! Open the door!

848
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,210
Let me back in!

849
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,010
No!

850
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:13,619
How am I going to live?

851
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,190
Open this!

852
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,820
Open the door!

853
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:34,900
I spoke to her,
so I'm sure she'll understand.

854
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,010
I'll clean this place up
as soon as possible.

855
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:39,969
It's okay.

856
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,710
You can leave it for today.

857
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:44,179
- Just call someone tomorrow.
- Okay.

858
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:45,809
Well, then. You should rest.

859
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,099
Don't be surprised.

860
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,429
I'm on my way to your place now.

861
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
That's right.

862
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:09,500
I can't be the only one
who loses everything.

863
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,969
Yu Jung.

864
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,880
It's only fair that you lose
everything, too.

865
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:18,409
Don't you think so?

866
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
Die.

867
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:24,789
It's all your fault!

868
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,289
If you didn't exist...

869
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,619
I wouldn't have had to end up
like this!

870
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,789
None of this mess would've happened
if you didn't exist!

871
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,630
It's all because of you!
Let go!

872
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,260
Let go!

873
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,780
A person got hit by a car!

874
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,380
Gosh, is she going to be okay?

875
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,980
Goodness, someone
call the ambulance, please!

876
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,159
Don't be surprised.

877
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,269
I'm on my way to your place now.

878
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,409
Seol. Seol!

879
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,409
If something happens to Seol,

880
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,239
I won't forgive you.
I'll kill you.

881
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,880
You should've just left
when I first asked you to.

882
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:58,610
How can you even ask to see Seol?

883
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:01,079
- I'll take responsibility for this.
- How will you do that?

884
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:04,619
Why did I hold Jung's hand
at that moment?

885
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,190
Why did I not know sooner?

886
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:07,989
After this happened to you,
I finally...

887
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:10,190
It's your fault for dating
someone like her to begin with.

888
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,989
She wouldn't have had to go
through this if she didn't date you.

889
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,329
Bring In Ha back now.

890
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:15,900
Where is In Ha?
Where is she now?

891
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,800
He asked me for help
because of Jung.

892
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,000
How dare he lock me up here?

893
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:20,699
Have you been
telling Mr. Yu everything?

894
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:21,869
Am I the only one who did that?

895
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,269
You did the same, too.

896
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,710
I wish I had given it to you sooner.

897
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,980
How long will you be able to be
patient with me?

898
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,710
You can't carry
all the burden, Seol.
