1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,809
(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,779
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,779
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,760
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,760
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,160
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,399
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,070
(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

9
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,810
(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,460
I already drank a lot of coffee.

11
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,909
Jung.

12
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,609
(Episode 10)

13
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,079
I suddenly need a lot of carbs.

14
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,890
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

15
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,459
- I'll pass.
- Let's eat.

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,590
I don't have much of an appetite.
See you later.

17
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,390
Hey.
Come back.

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,870
Eun Taek doesn't have an appetite?
Is that possible?

19
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,569
I don't know.

20
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,710
He'd never say no to food.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,580
Slow down.
Take a few sips.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,479
You can talk now.

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,620
Okay.

24
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,949
I think Seol has been going through a lot.

25
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,759
I won't be around much
after the midterm exams.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,659
I was hoping...

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,759
you could tell me
if something happens to her.

28
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,669
Seol doesn't tell me about these things.

29
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,469
I was actually wondering whether or not...

30
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,580
I should show this to you.

31
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,949
Look at this.

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,580
Will you hear me out?

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,479
- Just listen.
- Let go of me.

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,419
You should be honoured
that I like you at all.

35
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,060
- Come here, Seol.
- Let go!

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,229
- Help!
- Come here.

37
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,460
You pervert.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,259
Hey, don't you...

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,669
I'm sure you heard just how weird
Yeong Gon was last year.

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,069
He's worse this year.
He's throwing himself at her.

41
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,840
I see.
What does Seol plan to do with these videos?

42
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:26,639
She'll take these to the police.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,780
I doubt it'll help, though.

44
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,979
I should've dealt with him last year
when I had the chance.

45
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,479
Eun Taek.

46
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:35,819
Can you send me everything you get
on Yeong Gon?

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,560
Like these clips.

48
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,490
Sure.
What will you do with them?

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,569
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.

50
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,370
- Do that for me.
- Sure.

51
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,270
Thanks for the burger.

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,340
- See you.
- Take care.

53
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,580
What on earth is this?

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,060
I'll see if she accuses me of...
copying her again.

55
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,230
She's the one copying me.
Why would I copy her?

56
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,839
She won't even let me apologise.

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,769
It's so embarrassing.
She should act her age.

58
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,980
It's you, Min Soo.

59
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,680
I thought you were Seol.

60
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,149
That's a cute doll.

61
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,120
- Is it a couple thing?
- What?

62
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,990
The kids say you have a boyfriend.

63
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh.
I do.

64
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,560
Min Soo.

65
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,509
You can try all you want,
but you'll never look the same.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,209
Don't you know that already?

67
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,779
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,019
You can't be stupid enough
to not understand.

69
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,459
Was that actually Jung?

70
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,769
I got the files you sent.

71
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,800
I liked the Terry Fox idea.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,240
I got the idea from the website
you sent me.

73
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,740
I see. Keep up the good work
and finish up the presentation.

74
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,649
Could it be that he knew?

75
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,579
Did he give me Seol's on purpose?

76
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
What for?

77
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,060
Hong Seol...

78
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,259
She put him up to it.

79
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,199
She wants to embarrass me.

80
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,500
She's being a coward, hiding behind her man.

81
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,769
Jung.

82
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,670
I was so impressed
by your last presentation.

83
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,379
- Thank you.
- That's why I think...

84
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,480
you should do this.

85
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,120
A proposal for the internal competition?

86
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,350
Must I do this on top of my duties?

87
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,959
I want to see how well you can do.

88
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,290
I have the main concept worked out,

89
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,490
so expand this to about 30 pages.

90
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:33,459
I'm giving you a chance to shine.

91
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,470
See what you can do.
Good luck.

92
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,279
I've started on trying
to get rid of the loser.

93
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,889
Watch and see what happens.

94
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,930
Isn't tomorrow your last exam?

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,829
Buy me lunch.
I'll be around campus.

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,230
- Min Soo.
- Yes?

97
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:10,399
What's the time?

98
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,839
It's 9:58.

99
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,949
My body figure is way better than her.
She also has tiny eyes.

100
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,550
- What's going on?
- Hey.

101
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,360
Why did you get your hair done?
Who are you trying to impress?

102
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,629
Why are they together?

103
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,560
Why do you come by so often?

104
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:40,129
I'm meeting Jung for lunch.

105
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,470
- You are?
- Didn't you know?

106
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,040
With Ah Young...

107
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,269
I have to study for an exam.

108
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,779
Come with us.

109
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,279
No.

110
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,579
Seol.

111
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,879
I bought you something,
in case you skipped breakfast.

112
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,779
You're the only person
who cares for me at all.

113
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,889
Hey, care for me half
as much as you care for her.

114
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,459
You aren't half as good as her.

115
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,490
- She's right.
- Grow up.

116
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,259
Here.
How is that?

117
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,970
What's going on?

118
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,269
You're a hamster.

119
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,100
- Wipe your mouth.
- Stop it.

120
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,370
- It's everywhere.
- Don't.

121
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,870
Hong Seol.

122
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,879
She takes everything I want.

123
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,550
What did I do to her to deserve this?

124
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:41,259
The exam questions always
come from parts I skipped.

125
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,759
- What was that about?
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

126
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,470
What did she just do?

127
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,480
Is she mad?

128
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,850
She did that to upset you.

129
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,080
Say something to her right now.

130
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,389
I won't ruin my exam over her.

131
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,059
Let's take the exam first.

132
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,559
She's insane.

133
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,360
- Jung.
- Hey.

134
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,230
Let's sit in the front.

135
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,570
Okay.

136
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,970
Min Soo.

137
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,740
You get prettier each day.

138
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,580
She has a boyfriend.

139
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,149
- Is he handsome?
- He sure is.

140
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,250
- Stop it.
- What for?

141
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,379
You said you'd show me his photo.

142
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,990
- Let's see it.
- I don't have one now.

143
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,960
- Show us.
- Check your phone.

144
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,259
I don't have one.

145
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,259
Here it is.

146
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,629
- I found it.
- He's cute.

147
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,230
- He's cute.
- Look.

148
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,200
- Good for you.
- Not bad.

149
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:55,669
- They make a nice couple.
- He looks cute.

150
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,600
Someone seems to be having a good time.

151
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,240
Someone must be looking out for her.

152
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,879
We have to get the truth
out of her later on.

153
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,379
- Let's focus on the exam first.
- Hey.

154
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,679
Do you have time to waste?

155
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,120
What now?

156
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,090
If he knows Seol...

157
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,559
No.
Even if he does know her,

158
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,559
he wouldn't come here.

159
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,470
They only saw one photo.
They won't remember his face.

160
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,669
You have 10 minutes left.

161
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,370
Oh no.
I'm doomed.

162
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,980
How did you answer the third question?

163
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,480
Yeong Gon.

164
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,980
I ruined my exam because of her.

165
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,789
The exam is finally over.

166
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:48,990
Min Soo.

167
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,220
What?

168
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,460
If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

169
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,960
You stole my lion, I get that.

170
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,799
Why did you step on it?

171
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,240
When will you get over that?
Do you think I'm out to get you?

172
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,580
Is everyone a thief if they have
what you once had?

173
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,980
- What a joke.
- Hey.

174
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,149
Why did you give the lion back?

175
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,850
I saw you step on it,
then you kicked it to Seol.

176
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,490
Can't I throw away what I got sick of?

177
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,620
What do you care?

178
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,820
Are you still upset about the lion?

179
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,629
Did Min Soo copy you?

180
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,399
Aren't you sick of arguing about that?

181
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,100
Do you really have nothing
to apologise about?

182
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,940
I don't.
I really don't.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,870
Why should I?

184
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,039
Jung, we're here.

185
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,279
Hi.

186
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,779
Seol.

187
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:55,750
Joon.
Why are you here?

188
00:11:55,789 --> 00:11:57,960
I said I'm meeting Jung for lunch.

189
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,230
Isn't he Min Soo's boyfriend?

190
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,129
- What?
- Right?

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,070
Did Jung use Joon to get to her?

192
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,740
Jung, is he Seol's brother?

193
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,269
Yes.
Why?

194
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,110
He's the boy from the photo
on Min Soo's phone.

195
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,009
Is Min Soo dating Seol's brother?

196
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,649
Joon, do you have a girlfriend?

197
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,389
What are you talking about?
I do not.

198
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,889
Who's Min Soo?

199
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,720
This is the girl I like.

200
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,259
Are you a cheater?

201
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,429
I am not.
I don't even know her.

202
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,159
It's a misunderstanding, I swear.

203
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,769
Min Soo.
Say something.

204
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,570
He just looks like...

205
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,779
Hey.

206
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,940
It's him.

207
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,379
It's me.

208
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
This is Joon.

209
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,350
I don't believe this.
You're just unbelievable.

210
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,019
Why did you take a photo of him?

211
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,830
Give it back! Why are you going through
someone else's phone?

212
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
Explain this situation.

213
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,600
You can't lie forever. What were you
going to do with this photo?

214
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,700
What were you thinking?

215
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,570
- I just...
- She faked it all.

216
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,809
Is everything a lie, then?

217
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,909
- Really?
- I get it now.

218
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,019
Min Soo, what's going on?

219
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,590
You knew about this.

220
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,659
You knew...

221
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,360
and set this up to shame me in public.

222
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,769
- You set me up!
- Hey.

223
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,470
- Hey, hey.
- Just to embarrass me!

224
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,570
- Stop it.
- Each time...

225
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,940
Don't film this.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,639
- When will you stop?
- What's wrong with her?

227
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,039
- Who's the one bothering whom?
- Let go of her.

228
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,240
Min Soo.

229
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,879
- You tortured me.
- Turn around.

230
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,379
It was you!

231
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,950
Who do you think you are?

232
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,190
What were you going to do with my brother?

233
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:12,120
- Go for it. Punch her, Seol.
- What were you planning?

234
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,629
Stop copying me.

235
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,129
Why are you trying to copy me?

236
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,269
The paper and the outfits.

237
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,700
Did you patent them?

238
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,269
Why are you torturing me over that?

239
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,539
Why are you always out to get me?

240
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,480
Have you forgotten what you've done?

241
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,210
You stole my doll.
Why do you want what's mine?

242
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,320
Why did you come after my brother?

243
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:43,850
You're the one who has to leave me alone.

244
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,830
You have everything...

245
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,460
that I want.

246
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,769
Good grades.

247
00:14:57,669 --> 00:14:58,940
Lots of friends.

248
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,570
You even have a boyfriend.

249
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,809
Why are you so upset about what I did?

250
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,350
You're really...

251
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,950
I don't know why you're saying all this.

252
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,059
But I have...

253
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,559
worked hard to get good grades...

254
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,570
and it wasn't easy to befriend people.

255
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,470
Okay?

256
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,480
Min Soo, you weren't like this before.

257
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,580
Why have you changed?

258
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,279
Before...

259
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:50,389
I was a nobody.

260
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,220
I've never seen you before.
Are you in our department?

261
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,559
Are you in Business Management?
What are you majoring in?

262
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,230
Seol.

263
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,600
Who are you?

264
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,269
Don't you know me?
I'm Min Soo.

265
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,039
No one knew my name or who I was.

266
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,750
I was a loser and no one cared about me.

267
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,879
I won't go back to those days.

268
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,049
Is that so?

269
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,759
Do you prefer this?

270
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,129
Everyone will now...

271
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,299
remember you as Min Soo the liar.

272
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,500
Would you like that?

273
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,460
Did you call Joon?

274
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,059
I'm glad that it's over now.

275
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,960
I know you were being very patient.

276
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,700
It's over.

277
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,769
I know it was hard on you.

278
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,769
People who feel inferior
and want what others have...

279
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,539
always end up that way.

280
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,650
They strive for more
and lose what they have.

281
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,579
Don't worry about it too much.

282
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,289
People only approached me
whenever they wanted something.

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,059
Jung...

284
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,569
must have put up with
such people his whole life.

285
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,670
And here I am, infuriated
because of just one person.

286
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:50,769
I won't rush it.

287
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,650
If you try to understand me
and come to me,

288
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,779
then I can wait.

289
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,390
As long as you come to me.

290
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,220
So you will just wait...

291
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,859
and I have to come to you?

292
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,460
Will that sort everything out?

293
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,200
At first...

294
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,940
I thought we were very much alike.

295
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,380
Now I realise that we are very different.

296
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,579
I'm trying as well.
I wonder why I frustrate you.

297
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,490
And why you're distant.

298
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,730
Again.

299
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,069
Gosh.

300
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,990
I don't get it.

301
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,759
What more can I do?

302
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,500
You're just moving your fingers.

303
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,569
You need to play it
from the bottom of your heart.

304
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,269
You didn't hurt your fingers.

305
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,869
You hurt this.

306
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,269
Your performances had sincerity back then.

307
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:39,079
You used to shine.

308
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,180
Look at you now.
This isn't you.

309
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,680
Professor Noh liked you
because you used to shine like a jewel.

310
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:49,549
Do you know how pleased he was
when he heard that you came back?

311
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,559
Did you tell him about me?

312
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,059
Without my permission?

313
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,460
Why did you go and do that?

314
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,670
Wouldn't he just love
to see you like this?

315
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,869
Hey.

316
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Hey.

317
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,869
Hey.

318
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,039
Didn't you hear me?

319
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,339
Are you looking for something?

320
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,579
No.

321
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,250
What's wrong?

322
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,980
Hang on.

323
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,589
What happened to your face?

324
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:31,589
Who did this?

325
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,960
Was it the stalker?

326
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,730
No.

327
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,299
Then who was it?
In Ha?

328
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,000
No.

329
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,930
Then who did this?

330
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,279
Are you going home like that?

331
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Your mum would be so pleased.

332
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,220
Come here.

333
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,420
- What for?
- Come with me.

334
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,390
Put this on.

335
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,539
Not there.

336
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,039
You got the wrong spot.
Give me that.

337
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,779
What a mess.

338
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,549
Be still.

339
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,089
There.

340
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,799
You're quite a fighter.
I'm proud of you.

341
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,769
Did you win?

342
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,509
What's there to win?

343
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,839
If you're going to fight,
you might as well win.

344
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,480
It's complicated.

345
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,150
I thought about why she did what she did.

346
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,490
Maybe she envied me the way I envied Joon.

347
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,400
You envy someone for no reason,

348
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,529
so you copy that person.

349
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:25,470
But you can never be that person,
so it eats you up inside.

350
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,970
I was only angry at her.

351
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,079
I never tried to understand her.

352
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,980
If I'd befriended her
when she first came up to me,

353
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,750
then maybe
it wouldn't have gotten this far.

354
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,920
The odd thing is that...

355
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,690
I finally think I understand her.

356
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,400
Jung told me
that I should forget about it.

357
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,910
Did you reconcile?

358
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,710
No.
I didn't, but...

359
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,619
I think...

360
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,190
I understand him a bit more, too.

361
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,160
I realised that...

362
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:23,059
I only listened to
what I wanted him to say...

363
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,230
and saw what I wanted to see.

364
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,569
I saw him the way I wanted him to see me.

365
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,880
I didn't get a word of that.

366
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,349
Let's go.

367
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,319
You better think up of an excuse
to tell your parents.

368
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,769
Min Soo stopped coming to her classes.

369
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,470
Everyone thinks
she took a leave of absence.

370
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,670
No one seemed to care about it and I...

371
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:14,279
- Here comes the street fighter.
- Good luck.

372
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,750
I became a star for many reasons.

373
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,849
Did you see that glare?
I'm afraid to look at her.

374
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,519
Did you see the way she walks?

375
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,960
But the attention didn't last.

376
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,529
The incident between Min Soo
and I slowly became gossip,

377
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,470
and campus life returned back to normal.

378
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,670
You all look so excited.

379
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,740
I love instant noodles.

380
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,509
Where should I put it?

381
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,410
Red Seol?

382
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,819
What's this?
What is this?

383
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,519
Hong Seol?
Hong Seol?

384
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,990
Jung's girlfriend?

385
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,930
How does In Ha know her?

386
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm sure no one else has that name.

387
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:11,069
How close must they be
for him to have this?

388
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,069
In Ha!

389
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,009
This is going to get exciting.

390
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:30,420
How are you doing?

391
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,359
Is everything okay?

392
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,559
What do I want to do?

393
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,660
You can play this?

394
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:18,970
This was my ringtone at school.

395
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,769
I was bored, that's all.

396
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,680
- Why don't you go on?
- I don't feel like it.

397
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:31,180
That sounded so different.

398
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,650
The whole thing...

399
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,519
sounds so sad.

400
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:39,660
Sad?

401
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:41,589
Yes.

402
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,690
And a bit mournful.

403
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,299
I guess it depends on who's playing.

404
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,289
La, mi, la.

405
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,289
Do, si, la.

406
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,730
Not bad.

407
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:28,170
- Should I go to school?
- What?

408
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,079
- You are going to school.
- Right.

409
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,750
I mean not to learn piano,

410
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,079
but as a real student.

411
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,789
I could do what you suggested.
Get my GED.

412
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,559
Do you mean that?

413
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,160
That would be great!

414
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,059
I'll help you.
You can use Joon's old books.

415
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,569
I'll teach you between classes
in our library.

416
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,130
I'll fix a schedule.

417
00:29:58,069 --> 00:30:00,500
We'll need some notebooks.

418
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
What?

419
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,180
What's wrong?

420
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:18,859
It's nothing.

421
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,789
Your face is...

422
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:23,890
What?

423
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,529
- Your face...
- What?

424
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,799
- Don't.
- Don't do what?

425
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,740
Are you sick?

426
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,809
- Your face is really...
- I'm not sick.

427
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,039
Your face is really red.

428
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,579
I'm coming down with a cold.

429
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:46,019
I have to go.
Play some more.

430
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,890
Is he sick?

431
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,559
You played the piano
even though you were sick?

432
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,230
Did you take some medicine?

433
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,500
I don't need to.
That's for weaklings.

434
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,339
I'll get over it.

435
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,109
You're such a show off.

436
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,190
Aren't you going home?
Why are you following me?

437
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,890
I'm not following you.

438
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,859
I'm going to the store to help close up.

439
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
Forget it.

440
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,730
You won't be much help anyway.
I'll do it. You go home.

441
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,069
You're the one with a flushed face
who won't be any help.

442
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,269
Someone might think you own the place.

443
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,240
What was that head-flick for?

444
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,339
It was cute.

445
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,940
Hello.

446
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,180
Mum?

447
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,390
- Where is she?
- Get out.

448
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,160
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

449
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,859
There you are.

450
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,960
Why weren't you at work?

451
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,630
Why are you here?

452
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,170
Can't you see?
I'm here to eat.

453
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,769
You told me you work nearby,
but you won't let me visit.

454
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,170
I wanted to see what your secret was.

455
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,170
The noodles aren't bad.

456
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,779
You're done eating, so leave.

457
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,750
- I still have one mouthful left.
- Get out.

458
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,180
Hang on.
I saw you somewhere.

459
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,359
Is she your girlfriend from the cinema?

460
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,119
Please leave.

461
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,859
- Hong Seol.
- Oh.

462
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,059
What are you two doing here?

463
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,930
Are you alone, Mum?

464
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,470
Yes. Your dad said he was tired
and went home first.

465
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,269
And Joon disappeared.

466
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,480
Seol, I have to deliver this.
Can you clean up for me?

467
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,579
Sure.

468
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Thank you.

469
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,750
Wait.

470
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,019
Are you Hong Seol?

471
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,960
So you aren't his girlfriend.
You're Jung's girlfriend.

472
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,160
Are you?

473
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,059
Are you Jung's girlfriend?

474
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,369
Yes.
I am.

475
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm so sorry if I scared you last time.

476
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,480
I overreacted
because some loser kept calling me,

477
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,380
and I got really mad.

478
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,779
I was joking about the girlfriend thing.

479
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,920
I hope you didn't take it the wrong way.

480
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,619
Jung and I are just old friends,
so don't get the wrong idea.

481
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,859
What are you talking about?

482
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Stop grumbling and would you please leave?

483
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:47,059
We girls have a lot to talk about.

484
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,799
Don't even think about it.
Go home.

485
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,839
Fine, I'll leave.
I have a lot of questions for you, too.

486
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,970
It was great to meet you.
I'll see you again.

487
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,339
Stop talking nonsense.

488
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
Bye.

489
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,230
- Get inside.
- I will.

490
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
How did you find the place?

491
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,730
Why are you trying to be her friend
and what were you talking about?

492
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,769
You're the one who should be explaining.

493
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,269
Why are you with her?

494
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:31,710
First you made me think
this other girl was her,

495
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,480
and you even work for her parents?

496
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,250
That's none of your business.
Stay on topic.

497
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,980
What are you planning?

498
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,489
Did you get close to her to annoy Jung?

499
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,860
Yes.
I did.

500
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,860
That's it.
That's exactly it.

501
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,769
You have a long way to go.
You're so bad at lying.

502
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,440
I'm telling the truth.

503
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,769
Oh, is it now?

504
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,480
You can't even talk properly.

505
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,280
- Do you like her?
- No!

506
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,750
That's nonsense.

507
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:15,179
She's Jung's girlfriend.
You know what'll happen if you touch her.

508
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,889
She's not the one I have a problem with.

509
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:21,460
I'll get to her once I get back
what is rightfully mine.

510
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:23,829
What are you talking about now?

511
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,800
What do you like about her?
She wouldn't stand out in a crowd.

512
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,429
Are her parents rich?
Or is it because Jung's dating her?

513
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:33,440
I said it's not like that.

514
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,469
Okay, fine.

515
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,880
I should put Red Seol's book away.

516
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,079
Don't you dare touch that.

517
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,380
Gosh!

518
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,079
Good luck.

519
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,050
- Go into your room.
- Love isn't a game

520
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,889
It's not a game

521
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,190
It's about how you feel, In Ho.

522
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:02,670
These are all subjects for ninth grade.

523
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,570
There.

524
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,739
Which one should we study first?
I need to know how much you know.

525
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,570
- Pick a subject.
- Ninth grade?

526
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,079
I already graduated from middle school.

527
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,480
Then you will do just fine.

528
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,780
Korean language is most important,
so let's start with that.

529
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,750
Seriously?

530
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,449
Do you think I'm dumb?

531
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,170
- You have a bad cold.
- What did you think?

532
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,469
Can you manage?

533
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,269
You bet.
It's our first class together.

534
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,980
I will give you 60 minutes.

535
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:55,280
It's 2:20pm now, so you have until 3:20.

536
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,889
Get started.

537
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,360
Okay.

538
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:11,369
It's not beating.

539
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,800
Good.

540
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,710
I knew it.

541
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,570
I was just sick.

542
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,449
- What?
- What?

543
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,579
It's nothing.
I'll concentrate.

544
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,460
Which of the following does not
describe the narrator's attitude?

545
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,559
What's a narrator?

546
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,929
You know what it is.

547
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,070
Number three.

548
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,380
They're coming.

549
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,179
Why are we here?

550
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,650
We're here to study.
Why else?

551
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,090
Our exams are over.

552
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,260
- Let's go on a date.
- Are you getting it?

553
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,829
We can date in the library.

554
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:13,800
Since when did you study so hard?

555
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,869
I always studied harder than you.

556
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,539
- Text her.
- I already am.

557
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,880
Loser alert.

558
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,980
I have work to do.
Solve all the problems.

559
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,170
Seol.
We need to talk.

560
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,239
Shut it.
Don't disturb me while I'm working.

561
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,610
You're just unbelievable.
Forget Jung.

562
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,579
Is that guy your type?
You're cheating on him, right?

563
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,190
Are you both cheating?

564
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,860
You're just perfect for each other.

565
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,230
I can't believe this.

566
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,260
You treated me like dirt.

567
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,369
Who's the real dirt now?

568
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,969
You act like you're so virtuous,

569
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,769
but you make innocent people
like me look like fools.

570
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,239
Don't you love it that everyone
falls for it?

571
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,610
How dare you?
Are you ignoring me now?

572
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,949
Let's not cave in.

573
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,849
- Look at me.
- Get the evidence.

574
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,190
Who do you think you are?
You aren't better than me.

575
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,690
I said stop ignoring me.

576
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
Don't ignore me.
Do you hear me?

577
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,329
What's going on?

578
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,860
It's you.

579
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:56,869
Come here.

580
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,070
- In Ho!
- Help.

581
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,840
- He's trying to kill me.
- Come here.

582
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,809
Save me! Help!

583
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,579
He's after me!

584
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,679
- What's going on?
- In Ho!

585
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,179
Get lost.

586
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,550
In Ho!

587
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,349
- You deserve a beating.
- Don't hit him.

588
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,889
You can't hit him.

589
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,019
- You...
- Don't hit him.

590
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,860
That was close.

591
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,530
Why did you stop me?
He...

592
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,070
Why were you filming that?

593
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,969
What's it for?

594
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,380
Hey.
What's wrong with you?

595
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Da Young.

596
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,119
I saw what happened in the lobby.

597
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,719
Did you go to the library to see Seol?

598
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,289
No.

599
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,559
I love going on a date with you
in the library.

600
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,760
You're such a joke.

601
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,699
You know how much I like you.
Let's not fight.

602
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,170
Are you playing hard to get?

603
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,570
- You wish.
- Da Young.

604
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't know how I should put this,

605
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:13,280
but Seol still thinks I'm into her.

606
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,750
She thinks I'm stalking her
whenever we're in the same area.

607
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,750
Why didn't you tell me?

608
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,179
What's the point of making you worry?

609
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,320
I just went in there to find a book
and she blew up.

610
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,429
What's wrong with her?

611
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,360
Does she have a mental issue?

612
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,860
You know she has an inferiority complex.

613
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,969
Jung, have a look.

614
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,710
How dare you?
Are you ignoring me now?

615
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,809
Who do you think you are?

616
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:54,280
I said stop ignoring me.

617
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,650
Don't ignore me.
Do you hear me?

618
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,960
It's you.

619
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,460
Help.
He's trying to kill me.

620
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:10,530
Baek In Ho?

621
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,579
Do you need evidence?

622
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,079
I think you should get rid of him
by beating him.

623
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,280
We need to beat him up.
You're so frustrating.

624
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,590
Then he might really sue you.

625
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,860
I got kicked out of the institute
because you beat him up.

626
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,460
What?

627
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,730
Because of me?

628
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,070
Be careful.

629
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,380
What?
Why did you stand up?

630
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,289
It's cramped.

631
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,929
Go on reading.

632
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,860
How to Find a Job?

633
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:19,269
Why are you reading that?
Will reading that help?

634
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:21,969
- Yes.
- You try so hard.

635
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,840
- Don't you get tired?
- No.

636
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,480
Really?

637
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,650
You play the piano,
work and study for your GED.

638
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:36,090
You work even harder than I do.

639
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,260
This is just boring.
I blame you for changing me.

640
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,960
Yes, yes, I am so sorry.

641
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,869
Keep up the good work.

642
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,179
I don't want to catch a cold.

643
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,190
- Are you scared you'll get it?
- I look out for myself.

644
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,489
You should do the same.

645
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,860
Quit showing off and take the pills.

646
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,840
How are things at work?

647
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:29,969
It's fine.

648
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,710
How's everything going
with the marketing team?

649
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,010
There's a lot to do especially
with planning,

650
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,820
but I'll manage.
I'm learning a lot.

651
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,289
Do you get along with the others?

652
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:47,760
What?

653
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,460
I agreed to let you hide your identity,

654
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,360
but I'm worried.

655
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,269
How you act now will influence
what they will think of you later.

656
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:59,269
You must be careful.

657
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:03,309
A passing comment you made
could be misunderstood.

658
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,039
There are eyes everywhere.

659
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,780
Have you heard something?

660
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
Was there an incident
I should have heard of?

661
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,190
I wouldn't know...

662
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,760
what you heard or who you heard it from.

663
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,329
Why are you so sensitive today?

664
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,159
It's so strange.

665
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,900
I always thought I did

666
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,869
what you wanted me to do.

667
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:42,280
Why do you always treat me
like a delinquent child?

668
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,389
Do you think I'm that odd?

669
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,059
Are you worried?

670
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,829
What are you worried about?

671
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:06,170
I have work to finish by tomorrow.

672
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,869
Excuse me.

673
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,659
So you will just wait
and I have to come to you?

674
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,369
Answer the phone.

675
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,440
- You answer it.
- Can't you see that I'm busy?

676
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,550
- Gosh.
- Answer the phone.

677
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,980
- Seol, answer the phone.
- Okay.

678
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,690
Who could be calling at this time?

679
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:02,820
Hello?

680
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,159
Hello?

681
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,829
You're still up.
What were you doing?

682
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,570
Oh Yeong Gon?

683
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,170
Why did you call?

684
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:20,079
I know where you live.
And of course I have your number.

685
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:23,650
If you answered your cell phone,
I wouldn't be calling your house.

686
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,750
You gave me no choice.

687
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,380
Have you lost your mind?

688
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,860
Seol, I've been thinking.

689
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,929
I plan to forgive you
for what happened at the library.

690
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,659
I know you brought that jerk along
to upset me.

691
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,070
Is it about Da Young?

692
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:46,739
I told you I'm going to break up with her.

693
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,170
I'm not like Jung.
I'm not a player.

694
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,010
You lunatic.

695
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,340
Hello?

696
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,750
She still doesn't get it.

697
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,349
Why were you so rude?
Who was it?

698
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:08,159
Some lunatic was talking nonsense.

699
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:16,969
I want everyone to see.

700
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,539
There is this girl on campus...

701
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,969
that I am trying to get.

702
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,679
No.

703
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,179
If Seol is to leave Jung,

704
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,480
I need to show her proof
that he's cheating on her.

705
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:36,619
How am I going to get proof?

706
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,860
That's it! I know what to do.

707
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,630
All I have to do is get a photo of Jung
being with another girl.

708
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:54,969
I'm so smart.

709
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,639
Do you want to know more?

710
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,639
Then send me proof...

711
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,280
that you are Jung's girlfriend.

712
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,949
So he isn't so stupid after all.

713
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,059
What now? If I don't give him
what he wants, I can't continue.

714
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:22,429
We were close until last year.

715
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,869
What went wrong?

716
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:28,639
I have nice hair and a great outfit.

717
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,369
I also have good skin.

718
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,710
Will this do?

719
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,980
She actually sent it.

720
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,980
This is awesome.

721
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,449
I can't wait to show this to everyone.

722
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,250
It's over, Jung.

723
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,760
This is for you.

724
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,260
You should buy a lottery ticket.

725
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,230
This is my time.

726
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:58,329
I got this.

727
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,570
What's this?

728
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:03,809
This is for you.

729
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,539
Why did she send me this?

730
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,280
Look at her cleavage.

731
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,889
Even this works.

732
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:20,420
Will you play with me now?
Send me something in exchange.

733
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,260
Okay.

734
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,360
I should send her something sexy.

735
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,269
What's this?

736
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,670
Gosh, you're gutsy.

737
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:40,480
I feel so sad.
I'm lonely, you know.

738
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:42,280
It's worse because it's autumn.

739
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,610
My phone might get a virus.

740
00:50:46,349 --> 00:50:47,380
How about...

741
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,690
I comfort you?

742
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:51,989
Let's meet up.

743
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,260
Why?
Do you want to meet me?

744
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:02,860
It would be great if I could get her
to meet Seol in front of Jung.

745
00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:07,840
Of course.
The sooner, the better.

746
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:11,869
You moron. You'll be seeing me
sooner than you think.

747
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,739
Hey.

748
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,710
Okay, fine.

749
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,849
Can't you just give me your laptop?

750
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Is that Jae Woo?

751
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,349
Who would mess with Jae Woo?

752
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,489
I have class.
And I need my notes...

753
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:25,989
for this class.

754
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,360
Then leave your laptop with me.

755
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:31,429
Didn't you hear what I said?
I need it.

756
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,159
- Lend it to me.
- Hello.

757
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,429
You can't even afford a laptop?

758
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,170
What makes you think
that's worth telling everyone about?

759
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:42,969
I like Jae Woo because he's rich
and he buys me food.

760
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,070
- Who are you?
- You're not leaving?

761
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,579
Give us some room.

762
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:50,079
- Go.
- Get lost...

763
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,710
before I kill you.

764
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,980
I'm leaving.

765
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,079
- See you.
- Go!

766
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,750
I'm going.
What's her problem?

767
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,920
Who is that loser?

768
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,159
Don't hang out with people like him.

769
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,460
- Okay.
- Good.

770
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,860
Were you studying?

771
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,360
These are Kandinski's.

772
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:11,630
Do you know about him?

773
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:14,469
Do you know a lot about paintings?

774
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:17,670
I just happened to guess correctly.

775
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,480
Jae Woo has a girl, too?

776
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,980
Unbelievable.

777
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,150
Do Hyun, do you have a cigarette?

778
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:28,980
Stop smoking.
Your teeth is going to turn black.

779
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,820
And girls hate the smell of cigarettes.

780
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:33,050
Get lost.

781
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:36,659
My dear juniors.
Let's get some coffee.

782
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,559
- I'm busy.
- I have to be somewhere.

783
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:40,960
I'm sorry.

784
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:43,269
Do I have a disease?

785
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,329
Why is everyone avoiding me?

786
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:47,469
I'll call you Plumpy for now.

787
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,869
My dear Plumpy.

788
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:50,070
Yeong Gon.

789
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,539
Sang Cheol.

790
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,969
My dear junior.

791
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,840
My dear senior.

792
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,280
- Let's get coffee.
- Shall we?

793
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,480
- Yes.
- Let's.

794
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,079
- You're the best.
- I have your back.

795
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:05,820
I can't find a job
and nothing's working out.

796
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,260
Now even Jae Woo
doesn't take me seriously.

797
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,559
I see.

798
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,559
Yeong Gon, we live in such a weird world.

799
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,469
Some are born into rich families
and easily get paid internships.

800
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,369
We have no money or connections...

801
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,369
and have to slave away just to get by.

802
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,170
Think about those interviews.

803
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,440
If you aren't wearing an expensive suit,

804
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,079
you feel intimidated.

805
00:53:31,179 --> 00:53:33,480
The girls who are pretty enough...

806
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:37,550
flock to guys who are rich and handsome.

807
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:40,989
I can understand if it were anyone else,

808
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,219
but I can't lose to Jae Woo.

809
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,829
It's all about money.

810
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,969
There are no problems in this world
as long as you have money.

811
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:54,269
I wouldn't know.
I've always had enough money.

812
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,639
And I have more girls than I can handle.

813
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,480
I'm sorry,
but I can't really relate to you.

814
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,079
What?

815
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,179
Oh.
Sang Cheol.

816
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,619
Here's some advice.

817
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,889
Will you please wake up?

818
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:14,860
Stop blaming others.

819
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,860
That's why Jae Woo
doesn't take you seriously.

820
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,960
You deserve to be looked down on.

821
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,869
- What?
- And these coffees.

822
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:26,369
Buy your own.

823
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,070
Do you think I have money to waste?

824
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,869
Gosh!

825
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:35,880
Hello.

826
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:38,179
- Seol.
- Yes?

827
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,480
Read this.

828
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,380
Okay.

829
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,489
We got a lot of complaints.

830
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,719
This has never happened before.

831
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,960
I saw you and some guy scream
and throw books and run.

832
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,530
- I'm sorry.
- They fired you.

833
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,429
What?

834
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:07,179
Hey.
It's like she's in a haze.

835
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,710
Look at her eat.

836
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,079
When will Yeong Gon
stop getting you in trouble?

837
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,079
Should we hire an exorcist for you?

838
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:19,349
Don't worry too much.
You'll find another job soon.

839
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,659
It won't be that easy.

840
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,030
Most jobs will be taken already.

841
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:27,800
I guess.

842
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,730
Wouldn't it be best to get a job
that looks good on your resume?

843
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,170
You're so clueless, aren't you?

844
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:37,539
It's not that easy during the semester.

845
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,380
Are you carefree enough
to hit people with your spoon?

846
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,079
My dad said he'd open me a shop.

847
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:44,550
- What shop?
- Whatever I want.

848
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,480
Who do you think is the clueless one now?

849
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,780
Don't you have to go to the army?

850
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:51,590
Do you even have a dream?

851
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,059
I plan to
enter the fashion industry, so...

852
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,260
I'll start off with being a model.

853
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,059
What a show off.
Let's see if you even get that far.

854
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,730
When will you have faith in me?

855
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,639
- Never.
- Never.

856
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:11,639
That's not good.

857
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:15,280
I'll see
if I can find you some tutoring work.

858
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,579
Cheer up and eat up.

859
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,980
I will.
Thank you.

860
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:23,719
You, too.
Eat up.

861
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,289
I will.

862
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,659
The fishcake is good today.
Have some more.

863
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,829
You can take my sweet potato stems.

864
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,429
It's seaweed, you idiot.

865
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,469
Eat this, too.

866
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,570
It's all for the better.

867
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:46,070
I have more time to study.

868
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,079
I'm exhausted.

869
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,650
You need to see this.

870
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,360
Send.

871
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:09,559
You need to see this.

872
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:44,969
Hey.

873
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,269
You're here.
You're late.

874
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,070
Yes.

875
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,980
Where do we start?

876
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,289
Korean language?

877
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,960
How about English grammar?

878
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,159
Hey.

879
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,699
I'm sorry, but can we do this tomorrow?

880
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,369
No.
We have to follow the schedule.

881
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:25,969
Pick one.

882
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,380
Okay, then.

883
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,349
You didn't progress.

884
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:41,559
I'm feeling generous.

885
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Let's go.

886
00:58:56,769 --> 00:58:59,969
Jung wouldn't lie
about something like that.

887
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,480
I trust him.

888
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:07,780
I know it's a misunderstanding.

889
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,650
But that photo...

890
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,659
We're here already.

891
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,059
What's on your mind?

892
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,469
Why are you here?

893
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,840
Are you walking me home?

894
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,869
No.
I'm going home.

895
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,639
You can't be.

896
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,880
Your home is that way.

897
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,679
Whatever.
Take this.

898
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,550
What's that?

899
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,159
Pepper spray.

900
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,760
Aim for the eyes.

901
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,630
A taser.
Be careful with that.

902
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,469
A stick.
Shake it.

903
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:05,639
There.
It's for beating someone.

904
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,980
Use things like that
instead of throwing books.

905
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,389
Do you know who I'm talking about?
Your stalker.

906
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,460
What's this?

907
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,960
It's a torch and the red button...

908
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,960
- It makes that sound.
- Oh.

909
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,570
Thank you.

910
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:38,070
So...

911
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:42,510
why did you want to skip today's lesson?

912
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,650
What's bothering you?

913
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,809
- It's nothing.
- Not again.

914
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:51,889
I thought you
felt more comfortable with me.

915
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:54,559
You can tell me, you know.

916
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,989
Talking about it won't change anything,

917
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,059
and you're busy with your own issues.

918
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,800
Thanks for these, anyway.

919
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,800
Sure.

920
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:11,170
Open your eyes.

921
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,880
Good.

922
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:29,159
You can't rely on me.

923
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,260
But then...

924
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,760
even I couldn't rely on me.

925
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,539
I hope she's okay.

926
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,800
How could you do this to me, you jerk?

927
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:15,170
This lunatic is Jung's girlfriend.

928
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,969
You are never around because of work,

929
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:21,579
and In Ho's acting
like he's your girlfriend's assistant.

930
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,849
You looked sad and lonely last time.

931
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,610
- In Ho.
- Today...

932
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:27,880
- you're like sunshine.
- Mad Hair.

933
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,719
You two got quite close.

934
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,989
Why should I take a break for Joon?

935
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,960
I want to get complimented, too.

936
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:36,360
I want to be comforted, too.

937
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,059
Have you seen my sister?

938
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:39,929
She left home.

939
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,360
I missed you a lot.

940
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,869
I missed you, too.

941
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,340
Very much.
