(Cheese in the Trap)

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,710
You should've been more careful.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,619
Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,589
Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,929
- Mad Hair.
- Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,230
(Seo Kang Joon, Lee Sung Kyung)

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,730
- That's such a great idea.
- I know, right?

(Park Min Ji, Nam Joo Hyeok)

(Cheese in the Trap)

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,329
You're nuts.
Have you really lost your mind?

11
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,729
Goodness. Look at your face.

12
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,439
- What about your hand?
- It's fine.

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,140
You have to play the piano.
Why did you get involved in a fight?

14
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:09,140
What were you going to do if you
ended up with a serious injury?

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,340
- It hurts!
- What were you going to do?

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,540
My hand is fine!
Look at it. It's fine.

17
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:17,450
What were you going to do if you
couldn't play the piano again?

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,650
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,959
You shouldn't be apologising to me.
Your future depends on this.

20
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,760
How could you be so reckless?
How?

21
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,890
Gosh, you're so pathetic.

22
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:36,430
Do I look pathetic to you, too?

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,670
Did someone else
tell you the same thing?

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,409
Gosh. Whoever that person is, he
must be a good judge of character.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Okay. Fine!

26
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,549
I'll try my best from now on.

27
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,650
I'll win the piano competition
and get the prize money.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,349
When I give my acceptance speech,
I'll make sure to mention your name.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,049
Goodness. If only you could
walk the talk.

30
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,560
Did you choose the second piece
you will be performing?

31
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,859
I did. The 4th movement
in Chopin Piano Sonata No. 3.

32
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,030
Hey, Chopin is too difficult.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,730
The test piece is Rachmaninoff.

34
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,300
Plus, it's only a month away.
The timeline is too tight.

35
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,900
It's me we're talking about. I
should play this at the very least.

36
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,710
Look at you.
Don't be so full of yourself.

37
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,740
- But I think you can pull it off.
- You do, right?

38
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,639
Okay. I'll try it.

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,909
Sure. Let's hear it. Go.

40
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,530
(Episode 13)

41
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,300
It bothers Jung so much.

42
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,439
Would it be right for me to keep
helping In Ho with his studies?

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,710
But I'm the one who brought it up
in the first place.

44
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,740
I can't really quit now, can I?

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,319
What are you doing out here?

46
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,849
I was about to go in.

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,759
- Are you okay?
- Do I look okay to you?

48
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,560
Did you put the ointment on
at least?

49
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,400
You should be asking me
why I beat up your boyfriend.

50
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,530
I don't even know
why you gave it to me.

51
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,639
- Hey.
- Yes?

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,539
Why does this "X" have
the number two beside it?

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,349
Well...

54
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,150
It's called a square.
X squared equals A.

55
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,960
That means X is equivalent
to root A.

56
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,930
- It looks like this.
- I see.

57
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,659
- It's also called a square root.
- Root?

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,030
What does that mean?

59
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,530
Have you eaten lunch yet?

60
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,469
Of course. What about you?

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
Look at this here.

62
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,449
It says that 2 and negative 2
are both square roots of A.

63
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,020
They both equal root A.

64
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,289
I'm just heading back from lunch.

65
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,960
Is your face okay? Your co-workers
must've been surprised this morning.

66
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,009
All of my female colleagues were
so worried. I'm very popular here.

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Whatever.

68
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,949
What are you doing?

69
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,560
- Solve those equations.
- What? Okay.

70
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,639
I'm at the library helping
In Ho study right now.

71
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,180
It's something I promised him.

72
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,079
Is that okay with you?

73
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,750
No. I'm not okay with it at all.

74
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,459
You don't like it, right?

75
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,959
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,360
What should I do, then?

77
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,730
It's okay. You already promised him.

78
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,300
I know that you'll feel bad
if you quit in the middle of it.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,240
I don't want you to feel that way.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,740
I promise that I won't spend
any additional time with him.

81
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,149
By the way,

82
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,050
I'm just asking this
out of curiosity.

83
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,360
How many female colleagues
work with you in that office?

84
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:57,459
You said they were worried.
Are there a lot of them?

85
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, I guess there are
about 58,000 in total.

86
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm leaving.

87
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,629
He should've told me
that he was leaving.

88
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,180
Gosh.
I'm just going to go practise.

89
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,209
With Yeong Gon gone, I look forward
to coming to school every day.

90
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,279
Don't you feel the same way?

91
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,649
You're right. I haven't seen him
for a few days.

92
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,819
Maybe he applied
for a leave of absence.

93
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,720
It would be too embarrassing
for him to come to school.

94
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,189
By the way, why is everyone studying
so hard when the exam is far away?

95
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,360
They're making me nervous.

96
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,629
- It must be the graduation exam.
- Right.

97
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,730
All fourth-year students must
pass it in order to graduate.

98
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,240
Aren't you going to
take the exam, Seol?

99
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,699
You can apply for it when you're
in your third year.

100
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,810
I've been thinking about it,

101
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,339
but will I be able to pass
if I start studying for it now?

102
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,750
I heard that our department's
exam is very difficult.

103
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,649
Excuse me.
Even if you take it right now,

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,350
your mark will be a lot higher than
Do Hyun and Sang Cheol over there.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,360
- Bo Ra. Let's study together.
- No, thank you.

106
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,459
I rarely say no to you,
but I can't do that.

107
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,930
I'll just get a business
license instead.

108
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,930
When I get into my fourth year,
I'll start an online boutique.

109
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,569
I already talked to my dad about it.

110
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,240
Right. You wouldn't need to
take the graduation exam.

111
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,009
I'm jealous.

112
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,410
Hey, what are you having
so much fun with?

113
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,540
Gosh, why are you trying
to peek into my phone?

114
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,750
What's the big deal?
I look at it all the time.

115
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,310
- You should stop doing that.
- What?

116
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,920
I want to protect my privacy.

117
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,850
Gosh. Did you forget that
you volunteered to be my servant?

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,720
I'll get going now.

119
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,259
I'll take this.

120
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,120
Goodness.

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,829
- He's acting so weird these days.
- In what way?

122
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,230
He doesn't hang out with me.

123
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,230
He ignores my messages
and I can't get a hold of him.

124
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,329
- I see.
- What's going on with him?

125
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,139
He's probably seeing someone.

126
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,139
What? He's such a baby though.

127
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,310
The girl will practically
have to raise him.

128
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,209
Why? Just take a look at him.

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,850
He's tall, handsome and masculine.

130
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,279
Girls would like him.

131
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,649
Why don't you date him?

132
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,049
You're being ridiculous.

133
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,960
I guess he went to practice.

134
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,120
Why did you leave without
telling me earlier?

135
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,759
You should really be studying
a lot harder.

136
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,200
How can you slack off?

137
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,429
You don't need to help me
with studying any more.

138
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,740
I can do it by myself.

139
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,039
Is he doing this because he knows
that I feel uncomfortable?

140
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,850
He seems different...

141
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,350
from how he normally is.

142
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,120
Why is he being like this?

143
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,279
By any chance,

144
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,049
is it because of me?

145
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,019
What?

146
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,190
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,570
I don't have time because I have to
prepare for the competition.

148
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,000
Competition? Are you competing
in a piano competition?

149
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,200
When? What kind of
competition is it?

150
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,210
Well, it's just a small competition.

151
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,440
What does that matter?
I'm so happy for you!

152
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,950
What is it?

153
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,019
It's nothing.

154
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,000
Cutie Pie! Cutie Pie.

155
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,039
Come on, sleep.

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,840
What do you think? It suits you!
Cutie Pie!

157
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,210
Goodness.

158
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,320
Cutie Pie. In Ho.

159
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,159
How about this?

160
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,440
This is driving me nuts.

161
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,210
One, two, three.

162
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,350
- Four,
- Gosh, I need to sleep!

163
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,279
You're totally ruining
my beauty sleep!

164
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,350
You're such a handful, seriously.

165
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,850
- Eight, nine.
- Are you that angry about losing?

166
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,919
Do you want to build muscles
and fight Jung again?

167
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,059
- Who said that I lost?
- Goodness.

168
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,029
You let him beat you up.
He has so much more money than you.

169
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,730
You'll lose to him in love, as well.

170
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,330
You're a pathetic loser

171
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,539
- You're a loner covered in scars
- Shut it, seriously.

172
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,200
Does Seol know?

173
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,070
Does she know that you like her?

174
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:45,809
You can hang out with her now
because you guys are friends,

175
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,350
but it won't be that way
if she finds out.

176
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,750
Shut your mouth
and go to bed.

177
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,220
You're not even denying it any more.

178
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,960
What is love

179
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,190
What do you say?
Shall I help you?

180
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,200
- Just shut it and go to bed.
- You're totally at a disadvantage.

181
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,070
- Look at you. You're all beaten up.
- Have you really gone crazy?

182
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,309
- You better stay in your room.
- Stop making so much noise, then!

183
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,309
Gosh.

184
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,039
I'll be quiet.
I won't make any noise.

185
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,049
Don't come out.

186
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,120
- One, two.
- You little...

187
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,250
Yes, I'll be there shortly.

188
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,960
What are you so happy about?

189
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,360
It's the weekend so I guess
you have a date.

190
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,029
What brings you here?

191
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,940
Do I need your permission to
walk around in my neighbourhood?

192
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,269
Well, that's not what I meant.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,039
Do you suspect and dislike
every single thing I do?

194
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,440
I don't like the way you're
looking at me right now.

195
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,549
Look at you.

196
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,750
You're a lot feistier than you look.

197
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,720
I see. Is that why Jung likes you?

198
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,460
I'll be straightforward with you.

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,460
I don't like how you're always
talking about Jung and provoking me.

200
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,029
Also,

201
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,029
don't go around and tell people that
you're Jung's girlfriend.

202
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,100
We'll have a problem if any of them
actually believe you.

203
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,070
Look at you.
You're quite daring, too.

204
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,139
Hey. It sounds like you're being
a little delusional.

205
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,840
You may be close to my brother
and my childhood friend,

206
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,649
but how long do you think
it will last?

207
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,549
Do you feel as if you've become
Cinderella?

208
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,549
Do you feel as if you're in a drama
being in the middle of two boys?

209
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,960
But how long have you
known Jung for?

210
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,559
I've known him for 15 years.

211
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,330
Maintaining any kind of relationship
for that long isn't easy.

212
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,629
And you. You haven't even
started any of that.

213
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,240
Know your place.

214
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,139
Yes, I know.

215
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,940
The three of them share a past
which I do not know.

216
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,139
And when it comes to those
memories, there's no room for me.

217
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,710
But I'm the one who is
beside Jung now.

218
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,320
It doesn't matter how long you've
known someone.

219
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,289
Think about it. Do you have good
relationships with the two of them?

220
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,960
- It doesn't seem that way.
- Are you provoking me?

221
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,820
How dare you...

222
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,289
Are you aware that people who
talked to me in that manner...

223
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,730
- were all beaten up by me?
- Why should I even care?

224
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,100
You can get away with that
when you're young,

225
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,539
but do you know what will happen
if you hit someone now?

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,840
- Go ahead. Try it.
- Do you think I'm scared of you?

227
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,639
What? I haven't even hit you yet.

228
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,309
Hey!

229
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,649
Don't tell Jung that I did this.
I didn't hit you!

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,549
This happened because
your nose is weird.

231
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,049
You annoy me so much.

232
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,460
Hello.

233
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,429
What are you doing?

234
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,529
You're here.

235
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,539
Did you have a nosebleed?

236
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,080
Yes.

237
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,450
Why are you laughing?

238
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,649
I had a nosebleed.

239
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,450
You should be worried about me.

240
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,450
I'm... I'm worried about you,
of course.

241
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,860
But it's just...

242
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,559
Your face looks funny with that.
Look at it.

243
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,230
It's not funny at all.

244
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,860
You look funnier.
Do you want to see?

245
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,100
It's almost healed.

246
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,440
It has gotten better.

247
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,710
Right. I think that I can stop
helping In Ho...

248
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,049
with studying.

249
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,649
I see. Is that right?

250
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,549
He's competing in a piano
competition in a month,

251
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,220
so he wants to focus on that.

252
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,350
That's great.

253
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,659
Did anything else happen?

254
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,330
I've decided to be open
and honest with him.

255
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,330
I ran into In Ho's sister
on my way here.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,139
We live in the same neighbourhood,
so I can't avoid bumping into her.

257
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:11,210
But she kept talking about you...

258
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,440
and tried to scare me.

259
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,250
To be honest, it bothered me.

260
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,950
I see.

261
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,320
I'm sorry. I did tell her
not to do that to you.

262
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,860
I'll talk to her again.

263
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,460
But this is actually
making me happy.

264
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,759
You said you'd be honest with me
and you are.

265
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,840
I told you I would.

266
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
But I feel weird.

267
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,740
I feel as if I've become
a tattletale.

268
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:46,309
What's wrong with that?
I like you more as a tattletale.

269
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,009
Do you have anything else
to tell me?

270
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,950
I don't!

271
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,350
I want to hear more stories.

272
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,750
Gosh, I'm hungry. What should I get?

273
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,919
Is that really everything?

274
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,230
You're working now
so you probably haven't...

275
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,059
taken the graduation exam, right?

276
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,200
I already passed it
at the end of last year.

277
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,130
Why do you ask?

278
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,799
You took it early, too.

279
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,269
I'm thinking of
taking it early.

280
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,069
If I can pass it now, it'll make
my life easier in many ways.

281
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,539
That's true.

282
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,710
But I'm not sure if I can prepare
for it along with the final exams.

283
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,119
Do you want my sample tests?

284
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,289
What? You have sample tests?

285
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,450
Of course.

286
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,759
I also have a notebook with
previous final exam questions.

287
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,730
Final exam questions, too?

288
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,430
Gosh, I'd love to
borrow them from you!

289
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,529
Are you sure?

290
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,759
It seems that you like my
sample tests more than me.

291
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,430
Goodness! Not at all.
Of course not.

292
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,940
I only like them because
they're yours.

293
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,039
- I think you like them more.
- That's not true at all.

294
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,240
- You're the best!
- I'm getting second thoughts.

295
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I won't give them to you.

296
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,650
Gosh.

297
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,180
Are you actually upset?

298
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,220
You get upset and sulk all the time.

299
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,349
When did I sulk?

300
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,150
You do it every day.

301
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,089
You sulk over little things
and stop talking to me.

302
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,660
If I start thinking about
the agony you put me through...

303
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,559
You weren't exactly the victim.

304
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,230
You didn't let one thing go.

305
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,430
You got angry, interrogated me
and made me wait.

306
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:23,210
Jung, you've changed.
You're very well spoken.

307
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,740
I don't have to feel
frustrated any more.

308
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,549
I hope we can
fight like this everyday.

309
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,450
Let's fight like this from now on.

310
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,349
Gosh.

311
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,190
- I'm not giving you my notes.
- Please...

312
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,660
What can I do
to change your mind?

313
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,289
You better be good to me.

314
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,839
Hello?

315
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,450
In Ho!

316
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,150
Is this Sang Geun...

317
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,250
Where are you calling from?

318
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,750
You're in trouble.
Boss is in Seoul now.

319
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Why would he come to Seoul?

320
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,460
Do you remember that man whom
you introduced to Boss...

321
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,230
when you were working with him?

322
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,329
- The owner of the nightclub?
- Yes.

323
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,930
He's been looking for you
so Boss has been stressed out.

324
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,769
Boss got beaten up
by him the other day.

325
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,069
So, he's in Seoul looking for you.
In Ho, I'm scared.

326
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,009
This never ends, does it?

327
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,140
Don't get caught and lay low.
I'll talk to you later.

328
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,049
- Bye.
- What? Hey. Hey!

329
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,180
Do I have to leave again?
What should I do?

330
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,450
Calm down. I need to calm down.

331
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,289
Let's say that jerk
finds the institute.

332
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,230
They won't know my address. I never
registered my change of address.

333
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,930
He will have no way of finding me.

334
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,029
Don't be scared.
Don't be a coward, Baek In Ho.

335
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,430
Don't be such a coward.

336
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,339
Don't be scared, seriously.

337
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,140
Why does my stomach hurt so much?

338
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,450
Do you have your lesson today?

339
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,450
Yes.

340
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,720
Hey!

341
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,960
- Yes?
- Are you mad at me about something?

342
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,529
- No. I'm not mad.
- Then why are you being like that?

343
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,930
What's going on?

344
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,940
Nothing is going on.

345
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,039
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

346
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,339
- Do you know this guy?
- No, I don't.

347
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,309
Take a good look.
Don't just glance at it.

348
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,650
I really don't know him.

349
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,049
You, come here.

350
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,450
- Let's go this way.
- Why are you running?

351
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,549
Keep it down.

352
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,049
I'm asking you a question.

353
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,630
Boss, I don't think students here
know him.

354
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,430
Will we be able to find
someone who knows him?

355
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,339
You said many of the students here
go to that institute.

356
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
I did.

357
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,269
I'm sure we'll come across at least
one person who knows In Ho.

358
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,410
- Let's go.
- Okay.

359
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,450
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

360
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,859
I'm sorry.
I was suffocating you.

361
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,960
Are you okay?

362
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,230
What's wrong? Are you sick?

363
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,630
What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?

364
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,529
Goodness, why is she...

365
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,140
Hey, wake up.

366
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Okay, let's go.
Let me take you to a hospital.

367
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,519
I need a doctor.

368
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,690
Excuse me. Please examine her.

369
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,920
Okay. I'll be right back.

370
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,720
- This way, please.
- She fainted.

371
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,390
You can lay her on that bed.

372
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:06,329
I was covering her mouth
with my hand.

373
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,430
Okay.

374
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,230
Did I suffocate her?

375
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,930
- She's over there.
- Oh, my.

376
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:43,829
Seol!

377
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,309
- In Ho, is Seol okay?
- Yes.

378
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,609
Gosh, what happened?

379
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,410
The doctor said that she has
stress-induced gastritis.

380
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,309
The pain has subsided
so you don't need to worry.

381
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,710
She just needs to rest
for a couple of days.

382
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,079
Gosh, thank goodness.

383
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,220
She takes after her mother
on all the bad things.

384
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:06,819
- This happened last year, too.
- I almost had a heart attack.

385
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:10,130
Why do you look worse
than her?

386
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,099
- You must've been worried.
- Shut it.

387
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,829
I'm sure he was worried.

388
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,069
She fainted in front of him.

389
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,299
In Ho.

390
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,910
I'm grateful to have you around.
Thank you.

391
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,210
Please don't mention it.

392
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,680
- Seol. Are you okay?
- Mum!

393
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,049
No, no. Don't get up.

394
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,720
I told you to go and see a doctor
when the symptoms first started.

395
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,890
You didn't take my advice.
You made me worry.

396
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,630
You must've been really stressed out
to faint like this.

397
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,930
You're staying here overnight.
End of story.

398
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Okay.

399
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,799
I should let Jung know.

400
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,700
Don't. I'll call him later.

401
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,009
He's working now.

402
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,609
Is his work more important?
You're at a hospital.

403
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,140
Tell him to come by this evening.

404
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,279
Just leave them be.
They will figure it out.

405
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,410
- Why are you stressing her out?
- She doesn't know what she's doing.

406
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,150
Her condition is caused by stress!

407
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,630
How did that jerk
find which school I go to?

408
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,509
What if he finds the restaurant,
too?

409
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,519
If Mad Hair gets hurt because of me,
I should just die.

410
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,000
Gosh, what was that for?

411
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,500
Was I supposed to give you
a heads up about it?

412
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,509
I'm being nice to you because
you turned yourself in, you rat.

413
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,609
I was so fond of you.

414
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,410
How dare you run away with my money!
You're worse than a rat.

415
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Well...

416
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,019
If you paid me my wages on time
and didn't...

417
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,630
That brazen mouth of yours
could cost you a lot.

418
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,230
Listen.

419
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,230
Enough of that. You should
just come back with me.

420
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,170
If you do, I'll forgive you
for stealing from me.

421
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,269
That darn 5,000 dollars?

422
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,410
- I'll pay you back.
- Did you say 5,000 dollars?

423
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,410
I guess you don't know
how to calculate.

424
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,410
Don't forget the interest
it's been accumulating.

425
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,819
You owe me 10,000 dollars.

426
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,089
Considering our friendship,

427
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,720
I was nice enough to give
you a discount.

428
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,819
- That's complete nonsense.
- Then what?

429
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,799
Will you go back to Busan with me?
Big Boss is waiting for you.

430
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,799
If you go back, each of us can
get a district and live lavishly.

431
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,670
Whether it's 5,000 or 10,000,
you have no money anyway.

432
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,910
My life may be pathetic right now,

433
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,410
but I will never become a gangster.

434
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,210
I'll pay that darn money back.

435
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Will you?

436
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,420
Fine. Pay me back.

437
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,019
I'm giving you a week.
Got it?

438
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,519
If you can't pay me back by then,
you'll have to come with me.

439
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:29,329
By the way,

440
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,430
I heard you moved to the countryside
but you're still in Seoul.

441
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:35,029
I guess you found someone
special.

442
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,700
You're so gullible, you idiot.

443
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,410
This is why I like you.

444
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,079
Don't even think about
running.

445
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:48,880
I can easily hurt everyone
around you.

446
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:50,910
Remember that.

447
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,220
You have 1 week to
pay me 10,000 dollars.

448
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,619
Let's go, Sang Geun.

449
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,319
Punk.

450
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,900
Bye, In Ho.

451
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,009
I thought all the stressful
things were over now.

452
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,980
Is it because I'm
beginning to feel relaxed?

453
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,190
Jung. I'm at a hospital because
I had a stomachache.

454
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,259
I'm staying here overnight.

455
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,009
Hello?

456
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,210
You called me right away.

457
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:57,779
Are you okay?

458
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,720
Is your family with you?

459
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,519
Okay. I'll come now.

460
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,089
I can leave work early.

461
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,319
Jung. We have a meeting in an hour.

462
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,619
Please prepare the reports
for the meeting.

463
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,529
- What is this meeting for?
- He wants to go over...

464
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,259
the marketing plan
for next quarter again.

465
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,529
He's probably not happy with it.

466
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,130
The director will be there too,
so make sure you do a thorough job.

467
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,670
Gosh.

468
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,079
Something came up.
I might be a little late.

469
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:28,509
I'll be there as soon as possible.

470
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,049
I'm really sorry.

471
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,920
It's okay. Take your time.

472
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,529
(In Ho)

473
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,930
I didn't even get the chance
to thank him.

474
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,670
But earlier,

475
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:59,309
it looked like he was trying to
hide from someone.

476
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:03,910
I don't even know any more.

477
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,519
Yes.

478
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,420
I should avoid him for Jung.

479
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,519
It's the right thing to do.

480
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,529
But he's someone who was always
there for me when I needed him.

481
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,730
He's a good friend.

482
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,130
Can I really end the friendship
like this because of Jung?

483
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,039
Where is my emergency fund?

484
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:34,609
What happened?

485
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,289
Baek In Ha, you little...

486
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
What am I going to do?

487
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,910
Should I move out of here?

488
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,710
Then where will In Ha go?

489
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,720
(Mad Hair)

490
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,259
Thanks for today.

491
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:24,930
By the way,

492
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,930
is everything okay?

493
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:32,599
You should be worrying
about yourself.

494
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,309
Goodness.

495
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,059
Jung.

496
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,160
You're awake.

497
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,430
I am.

498
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,829
Are you feeling better now?

499
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,430
Yes.

500
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,230
I'm totally fine.

501
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,799
Whatever.

502
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,799
Do you know how worried I was?

503
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,269
My heart almost
jumped out of my chest.

504
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,880
Why are you talking like
Eun Taek now?

505
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,910
Seeing you smile is
making me feel better.

506
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,150
I'm not kidding though.
I was really worried.

507
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,519
I was going to skip the meeting
and come here.

508
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,319
Goodness, don't be so silly.
Those things could get you fired.

509
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,720
I won't get fired.

510
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:28,930
You're such a show off.

511
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:31,789
By the way, where's your family?

512
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:35,160
My mum said that
she'd stay with me overnight,

513
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,529
but I sent her home.

514
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,000
There isn't really anywhere
for her to sleep...

515
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,599
and she has to open
the restaurant in the morning.

516
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,410
Joon told me that...

517
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,410
In Ho brought you here.

518
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,710
What happened was...

519
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:52,920
Well, I bumped into him at school.

520
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,619
And my stomachache worsened
all of a sudden.

521
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,619
You don't have to tell me
all of that.

522
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,029
I'm just glad that
he happened to be around.

523
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,430
I'm a little upset though.

524
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,329
I feel like I'm never beside you...

525
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,230
whenever things like this
happen.

526
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,700
You're busy with work.

527
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,509
It's okay.

528
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,509
Move over a little bit.

529
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,910
It will be tight though.

530
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,619
Come on.

531
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,089
There isn't enough space.

532
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,730
Gosh, I feel cramped.

533
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,299
You've been really
stressed out, right?

534
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,640
Because of Min Soo and Yeong Gon.

535
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,710
In Ha, too.

536
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,619
I'll make sure none of that
ever happens again.

538
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,720
From now on,

539
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,519
I'll always be right beside you.

540
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,329
Really?

541
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:17,630
Yes.

542
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,990
I can't believe I have
to go to school.

543
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,029
It's a beautiful day, at least.

544
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,869
Hi.

545
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,039
Mr. Hong asked me to give it to you.

546
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,009
I heard you're
heading to school now.

547
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,410
Yes.

548
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,049
He said that it's medicine
for your stomach.

549
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,320
Aren't you going to school?

550
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,889
I have to go somewhere else.

551
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,630
What was that? Did he come
all the way here for me?

552
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,800
Well, thanks!

553
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,510
He didn't even say bye.

554
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,780
Is something going on?

555
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Seol! How are you feeling?

556
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,719
Gosh, I was so worried about you.

557
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,159
It's okay. It was just
my gastritis acting up.

558
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,260
It happens when I'm stressed out.

559
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,630
I told you not to let
your stress pile up.

560
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,099
You keep everything bottled up
and it's affecting your health.

561
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Seol, drink this.

562
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,309
My mum heard that you're unwell
and brewed this tea for you.

563
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,679
She said that drinking cold water
isn't good for gastritis.

564
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,420
Thanks, Eun Taek.
I really appreciate this.

565
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,050
Where is mine?

566
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,989
- Are you feeling ill?
- No.

567
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,320
Then you don't need it.

568
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,320
You neither get stressed
nor keep things bottled up inside.

569
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,429
I have a shift today
so I have to go now.

570
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,730
- Feel better soon, Seol.
- Thanks.

571
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,269
Bye!

572
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Whatever. He's being so cold to me.

573
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,210
What's going on?
What's happening between you two?

574
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,909
What do you think is going on?

575
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,210
This is what's happening.

576
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:43,409
- You shouldn't have rejected him.
- It's not that I don't like him.

577
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,409
What is it then?

578
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,050
I don't want to break up with him.

579
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,420
What are you talking about?

580
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,420
If we date, we'll break up
eventually.

581
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,929
Then I won't be able to
see him after that.

582
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,800
I don't ever want to part from
people I like again.

583
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,829
What would I do
without you and Eun Taek?

584
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,699
I just want to have you guys
in my life like this forever.

585
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,309
Bo Ra, you should take this.

586
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,820
It's okay.

587
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,889
Just take it. Bo Ra...

588
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,320
Gosh, stop it.

589
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,820
Stop it, seriously.

590
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:31,429
Customer number 212.

591
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:32,929
Yes.

592
00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:38,170
How may I help you?

593
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,269
I'd like to get a loan.

594
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes, Sir. Would you like to get
a credit loan or a secured loan?

595
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,210
- I'd like a credit loan, please.
- All right.

596
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,320
- Do you have proof of employment?
- Pardon me?

597
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,820
A letter from your employer to prove
that you're currently employed.

598
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,619
I see. I currently work part-time
at a noodle restaurant.

599
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,989
I'm sorry. In order to qualify
for a credit loan, you must be...

600
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:07,159
employed by a company that is part
of the public insurance programme...

601
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,070
or be a business owner.

602
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,699
Then what about a credit card?
Something that allows cash advance.

603
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm sorry. With your current
employment status,

604
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,309
it'd be difficult for you
to get a credit card issued.

605
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,150
If that's the case...

606
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,420
Okay.

607
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,519
Gosh, Jung's notes are
so organised.

608
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,320
How did he even do this?

609
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,199
Hey, Seol! I heard that you're
taking the graduation exam.

610
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,900
Let's study together, Seol.

611
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,900
Oh? Those notes look organised.
Let me see.

612
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,409
I'll just have a quick look.

613
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,179
Gosh, they're very well organised.
Oh! They're Jung's sample tests!

614
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,780
Wow. He must've given them to you
because you're his girlfriend.

615
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,989
That's all you need to study.
Goodness.

616
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,019
We can share them, right?

617
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,219
Jung worked hard on
organising these notes.

618
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,329
- Sorry?
- What's that look?

619
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:12,699
Do you not want to share them?

620
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,329
Well, that's not it.

621
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,400
I'll ask Jung.

622
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,300
Why do you need to ask him?

623
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,869
He gave them to you
so they're yours now.

624
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,809
Is it because you don't want to
share them with anyone?

625
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,150
Gosh, seriously. You have to
share these with everyone.

626
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,920
Guys. Seol has Jung's sample tests.
Who needs them?

627
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,219
- Me! Me!
- Me!

628
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,889
Do you need them?
Raise your hand if you do!

629
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,420
- Me!
- I knew it. Look at that.

630
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,789
- I can't stand this idiot.
- Look. Everyone needs them.

631
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,429
Many fourth-year students
are in need of sample tests.

632
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,329
You have to lend them to us.
Those notes have to be shared.

633
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,929
You like this snack, right?

634
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,429
Let's make an exchange.

635
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,010
- I'd rather not.
- Really? What do you want?

636
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:02,079
- Seol! Hi!
- Hi!

637
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,780
Seol, come and sit here.
I saved a seat for you.

638
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,619
- Seol, are you feeling better?
- Yes, thanks for asking.

639
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,719
Right, you were in a hospital.

640
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,420
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

641
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,829
You're pretty even when
you're feeling sick.

642
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,230
Hey. Give this to her.

643
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:24,269
Seol! I bought this.
Do you want it? It's really good.

644
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,329
- Well...
- It's really delicious.

645
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Don't share it with Bo Ra.
Eat it by yourself, okay?

646
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,309
All right.

647
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,809
Seol, Seol. Do you know
the answer to this?

648
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,309
I really don't understand this.
Can you explain it to me?

649
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,920
- I haven't gone over that part yet.
- Really?

650
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,420
You know this part.
Tell her you'll teach her.

651
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,519
Seol, Seol. I studied up to here.

652
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,730
I can teach you.
Come and sit with me.

653
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,630
Seol doesn't need your help.

654
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,329
Seol.

655
00:39:56,929 --> 00:39:59,900
You were discharged this morning.
Why are you already skipping meals?

656
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,510
I told you that
you have to eat well.

657
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:05,510
I had a really busy day.

658
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,380
- What's my total?
- It's six dollars.

659
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,420
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

660
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,320
Did everything go well
in the afternoon?

661
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,159
Yes.

662
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,329
You went to practise the piano,
right?

663
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,699
Is it any of your business?

664
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,110
Why are you talking to me like that?

665
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:04,900
(Hammer)

666
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,079
Hey, Baek In Ho.

667
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,510
What do you want from me?

668
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,380
You let your guard down.

669
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,420
You had no idea that Sang Geun
was shadowing you.

670
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,420
I won't stay quiet
if you're going to be like this.

671
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,690
What did I do?

672
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,030
Did I vandalise the restaurant?
Did I hurt anyone?

673
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:33,429
Think of it as an insurance.

674
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:38,699
By the way, your sister is very hot.
She's tall, too.

675
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,139
You piece of...

676
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,500
In Ho.

677
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:46,679
- Go back inside.
- What's wrong with you?

678
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:49,409
Hey.

679
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,719
- What?
- Stop joking around.

680
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,820
Don't come out until I tell you to.

681
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,889
Hey!

682
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,150
Mum!

683
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,429
In Ho, behave yourself.

684
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,170
I trust that you won't make me
have to come here again.

685
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,139
Jung.

686
00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:24,309
The sample tests you gave me.

687
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,179
Could I make copies
for people in our department?

688
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,989
Sang Cheol saw me looking
through your sample tests.

689
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,420
Are you going to share it with them?

690
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,630
Yes, if you're okay with it.

691
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:41,030
To be honest, I don't want you
to share my notes with them.

692
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,829
Aren't you sick of them...

693
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:45,800
demanding things from you and
taking everything for granted?

694
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,500
If you try to do everything
they ask of you,

695
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,309
you just end up wasting
your time and energy.

696
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,239
You know that now.

697
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:55,079
They're just trying to use you,

698
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,679
so you don't need to
worry about them.

699
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,119
Just think about it.
Don't take it too seriously.

700
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,019
Listening to what you just said
has already put me in deep thoughts.

701
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,730
Jung, sleep well.

702
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,429
You too. Sweet dreams.

703
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,210
I can't believe that scum
even showed up here.

704
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:32,409
Even if I get the rent deposit back,
I'll still need 3,000 dollars.

705
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,690
I'm so pretty

706
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,829
You're home! How do I look?
Do you like this outfit?

707
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,059
What did you do
with my emergency fund?

708
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,300
I spent it all a long time ago.

709
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:48,699
I thought you left it here for me.

710
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:54,500
- Do you have any money right now?
- I have nothing.

711
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,909
How did you buy
all those things, then?

712
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:58,610
With the credit card Jung gave me.

713
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,909
Don't even think about cash advance.
I already went over the limit.

714
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,679
Spending money is all you're
capable of doing, isn't it?

715
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,519
Do you live only for today?

716
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,989
- You have no plans for your future!
- Do you have a plan?

717
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,630
Why are you lecturing me when
you also live from hand to mouth?

718
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,690
Gosh! I should find a room
and move out or something.

719
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,130
You throw a fit every time
you see me.

720
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,530
I get that your life is miserable,
but don't take things out on me.

721
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,829
Get out! I'm so sick of this.

722
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,110
Gosh.

723
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,010
What's wrong with him?

724
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,929
I haven't seen you in a while.

725
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:56,429
Yes, Sir.

726
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,099
How have you been?

727
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm sorry I didn't call you
in advance.

728
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,280
No, I'm happy to see you.
Have a seat.

729
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:08,780
You're always welcome here.

730
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:15,619
I...

731
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,320
I have a favour to ask you.

732
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,320
A favour?

733
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,929
I have a bit of a situation,

734
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:28,329
so I need some money.

735
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,929
- It's not a lot...
- In Ho.

736
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,000
Until when are you going to
live like this?

737
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,500
Pardon me?

738
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,969
I understand why you resent Jung.

739
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:41,510
But both of you are adults now...

740
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,409
and he's focusing on
working hard.

741
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,219
Did you have to have
a fist fight with him?

742
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,050
Did Jung tell you everything
already?

743
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,219
I don't need to hear anything.
I can tell from your faces.

744
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,929
What is the problem?

745
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:04,130
I feel that I've done my best
to support and guide the two of you.

746
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,030
What did I do wrong?

747
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,300
You resent Jung and blame him
for everything.

748
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,610
You keep causing trouble
so I'm very disappointed in you.

749
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,309
Mr. Yu.

750
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,809
You know why I don't like Jung.

751
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,019
I apologised to you many times.

752
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,050
Until when are you going to
go on about that incident?

753
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,019
You apologised to me, not Jung.

754
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:27,519
He doesn't even feel
an ounce of guilt.

755
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,929
Have you forgotten the comfortable
lives you and In Ha have enjoyed?

756
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:36,030
You aren't his siblings but
Jung accepted the two of you.

757
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,929
He had to make sacrifices, too.

758
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,269
But the two of you are
ungrateful for...

759
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,070
what Jung and I have done for you.

760
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,989
Goodness.

761
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,260
I should've known.

762
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,329
You two clearly
share the same blood.

763
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,429
- What did you say?
- I know it for a fact now.

764
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,699
You really didn't care about us
when you brought us here, did you?

765
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,300
But I...

766
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,400
I thought of you as...

767
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,409
I made you take care of In Ha,

768
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,150
so I already felt terrible about
asking you for help.

769
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,920
But after hearing what you said,
I don't even want your help.

770
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,420
I'll get going. Please take care.

771
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,929
Goodness.

772
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,369
Yes. Jung made a good point.

773
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,039
They put me through total agony.

774
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,050
Seol. Please let me borrow
the sample tests.

775
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,989
You know that this is
my ninth semester, right?

776
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:15,389
Just help me this one time.
I won't ask you for help after this.

777
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,889
Please help me. Please?

778
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,230
I'll make one copy.

779
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:26,070
This is the last time.
I'm helping him for the last time.

780
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,769
This will really be
the last time, right?

781
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,780
- Isn't Seol so selfish?
- I know. She totally is.

782
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,650
It's not like she worked hard
for those notes.

783
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,980
She got them from her boyfriend.
She's being obnoxious.

784
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,349
I really can't stand her.

785
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,090
She changed after
she started going out with Jung.

786
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,789
She used to do things for me
whenever I asked her for help.

787
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,960
I should've known...

788
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,659
when she got angry at us
for getting a D last semester.

789
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,360
I'm so annoyed that
I have to suck up to her now.

790
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,030
Who would want to be friends with
her if it weren't for those notes?

791
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,269
She's so annoying.

792
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:03,039
We still have to get our hands
on those notes.

793
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:04,369
You know how meticulous he is.

794
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,739
I took a quick look and those
sample tests are the best.

795
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,110
- How can we persuade her?
- We should keep sucking up to her.

796
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,980
Seol. Do you want to
have lunch with us?

797
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,789
Eun Jae said it's on her.
Come with us.

798
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,289
- I already made plans.
- I see.

799
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:25,260
Do you want to meet us
for coffee later? It's on me.

800
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,559
I don't have time for that.

801
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,230
I have to study for the exam.

802
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,369
I guess you have a lot to study.

803
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,170
You're lucky you have
the sample tests.

804
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,070
They're dying to take you out
for food and coffee.

805
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,110
They're obviously trying to
suck up to you.

806
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,880
- Let's go for lunch.
- Lunch?

807
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,179
You said that you had plans.

808
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,949
I had to tell them something.

809
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,679
Seol. Seol!

810
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,380
Can we talk for a second?

811
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:53,590
What is it about?

812
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,590
Don't you have something
to give me?

813
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,289
No, I don't.

814
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:00,659
I texted you this morning. Are you
really going to be like this?

815
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,230
Aren't you sick of them
demanding things from you...

816
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,469
and taking everything for granted?

817
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,269
Yes. I'm so sick and tired
of all this.

818
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:11,010
Those sample tests. Are they yours?

819
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
What?

820
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,940
Why do you have to talk like that?

821
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:17,179
There's nothing wrong with
asking you to share them with me.

822
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,880
We're in the same department.
You're being greedy.

823
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,949
I had no idea that
you were this selfish.

824
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,190
Guys.

825
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,889
- Am I the only one who thinks this?
- No.

826
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:26,489
- You agree with me, right?
- Yes.

827
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,760
- Just ignore him.
- Did you see that?

828
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:28,860
Hey, Seol.

829
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,659
Frankly speaking, you got
those sample tests so effortlessly.

830
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,130
That's right!
You didn't work for them.

831
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,969
Because you're being greedy
and not willing to share,

832
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,940
- everyone is upset.
- We're so upset.

833
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,199
These sample tests.

834
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,170
They're my personal possession.

835
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:45,469
Why do I have to share them
with all of you?

836
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,210
Is not sharing them that much
of a horrible thing?

837
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,679
You're in your fourth year.

838
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,949
Stop pestering me
and act appropriately.

839
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,750
What? I'm pestering you?

840
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,690
Did you just say that
I'm pestering you?

841
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,260
- You're the one that started this.
- You stay out of this.

842
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,389
- What did you say? Are you done?
- Everything she said is true!

843
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,760
- Do you think you're a gangster?
- Hey, Seol.

844
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,260
- Let's go.
- I'm pestering you?

845
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,460
What did you say?
What are you looking at?

846
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,030
Hey!

847
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,829
Hand over the sample tests
before you go!

848
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:13,670
- I'm so annoyed!
- It won't work. Let's go.

849
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,170
That witch.

850
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,179
What brings you here?

851
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,019
You know that Hanyu Group
is a big client for us.

852
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,889
They're having a launch party
for their new cosmetic product.

853
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,559
Right, I meant to tell you.

854
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,760
In Ho came by.

855
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,730
It looks like he needs money.

856
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,670
But I got emotional
during the conversation...

857
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,099
and ended it on a bad note.

858
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:53,480
It doesn't look like you know
what In Ho is going through.

859
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,780
You're the one who asked me
to look after those two.

860
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,079
What are you doing?

861
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:02,679
Let's go.

862
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,110
So I hear that it's 10,000 dollars.

863
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,079
Your debt.

864
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,480
How did you know?

865
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,219
I heard that you went to see my dad.

866
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:41,019
He was worried about you
so I looked into it.

867
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,989
It looks like
some crooks are after you.

868
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,559
So?

869
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,630
Do you have the money?

870
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:53,469
Why are you asking me this?

871
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,570
I'll give it to you.
I'll give you the money.

872
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:00,679
On the condition that
you'll stay away from Seol.

873
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,480
Whether you like Seol or not
isn't important to me.

874
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:12,219
But if you end up causing harm
to her or her family,

875
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,389
it'll be a different story.

876
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:16,860
You're at rock bottom right now,

877
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,360
but I know that you wouldn't
want to cause harm...

878
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,469
to those who care about you.

879
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,639
Hey, did you come all the way here
to tell me this?

880
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,039
You think it's a great opportunity
for you, don't you?

881
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,369
You're the one who made it happen.

882
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,579
You should've lived
your life properly.

883
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:40,150
You ran away from home
to waste your life like that.

884
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:43,690
If you can't pay him back,

885
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,289
you'll either keep running away
or get caught.

886
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,159
Do you really want to
live like that?

887
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:54,030
Putting an end to this mess
and leaving would be much better.

888
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,239
Think about it carefully.

889
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,639
Who is likely to cause
more harm to Seol?

890
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:20,889
Gosh.

891
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,269
- I'm back.
- Hi, you're back early.

892
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:33,739
You're making kimchi.
Can I help with anything?

893
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,139
It's okay. I'm almost done.

894
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,269
Go home.

895
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:39,170
- There's a lot left.
- No, don't worry.

896
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,880
Hold on. Don't take off your gloves.

897
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,480
Drop that off at In Ho's place
on your way home.

898
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,380
- You want me to drop this off?
- Yes.

899
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:53,219
I think something happened
to him today.

900
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:55,119
He called earlier to say
that he couldn't come in for work.

901
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,889
He sounded a bit ill.

902
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:00,860
I don't think he has anyone
who takes care of him.

903
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,869
Drop it off and see if he's okay.

904
00:56:07,769 --> 00:56:08,840
Get going.

905
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,070
Okay.

906
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,110
- Be safe.
- I will.

907
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:32,360
Did he step out?

908
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,980
What are you doing here?

909
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,789
I heard that you're not
feeling well.

910
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,159
Where are you coming from?

911
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,070
My mum wanted me to drop this off
for you. She made kimchi today.

912
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,639
Last time, it looked like...

913
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,679
you were trying to hide
from someone.

914
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,050
Everything is okay with you
these days, right?

915
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,349
It gets cold at night.
You should dress warmly.

916
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:44,090
And tell your mum that I said
thank you for the kimchi.

917
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,139
Why is In Ho acting like that
all of a sudden?

918
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,780
He keeps making me worry about him
and tells me not to worry.

919
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,250
What am I supposed to do?

920
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,480
Eun Taek! Where are you?

921
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:09,380
I don't have any classes
this afternoon. Let's hang out.

922
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:11,590
I can't. I'm busy.

923
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,789
What's keeping you busy?
Where are you now?

924
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,389
Where do you think I am?
I'm at school.

925
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,760
Eun Taek! We have to go in now.

926
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,559
- Who are you with?
- Well...

927
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:24,230
Hang out with Seol if you're bored.
I'll talk to you later.

928
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,869
Hey! Hey!

929
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:28,769
What was that about?

930
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,769
Seol!

931
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:34,980
Hey, Bo Ra.

932
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,150
- Let's go and find Eun Taek.
- What?

933
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,780
- Hey, where are we going?
- He must be nearby.

934
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,119
I need to find out
what's keeping him so busy.

935
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,650
- What's wrong? Are you upset?
- No!

936
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,289
What is Eun Taek doing?

937
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:50,690
That's what we're going to find out.

938
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:52,760
There he is. Gosh.

939
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,059
Oh. What is he doing?

940
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:56,230
Yes, that's great.

941
00:59:57,369 --> 00:59:58,469
Okay.

942
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:01,869
Yes, that's good.
We'll try that once more.

943
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,269
- Okay. We got enough good shots.
- Yes.

944
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:05,639
Let's try it with just Eun Taek...

945
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,940
- and his partner.
- Okay.

946
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:11,780
Wow.

947
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,780
Eun Taek looks dashing.
Look at him.

948
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,289
He looks like a model.

949
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,849
He is tall, I guess.

950
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,260
- Look more friendly.
- Just a minute.

951
01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:22,860
- Eun Taek, can you stand up?
- Yes, sure.

952
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,159
- Let's start again.
- Stand closer to her.

953
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,260
- That looks good.
- Great.

954
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,929
Good. Look at the camera, please.

955
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:35,670
Just a second. Eun Taek, come here.

956
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,039
Hand me the lint roller.

957
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:42,079
You have lint all over you.

958
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:44,679
- Do a good job, okay?
- Yes, I will.

959
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,280
Let me fix your hair.

960
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,090
You look great.

961
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,789
Eun... Eun Taek! Hi!

962
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:59,860
Why are you here?
Do you want to see me get fired?

963
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,329
Hey, you look so cool.
I thought you were a real model.

964
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,360
Who are they?

965
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,769
Eun Taek, are they your friends?

966
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:10,139
I'm sorry.
These are my close friends.

967
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,269
And this is my boss.

968
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:13,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

969
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,940
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Mo Na.

970
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,010
Go now.

971
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,380
Eun Taek is doing
a great job, right?

972
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,849
Eun Taek? He's the best.

973
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,019
Really?

974
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:27,989
Hey, she says you're the best.

975
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,289
- You're busy so we'll get going.
- Yes. Bye.

976
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:33,230
Go. See you later.

977
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,860
- Good luck!
- Bye.

978
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:41,070
We have to get back to work
and finish the shoot.

979
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:43,469
- Let's take it from the top.
- Eun Taek looks so cool today.

980
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,269
- You think so?
- Yes.

981
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,480
He looks dashing.

982
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:49,380
- That's great.
- Okay.

983
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,679
Smile more.

984
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:53,880
- Great.
- That was perfect.

985
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,690
Hey, stop. Stop playing.

986
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:07,559
What are you doing? You're just
moving your fingers.

987
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:09,559
Are you not taking it seriously
because it's a small competition?

988
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,130
Do you think you can win like this?

989
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,769
- I've been a little busy.
- What? You've been busy?

990
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:18,139
Why are you even here?
Go and take care of your business.

991
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,579
Go! Get out now!

992
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,110
Okay.

993
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:27,380
Hey. Hey!

994
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,380
Hey.

995
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,150
Aren't you getting off here?

996
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:30,570
Is something going on?

997
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,280
You were totally spaced out.
You almost missed your stop.

998
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,880
Why do you even care?

999
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:45,849
Wait.

1000
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:54,030
You're going through something
these days, aren't you?

1001
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,659
You keep missing work...

1002
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,369
and it doesn't look like you're
practising for the competition.

1003
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:01,039
What's going on?

1004
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,139
It's none of your business.

1005
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:10,679
Is it because...

1006
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:16,019
you need money?

1007
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:19,889
I heard that you asked
to get paid in advance.

1008
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,590
Whether I...

1009
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,960
Whether I got paid
in advance or not...

1010
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,030
Whether I need money or not,
it's none of your business!

1011
01:05:32,469 --> 01:05:34,269
Yes, it's none of my business.

1012
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:37,869
You're right.

1013
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:39,739
It has nothing to do with me,

1014
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:43,980
but I'm still worried about you!

1015
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:47,480
You told me that I should vent
on you when I'm stressed out.

1016
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:50,380
But why can't you tell me anything?

1017
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,690
Why are you worried about me?

1018
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:00,960
I'm not a good person.

1019
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,030
Why do you think that?

1020
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:07,469
I don't know what other people
think about you,

1021
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:09,639
but to me, you're a good person.

1022
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:15,840
If you're going through something,

1023
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,750
my family and I will help you.

1024
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,780
So tell me, please.

1025
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,469
You haven't found out who stole
the sample tests, right?

1026
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,570
Stop! Are you crazy?

1027
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,880
What did you and Sang Cheol
talk about earlier?

1028
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,940
He passed the first screening
for the internship at the company.

1029
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:24,579
I wanted to give this back to you.

1030
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,849
- You didn't have to give it back.
- I can't keep it.

1031
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:28,050
It's not mine.

1032
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:29,480
The fact that we're friends...

1033
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,250
means that I can see
other women...

1034
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:35,019
and that you can date other guys.
That's what it means.

1035
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:37,159
Yes, I like you.

1036
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,460
Just one month. Give me one month.

1037
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:41,960
What will happen
after a month?

1038
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,730
- I'm going to leave here.
- You jerk.

1039
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,670
You've been fooled by Jung.

1040
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,639
Seol, why are you being quiet?
You know everything.

1041
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,039
Listen, you jerk. Just because
your dad owns the company,

1042
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,340
doesn't mean you get to fool me and
do whatever you want.

1043
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:53,769
How dare you.

1044
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,780
Right. This is who you really are.

1045
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,179
If you really want to do this,
you better brace yourself.

1046
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,679
- Seol.
- You can't handle Jung.

1047
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,079
You should know your place.
