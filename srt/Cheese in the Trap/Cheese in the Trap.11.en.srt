Do you want to go for food?
Let's go.

Come to your senses, Hong Seol.
You can't let that smile fool you.

Don't even be curious.

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,359
Just stop looking at it.

Gosh, Dad!

Do you know how much Mum
gives me for my allowance?

17
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:12,709
Gosh, stop it.

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,680
As a man, how can I
keep letting her treat me?

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,920
- Please?
- Goodness.

20
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:19,620
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,620
Why are you nagging me like your mum?

22
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,189
Gosh, my son! When will you grow up?

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,659
What can I do?

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,760
Here.

25
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,799
Don't be discouraged.

She saw it.
She clearly saw it.

31
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:55,120
If those two don't break up after this,

32
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,189
I'll spread the rumour
all over our department.

33
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,489
It will humiliate Jung so much.

34
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,560
If Jung is gone, I'll be the only...

35
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,359
good catch around Seol, right?

36
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,099
We will look at other examples...

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
Gosh, the game is over now.

- Thank you!

40
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,110
All right.
Then shall I go and...

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,409
talk to Seol about that photo?

42
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,009

Let's go quickly.

- Why?

44

It's not even lunchtime yet.
Why are you already hungry?

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,819
Yeong Gon has been staring at us...

46
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,020
smirking like a pervert.
Let's get out of here. Hurry up.

47
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,490
Let's go.
Hurry.

48
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,189
Gosh, the last thing I want
is dealing with that crazy stalker.

49

Hurry.
Let's hurry.

50
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,030
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- Ouch, okay!

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,159
Gosh, don't rush me.
Did we do anything wrong?

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,300
Wow, who is that girl?

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,569
Is she in the Fashion Design Department?

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,300
Goodness! She is so tall.

55
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,400
She looks like a giraffe.

56
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,599
Don't be jealous, Bo Ra.

57
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,509
I'm sure she gets rained on before you do.

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,610
Eun Taek, that was mean.
I'm going to pinch your nose.

59
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,909
Hey, Yeong Gon.
I need to talk to you.

60
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,909
Let's talk later.
I need to go, okay?

61
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,310
Let's just talk now.

62
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,120
You're acting really suspiciously
these days.

63
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,219
What's going on between you and Seol?

64
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:03,219
- Listen. Will you keep fooling me?
- Gosh, stop it already! Okay?

65
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,860
Are you my wife?

66
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,990
- Hey.
- Seriously!

67
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,689
- Yeong Gon, that's not right.
- What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,430
- What's wrong?
- Hey.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
Were you just going to hit me?

70
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,900
- Well... No. Da Young, I was...
- Yes!

71
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,699
How can you do this to me?

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,669
You, jerk!

73
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,379
You... Crazy jerk.
You're so horrible!

74
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,710
How dare you cheat on me!

75
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,650
How could you do this to me?

76
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,990
You said that you only love me!

77
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,789
How can you even call yourself
a human being?

78
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,289
I thought something was fishy.
My gut instinct was right!

79
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,599
Is she your another girlfriend?
Yes?

80
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,300
- You, jerk! I hate you!
- Stop it, seriously!

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,169
Wow.
Is she Ronda Rousey?

82
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,810
She must be a UFC champion.

83
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,210
He deserves it.

84
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,909
I'm going to teach you a lesson today,
you jerk!

85
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,650
You're a piece of trash!

86
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,819
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

87
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,020
Yes! Let's just die together, you jerk!

88
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Everyone knows that I'm crazy, okay?

89
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,189
You cheated on me so many times, you jerk!

90
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:17,329
- You, jerk...
- Stop it now! Seriously!

91
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,459
You! Stop recording!

92
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,800
Da Young.
Da Young, don't believe her, okay?

93
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,300
Excuse me.

94
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,100
Who are you? What in the world
are you doing right now?

95
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,910
Goodness, I feel so bad for her.

96
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,509
What is going on now?

97
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,120
How does she know Yeong Gon?

98
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,889
Da Young, this photo
is obviously manipulated.

99
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,829
- He doesn't even have a nice body.
- Hey, how can you...

100
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,329
Look.
This is your phone number.

101
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,800
This birthmark on your chest is
at the exact same spot too, you jerk!

102
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,600
- She knows where his birthmark is!
- Isn't he out of his mind?

103
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,810
- It's a big birthmark.
- By the way, why is that...

104
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,709
model-looking girl going out with him?

105
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,110
- This is crazy.
- Hold on. Hold on.

106
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,209
- Here. Look at this.
- What is that?

107
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,009
Look at this, okay?

108
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,579
- What is that photo?
- I don't know this girl, okay?

109
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:12,819
She is Jung's...

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,220
real girlfriend, okay?

111
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,120
- What?
- Look at Jung's face here.

112
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,490
Look at how happy he looks in this photo!

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,689
Goodness!

114
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,189
Do you all understand it now?

115
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,100
This crazy girl. This mad girl
is Jung's real girlfriend, okay?

116
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,100
- What?
- I caught them cheating, so...

117
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,300
That moment,

118
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,300
I felt infuriated.

119
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,100
Because of that jerk, people would...

120
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,009
- misunderstand and badmouth Jung.
- Look at this, everyone!

121
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,209
Yes, you should look at this.

122
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,110
- Take a good look at this.
- Okay, don't touch me.

123
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,579
What are you doing now?

124
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,810
What are you trying to do to Jung now?

125
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,610
What a perfect timing.

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,420
You saw this photo, right?
I sent it to you.

127
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,019
Yes, I saw it.
What about it?

128
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,290
This girl.
She's someone I know.

129
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,490
- What?
- Hey, Seol.

130
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,089
Hey, Seol.

131
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,300
Do you really know her?

132
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,500
Yes.

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,500
She is Jung's childhood friend
who grew up with him.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,100
I know her younger brother too.

135
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,610
Plus, what's wrong
with her linking arms with Jung?

136
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,610
She lived abroad for many years,

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,009
so this kind of physical contact
is very natural for her.

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,709
Gosh, Seol...

139
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,819
I'm sorry about everything.

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,189
I didn't know that
you care about me this much.

141
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,819
Don't tell Jung about this, okay?

142
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,790
I'll feel much worse about myself if he finds out.

143
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,189
Seol, don't put on an act.
This isn't the right time for it.

144
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,589
I know that you don't know this girl!

145
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,600
When you talked to her on the phone,
you had no idea who she...

146
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,600
- Stop lying!
- Gosh, you stop lying!

147
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,370
How in the world would you know this girl?
How?

148
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,600
Goodness.
I'm crazy for going out...

149
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,269
with a jerk like you.

150
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,910
Listen. What did you tell me?
You'll be on my side?

151
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,540
You only love me?

152
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,610
Everything you told me is a lie!
Lies after lies!

153
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,709
- You're such a jerk!
- Da Young!

154
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,110
Da Young, I can explain everything.

155
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,920
- You trust me, right? Come here.
- Go away! Trust what?

156
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,019
Get lost, you disgusting jerk.

157
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,019
Don't get in touch with me
ever again, okay?

158
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,220
Da Young.

159
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,490
- Da Young...
- What is all this mess?

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,000
- Ouch! You!
- Don't ever call me again, okay?

161
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,410
Hey, Seol.

162
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,370
- Seol, I'm going to hurt you...
- You're a piece of trash.

163
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,279
- What?
- You're a helpless piece of trash.

164
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,709
Yeong Gon, did you see
that topless photo of yours?

165
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,420
Yeong Gon.
Are you working out these days? Yes?

166
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,089
- You have a sexy birthmark.
- Cheer up, friend!

167
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,689
Gosh, why did he do such a thing?

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,199
This girl.

169
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,199
She's someone I know.

170
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,709
She lived abroad for many years! Hello!

171
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,810
That girl is clever.

172
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,709
Excuse me.

173
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,220
Please spare me a few minutes.

174
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,790
Earlier...

175
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,660
Yeong Gon was talking total nonsense,

176
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,569
so I helped you resolve the situation.

177
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,800
But what you were saying earlier.

178
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,709
Did you really go out with Yeong Gon?

179
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,310
Let me ask you this first.
How do you know him?

180
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,709
Well?

181
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,180
How do you think I know him?

182
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,019
By any chance,

183
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,490
is what happened today...

184
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,659
related to Jung?

185
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,190
Gosh, I was wondering what you'd say.

186
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,590
You, poor baby.

187
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,700
Are you that curious about it?

188
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,799
Then you should ask Jung directly.

189
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,899
Why do you have to ask me?

190
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,399
I see.
Is it because you're scared?

191
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,009
Are you scared of finding out
something you didn't know?

192
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,710
Please answer my question first.

193
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,649
To keep it short, my answer is no.

194
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
- Then...
- But what were you...

195
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,919
going to do if it was really something
Jung told me to do?

196
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,220
Were you going to break up with him, then?

197
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,690
Right, I hear you. It isn't easy
to break up with a good catch like him.

198
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,559
He's rich and handsome.
He's also from a good family.

199
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,799
Jung is the perfect boyfriend material
to brag about, indeed.

200
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,100
That's not why I'm with him.

201
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,700
Aren't you the one who is trying
to take advantage of him?

202
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,899
Me?

203
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm different.
Why?

204
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,009
It's because I understand Jung.

205
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,009
In other words, the mutual love
and understanding...

206
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,710
between us are what encourages
a lively give-and-take.

207
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,809
It's called mutual agreement.

208
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,179
Did you say that...

209
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,720
you understand Jung?

210
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,019
Look, the daughter of In Ho's boss.

211
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,519
There are two types of girls
who want to get close to Jung.

212
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,590
One who gets so scared
and runs far away...

213
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,929
or the other who forgets their place
and clings to him desperately.

214
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,429
I've never seen anyone like you,
so I'm quite confused.

215
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't know what to do,

216
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,470
so you're just trying
to test the water now.

217
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Well, you'll eventually give up
and get out of Jung's life anyway.

218
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,610
So if you don't think you can handle it,

219
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,210
just get out of his life now.

220
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,909
Don't cause trouble for Jung, okay?

221
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,779
Leave on your own before I make you leave.
Got it?

222
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,820
Right, I'm supposed to text Jung.

223
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,419
Right, I almost forgot.

224
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,490
My Jung.

225
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,190
My Jung.

226
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,460
Our product is on a par
with our biggest competitor's.

227
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,100
If our sales are lower than theirs,

228
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,700
it means that our marketing failed.

229
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,500
Based on what we discussed today,

230
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,470
come up with ideas
for promotions and events.

231
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,440
Each person has to come up with 10 ideas.
That's it for today.

232
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,110
That was a great meeting.

233
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:39,210
Well, it's lunchtime now.

234
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,809
How about we go to the pork bulgogi place?

235
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,679
Yes.
That sounds good.

236
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:44,220
Everyone, let's have lunch together.

237
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,419
- Yes, sure.
- Sure!

238
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,919
- Yes, let's go together.
- Let's go.

239
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,019
Jung, you have to organise
the meeting notes, right?

240
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,190
Gosh, aren't you being
too harsh on the intern?

241
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,490
Not at all.
Please don't worry.

242
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,700
The plan I asked you to work on.
You know it's due next week, right?

243
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,200
- Yes.
- I'll see you later.

244
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,799
Please wait for me!

245
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,110
(Marketing strategy targeting
university students in their 20s)

246
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,480
(Marketing Team: Assistant Manager,
Park Jung Soo)

247
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,789
Did you have lunch?

248
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,090
Yes.

249
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,809
Everything you're doing now
will affect your reputation later,

250
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,669
so you should be careful.

251
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,009
Remember that people are always watching.

252
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,120
Hey, you said
that you got fired from your job here.

253
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,250
Can you come in here?

254
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,289
I just lost my part-time job.

255
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,090
It doesn't mean
that I can't enter the library.

256
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,360
- Is that right?
- I can continue...

257
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,899
to help you study, so don't worry.

258
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,799
I'm not worried about that.

259
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,200
Then please study, okay?

260
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,299
You said that you have to
go for your practice later.

261
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,669
The mock test on Korean Literature
you took last time. You did...

262
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,710
Did you get 30 out of 100?
You know you did it horribly, right?

263
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,009
Keep it down.

264
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,750
All right.

265
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,850
Oasis Laundromat attack incident.
This one.

266
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,590
Solve these questions too.

267
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,120
How many pages are there in total?

268
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,720
All right.

269
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,389
I'll give you 20 minutes.

270
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,730
I'm going to check your answers
in 20 minutes.

271
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:40,029
Begin now.

272
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,730
Okay.

273
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,539
What is A in the passage referring to?

274
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,039
What does this sentence even mean?

275
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,350
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,289
Do you like Hong Seol?

277
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
She must've been tired.

278
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,950
Do I really like her?

279
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,029
(I'm going.
I couldn't finish it. Sorry.)

280
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,110
I'm going.

281
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,580
I couldn't finish it.
Sorry.

282
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,850
And go home if you're going to sleep.

283
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,250
I wish he woke me up.

284
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,860
Why is the word "sorry" missing one "r"?

285
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
It should be "sorry".

286
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,730
It's not "sory".

287
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,659
It's "sorry".

288
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,629
(Sorry)

289
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,740
He's showing his vulnerability.

290
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,200
I can feel a breeze of loneliness.

291
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Finally.

292
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,309
The Baek In Ho I used to know
is coming back.

293
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,049
I agreed to your proposal...

294
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,220
on the condition that...

295
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,419
you wouldn't show up in front of Seol.

296
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,029
But...

297
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,399
you caused a scene at my school.

298
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:34,570
You did it in front of
all of my classmates, not just Seol.

299
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,029
I wasn't going to show up in front of her.

300
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,639
Didn't you promise me that...
you'll take care of him quietly?

301
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,840
But Jung, listen to me, okay?

302
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,409
That stalker.

303
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,539
He asked me if we're dating.

304
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,350
He was determined to spread rumours
that you were cheating.

305
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,850
If we don't teach him a lesson now,

306
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,149
do you think Seol will stay with you?

307
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,850
You should be thanking me now.

308
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,149
Think about it again.
Plus,

309
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,960
I found out something else
while tailing after that stalker.

310
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,789
I was shadowing that stalker...

311
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,730
who always followed
your girlfriend around.

312
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,930
So obviously,
I kept seeing your girlfriend.

313
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,730
And I learned something
I didn't want to know in that process.

314
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,950
Jung, while you haven't been coming to
school often because of your internship,

315
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,549
In Ho has been hovering around
your girlfriend as if he was her bodyguard.

316
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,819
We need to get rid of that stalker soon
to stop In Ho from doing this.

317
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,019
Don't you agree?

318
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,160
Do you still think
that what I did today is wrong?

319
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:40,430
Let me show you this. You need to
understand how serious this is.

320
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:41,730
Gosh, seriously.

321
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,829
You keep getting angry at me
because you have no idea.

322
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,279
Baek In Ha, you're amazing.
A good tongue is a good weapon, indeed.

323
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,650
Gosh, my pretty baby!

324
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,049
Go in now! You belong to my wallet.

325
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,019
You don't know what to do, so...

326
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,289
you're just trying to test the water now.

327
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,160
Is that what I am doing?

328
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,829
Yes, I guess I am.

329
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,400
I can neither run away...

330
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,740
nor accept him.
I don't know what to do.

331
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,240
I'm confused like this,

332
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,640
but I still wish Jung was beside me
when I'm stressed out.

333
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,049
And I miss him.

334
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:33,849
What did you say?

335
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,549
You're not taking time off from school?
You actually quit?

336
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,519
You quit school?

337
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,819
- Gosh, you fool! You, idiot!
- Honey, please!

338
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,930
Gosh! Stop it, please!

339
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,390
- Are you in your right mind?
- That's enough.

340
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,230
- Let go of this!
- Goodness...

341
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,829
Go back to the States tomorrow.

342
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,029
Go back immediately...

343
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,740
and don't even dream about
coming back until you graduate!

344
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,039
I'm not going back there.

345
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,509
Do you think I don't study
because I don't want to?

346
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,750
I've tried my best, but I just can't.

347
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,549
I obviously know that we're bad off.

348
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,950
I had such a difficult time there.

349
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,450
- You, jerk! How dare you!
- Gosh, please stop it.

350
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,359
Hitting him won't solve any problem.

351
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,019
He didn't want to go there to begin with.

352
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,529
You're the one who forced him
to go to school there!

353
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,730
He has to graduate at least!

354
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,599
- Please...
- Listen.

355
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,630
Find out if it's possible
to be readmitted to your school.

356
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,569
If it isn't, find out
where you can transfer to.

357
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,099
Don't worry about the tuition fees.

358
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,839
I'll make Seol take time off
from school if I have to.

359
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,440
What are you talking about now?

360
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,740
He doesn't want to go back.

361
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,680
And what did Seol do wrong?

362
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,150
I'm not done talking yet.

363
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,150
Stop complaining.

364
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Joon.

365
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,349
Get ready to go back to the States.

366
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,519
Why?

367
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,089
Why do I have to take time off
from school because of Joon?

368
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:51,700
Seol.

369
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,029
Seol.

370
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,930
- Well...
- I moved back here last semester...

371
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,539
to help you pay Joon's tuition fees.

372
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,240
I commute for four hours a day
to go to school.

373
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,269
With my part-time job and my scholarship,

374
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,480
I've been paying my own tuition fees.

375
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
But now,

376
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:09,950
you want me to take time off from school

377
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,450
to support Joon?

378
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,319
Well, it could...

379
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,349
hurt your feelings a bit now,

380
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,119
but let's think about the future.

381
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,660
You'll get married, and that will be it,

382
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,589
but Joon will need to
take care of our family, right?

383
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,599
Am I not...

384
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,730
one of your children?

385
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,029
Will I be a stranger to you
after I get married?

386
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,140
You're being rude to me now.

387
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,740
I work part-time...
to make money for my tuitions.

388
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,940
I worry about not getting
good enough marks for the scholarship.

389
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,710
My head hurts every single day
from always worrying about money!

390
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,349
I work so hard,

391
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,950
but no matter how hard I work,

392
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,349
you've never been satisfied with
anything I've done.

393
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,119
You've never given me any compliments.

394
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,589
You know what?

395
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,660
I want to be complimented too.

396
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I want to be consoled too.
I'm not any different.

397
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Seol, calm down.

398
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,640
We know how hard you work, of course.

399
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,839
Mum, you're the same.

400
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,809
You dump all the pressure on me...

401
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,240
and complain to me all the time.

402
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,049
How can you expect me
to handle everything?

403
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,450
I do that to you because...

404
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,549
you're more dependable than Joon.

405
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:19,619
Then what about me?

406
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,490
Whom can I depend on?

407
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,029
I knew that this would happen.

408
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,640
How many times...

409
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,839
did I tell you not to
treat our kids that way?

410
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,710
You didn't do anything right either.

411
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,140
Think about why I had to
do the things that I did.

412
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,650
Listen. You were always busy
with that failing business of yours,

413
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,950
so you spent all of your time outside
and ignored my restaurant!

414
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,380
Since my business went under,

415
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,119
do you think I've ever been able
to relax at all?

416
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,420
I'm doing all this for our family.

417
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,490
You should be consoling me.

418
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,319
- Why do you all disrespect me?
- You're the one who disrespects me!

419
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,829
Are you that embarrassed
of our noodle restaurant?

420
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,930
You do everything halfheartedly.

421
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,099
I'm so sick of it!

422
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:08,470
Gosh, my heart...

423
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,569
I...

424
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
That's right.
I...

425
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,339
Goodness. What good
would talking to you do? It's useless!

426
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,210
I'm so frustrated!

427
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,809
Goodness...

428
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,049
In Ho!

429
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,819
Joon, where are you going?

430
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,730
In Ho.
Have you seen Seol by any chance?

431
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,390
No, I haven't.
Why?

432
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,029
Seol left home.

433
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,630
What are you talking about?
Why would she leave home?

434
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,940
She ran out after having a fight
with my dad.

435
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,170
She's not answering her phone,
and she's not at the restaurant either.

436
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,240
Gosh, it's all my fault.

437
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,140
When did she leave?
How long has it been?

438
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,339
I'm not sure.
About 10 minutes?

439
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,349
I'm sure she's still nearby.
Look for her.

440
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,349
Call me if you find her.
Got it?

441
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,750
The number you have dialled
cannot be reached...

442
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:10,190
Are you still in your adolescence?

443
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,099
Goodness.

444
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,440
Where...Where are you?
What are you doing now?

445
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,440
Hi, Seol.
Me?

446
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,579
I'm out with my dad for dinner.

447
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,349
Why?
Did something happen?

448
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,210
No.

449
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,650
I just wanted to see...

450
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,690
if you and Eun Taek would be up for...

451
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,950
fried chicken and beer.

452
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:39,819
I see.

453
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,190
We couldn't eat lunch
together today either.

454
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,329
Shall we meet later, then?

455
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
It's okay.

456
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,630
Have a good dinner with your dad.

457
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,829
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

458
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,039
Okay. We'll save fried chicken
and beer for another time.

459
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,410
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

460
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,140
Bye.

461
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,250
Nothing has changed.

462
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,549
I've been doing fine by myself.

463
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,160
But sometimes, I also...

464
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,230
I also wish...

465
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Seol.

466
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,490
Have you been doing well?

467
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,059
Goodness...

468
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,740
I missed you.

469
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:15,579
I missed you a lot.

470
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,619
I missed you too.

471
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,220
I missed you so much.

472
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,460
Your hands are so small.

473
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,319
There were so many things...

474
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,299
that I wanted to ask Jung when I meet him.

475
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,930
But the fact that he's right beside me
at this moment.

476
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,670
Being able to see his face...

477
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,240
and listen to his voice.

478
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,609
Being able to feel how warm his hand is.

479
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,950
These things are...

480
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,220
more than enough reasons...

481
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,150
that I can't break up with him.

482
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,319
(Mum)

483
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,230
Your parents must be worried about you.

484
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,930
I'll drive you home.

485
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,730
No.

486
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,029
Right now,

487
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,640
I don't feel like going home.

488
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,740
Could we stay here for a little longer?

489
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:53,539
Okay.

490
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,509
Then let's go for a drive.

491
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,109
Okay.

492
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,230
I'll open this for you.

493
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,839
- I'll just eat it myself.
- No.

494
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,539
How silly.

495
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,039
- Give it to me.
- Okay. I won't tease you any more.

496
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,750
Seriously!

497
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,819
Are you awake now?

498
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,390
Sorry?

499
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,299
Yes.

500
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,730
I guess you were really tired.

501
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,000
I couldn't sleep at all,

502
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,539
but you slept so soundly.

503
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,140
By any chance, did I snore...

504
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:35,549
I usually don't snore.
I guess I was really exhausted.

505
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,549
Your face must get puffy easily.

506
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,119
It's really puffy right now.

507
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,819
It's because
I ate that sausage last night.

508
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,130
Right.

509
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,430
Your phone kept buzzing all night.

510
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,569
Your family must be really worried.

511
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,009
Seol, where are you now?

512
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,009
Why are you not answering your phone?

513
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,579
Come home first.

514
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,380
So you're staying
at Bo Ra's place tonight.

515
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,049
You'll come home tomorrow, right?

516
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,519
I asked Bo Ra to give your parents a call,

517
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:20,720
so don't worry.

518
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,630
Okay.

519
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,930
You have no classes today, right?

520
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,430
That's right.

521
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,509
- Goodness!
- You tossed and turned all night.

522
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,740
I didn't get any sleep.

523
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,640
I called in that I'd be an hour late.

524
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,839
Let's get some more sleep.

525
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,579
Okay, but wait.
Hold on a second.

526
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,019
I'm going to fall asleep like this
so that you can't run away.

527
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,750
Jung, hold on.

528
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,849
Just for a bit.

529
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,720
Just for a little bit.

530
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,240
Can we talk like before now?

531
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,490
Can I see you like before?

532
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,059
Thanks.

533
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,259
After my very brief runaway,

534
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:36,589
I returned home.

535
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,329
I'm home.

536
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,470
Hong Seol!

537
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:44,730
You're crazy.
You're out of your mind.

538
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,839
How can you not come home overnight?
What were you thinking?

539
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,039
- My mum hit me on the back nonstop.
- Gosh, Mum. Wait.

540
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:51,339
Goodness, I'm so angry.

541
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,579
Gosh, it hurts.

542
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,009
You're home.

543
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,650
My dad was...

544
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,750
Go and get some rest.

545
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,650
He was quiet,

546
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,950
but he didn't really seem angry.

547
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,049
Goodness, seriously.

548
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:06,619
Seol, I'm happy that you're back.

549
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,029
Come and have a seat.

550
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,430
Seol, I'm sorry about yesterday.

551
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,829
- Joon tried to make me feel better.
- Gosh, I'm really sorry.

552
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,039
Seol, just punch me.
You should punch me like this.

553
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,740
If you know that you're in the wrong,

554
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,309
you should be better to Mum and Dad.

555
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,039
Yes, of course.

556
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't worry.

557
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,849
Mum and Dad were...

558
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,119
really worried about you.

559
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,420
They didn't even open the restaurant yet.

560
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,420
Stop talking, Joon! Go and...
get ready to open the restaurant.

561
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,589
Okay.

562
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,630
I'll see you later.

563
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,500
And Seol.

564
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:51,869
You haven't eaten yet, right?

565
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,240
Mum, you should go to the restaurant.

566
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,640
I can make food for myself.

567
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,940
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,309
I was trying to call your friends
yesterday and...

569
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,450
realised that I didn't have any
of their numbers.

570
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,590
Have a seat.

571
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,619
Okay.

572
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,460
Don't ever do that again, okay?

573
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,829
If Bo Ra didn't call us
about you staying with her,

574
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,400
we were going to report you
missing to the police.

575
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm sorry too.

576
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,579
You're going out again?

577
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,219
Eat, Seol.

578
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,960
Did you two have a fight again
because of me?

579
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,030
No, don't worry.

580
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,940
How can he not care
about the restaurant at all...

581
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,739
and keep going out like that?

582
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,039
Should I tell him to find another job?

583
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,309
I don't want to talk about it any more.
I'm so tired of nagging.

584
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,610
Take the spoon from there.

585
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:14,849
Hey, Joon.

586
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:16,849
In Ho.

587
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:18,650
Why are you here so early?

588
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,519
Didn't my mum tell you
to start later today?

589
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,329
- Did Seol come home?
- Yes. A little while ago.

590
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,199
She was at Bo Ra's place.

591
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,829
- I'm glad that she's back.
- Did you not go home last night?

592
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,039
Hold on.
Were you looking for Seol until now?

593
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,139
No.

594
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,610
I'm going now.

595
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,610
Where are you going?
Come in!

596
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,840
I have something to do.

597
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,599
So after that,
they stayed together overnight.

598
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,039
What are you doing?
You should be distributing the flyers.

599
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:14,579
Good morning.

600
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,110
Why are you so spaced out today?
Get to work.

601
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,579
The photo.

602
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,550
What is this photo, seriously?
Look at this.

603
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,960
This is such a horrible photo.
I look like an idiot.

604
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,719
I refuse to distribute these flyers.

605
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,030
What's wrong with this?
You look great in it.

606
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,630
You look much better when you smile.

607
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,800
Whatever.
Take another photo.

608
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,530
You were the one
who came up with this idea.

609
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,469
Shut it and just distribute these.

610
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,099
I clearly paid you for modelling,

611
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,309
so I have the right
to use this photo for these flyers.

612
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:45,940
You bought me
a bowl of jajangmyeon for it.

613
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,139
I clearly told you to order tangsuyuk.

614
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,150
You were going to hit me
if I actually ordered it.

615
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,949
- Who? Me?
- Yes!

616
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,449
Okay, okay.
Fine.

617
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,050
All right.
If you distribute all of these,

618
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,019
I'll buy you tangsuyuk.
You're a handful.

619
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,630
- You're serious, right?
- Do you have trust issues?

620
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,630
Yes! Order your tangsuyuk.
I won't hit you.

621
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,730
It's a deal.

622
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,829
By the way, what is that?

623
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,699
Get back to work now!

624
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:12,800
Gosh, seriously.

625
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,369
Hello!

626
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,440
Our noodles are really delicious.

627
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,309
(This handsome guy is in love
with Hong Noodles too!)

628
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:20,579
I look like a total idiot.

629
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,039
Hello.
Please visit...

630
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,150
Hello.
Come and try our noodles.

631
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,949
Hello.
Please visit Hong Noodles.

632
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,250
Hello.
Please visit Hong Noodles.

633
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Thank you.

634
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,519
My mum hit me.

635
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,099
You deserve it.

636
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,829
Whatever.
You're an accomplice.

637
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,739
Oh?
You're right.

638
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,739
Shall I confess to your parents...
that you stayed with me last night?

639
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,840
No.
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,849
How's work going?

641
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,949
I can't believe you have to work
on the weekend.

642
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:02,849
How are you feeling?

643
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,320
- Here.
- Thank you.

644
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,719
I'm sorry for being late today.

645
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,030
The report is almost done.

646
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,130
If you can double-check it, I will...

647
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,500
Gosh.
Don't even worry, okay?

648
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,230
I'm sure you did a great job.

649
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,539
All right.

650
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,039
By the way,

651
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,380
how's the plan for the internal contest...
coming along?

652
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,750
The deadline is around the corner.

653
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,949
I was doing some extra research...

654
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,750
and came up with additional ideas,

655
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,650
so I want to include them in the plan.

656
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,019
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

657
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:41,219
Great.
You never disappoint me, Jung.

658
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,530
You're such a fast learner.

659
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,460
It'd be amazing
if everyone could be just like you.

660
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,400
Cheater Girl, answer it.
Answer your phone.

661
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,840
Answer the call.

662
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:54,539
Okay.
You're not going to answer it?

663
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,239
I'm going to call you until you answer.

664
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,739
Let's see who wins, okay?

665
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:00,010
You picked the wrong person.

666
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,480
How dare you do this to my face.

667
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,320
Answer your phone!

668
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,150
- The number you have dialled...
- Goodness.

669
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,619
Darn it.

670
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,230
I'll write about
everything I know so that...

671
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,960
What are all these now?

672
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,000
Do these idiots sit
and post these things all day?

673
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,570
All of my posts have been pushed down!

674
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,070
This...
What's this?

675
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,469
What is this?

676
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,510
This is me stalking Seol at the library.

677
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,380
This is...

678
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:38,650
This is me following Seol before my class.

679
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,150
What kind of jerk did this?

680
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:46,590
- What's this now?
- He's taking a photo of her legs.

681
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,389
Is that pervert stalking the girl
in the photo? That's a crime.

682
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,090
Reveal his face.
I need to see that jerk's face.

683
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,559
Yeong Gon is insane.

684
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,699
Why does he even live?

685
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,730
You don't even deserve to eat.
Starve yourself to death.

686
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,030
Have they gone collectively crazy?

687
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,739
That's not me.

688
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:04,940
Don't you dare frame me, you jerk.

689
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,239
Whoever it is,

690
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,550
I'll report you to the police...

691
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,949
and make you get locked up for...

692
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,480
circulating false information.

693
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,159
(Haven't you been circulating
false information through your posts?)

694
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,590
Wait.

695
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,829
This comment.
By any chance, could this be Jung?

696
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,130
No.

697
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
No way.

698
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,530
No. He hasn't even been coming
to school due to his internship.

699
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,840
Who did this?

700
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,210
What kind of jerk did this?

701
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,510
No one will recognise me
from those photos, right?

702
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:49,320
Yes. The chance of my classmates
seeing that post is slim.

703
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:51,449
Even if they do, my face isn't really
recognisable in the photos.

704
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,460
Goodness! You startled me!

705
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,519
Hey!

706
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,960
Look at you.
It looks like what I heard is true.

707
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,630
I heard that you got beaten up...

708
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,230
by Da Young and a random hot girl.

709
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,940
I'm jealous, Yeong Gon.
Girls just love you, don't they?

710
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,940
You're not like me,
who has no money or connections.

711
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,369
Well, there is a misunderstanding.

712
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,739
Hey.
By the way,

713
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,650
did someone take photos of you?

714
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,550
What are you talking about?

715
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:22,650
Well, someone posted photos
of a crazy stalker on this website.

716
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:24,650
I keep looking at the photos...

717
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,519
and can't stop thinking
that he looks like you from behind.

718
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,489
Hey, have a look.
Isn't this you?

719
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,929
What are you talking about?
That's not me.

720
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,030
How can you tell who it is from behind?

721
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:39,239
Do you think I'm crazy enough
to do something like that?

722
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,039
Goodness.
I'm just speechless.

723
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:43,309
Sang Cheol. Why are you
wasting your time on that site...

724
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,840
when you're in your fourth year?

725
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,309
Goodness.
I'm not in a good mood these days,

726
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,349
so don't provoke me.
Leave me alone, please.

727
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,510
Just go away.

728
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,519
- He really looks like Yeong Gon.
- Gosh, that annoying idiot.

729
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,750
He should mind his own business.

730
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,250
- Goodness...
- They're identical.

731
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,050
His waist and hips.

732
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,519
- Even his bag is the same.
- Who took those photos?

733
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,960
- His broad shoulders.
- Jung?

734
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,130
- The back of his head.
- No. He hasn't come to school.

735
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,300
- He's running away from me.
- Baek In Ha?

736
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,230
No. She's dumb.
She's not calculative.

737
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:10,369
Look at him now.

738
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,940
Get lost, you jerk!

739
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Let me teach you a lesson.

740
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,409
- The way he's standing now.
- That punk.

741
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,539
He looks just like this guy.

742
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,510
That's right.

743
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,480
It must be that punk!

744
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,849
Goodness.
Is it you again?

745
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,449
I'm going to teach you a hard lesson.

746
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,320
Go away! Go! Go!

747
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,119
Yes, hello?
Yes.

748
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,730
- Hey.
- Let's go. This isn't a good spot.

749
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:38,960
I came out to get fresh air though.

750
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,829
- Let's go now.
- Okay, 1, 2, 3.

751
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,030
Where are you taking me?

752
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,030
Just come with us.

753
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,340
Yes.
Right.

754
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,840
- Why? Where are we going now?
- Gosh, just come with us.

755
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:51,639
- You're so dead.
- You're hungry, right?

756
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,639
- Yes.
- Let's go and get food.

757
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:55,579
Hold on.

758
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,050
It looks like that punk is...
posting things about me on the internet.

759
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,519
Tell him to stop it immediately.

760
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,650
Otherwise, I'll sue him.

761
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,150
Gosh, that jerk.

762
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,119
That piece of trash isn't even recyclable.

763
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,619
Goodness, that rat.

764
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,489
How dare they.

765
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,389
Seol.
What happened the other day, by the way?

766
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,960
Your boyfriend, Jung,

767
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,530
called me out of the blue,

768
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,530
so I was so surprised.

769
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,030
And do you know how nervous I was
when I called your parents?

770
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,539
I was scared that they might
want to speak to you.

771
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,570
I'm sorry.

772
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,510
What happened?

773
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,380
Were you really with Jung?

774
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,349
Well, yes.
It just happened that way.

775
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:32,210
Did you sleep on the same bed?

776
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,750
What?
Did you and Jung really...

777
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,550
Gosh, no!

778
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,659
Not at all.
We just slept.

779
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,730
- You've become tainted.
- Seol, my Seol...

780
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,530
What are you talking about now?

781
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,130
We really just slept.

782
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,329
Did you two really just sleep?

783
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:49,030
Yes! What else would we do?

784
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,199
If that's the case,
Jung should go and see a doctor.

785
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,840
- Why?
- It means that he has a problem.

786
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,510
Don't look at me.

787
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:00,010
- I don't know anything.
- You could hold hands.

788
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,909
You would hug after that, right?
Then...

789
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,150
You made it.

790
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,949
Yes.
Let's study.

791
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,719
Why are you sitting there?
Sit here.

792
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,130
What?

793
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,409
What are you doing now?

794
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,909
We have to go through
the questions together.

795
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,510
Can you see anything from there?

796
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,250
I can see them.

797
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,389
Is it because you didn't do the homework?
It's okay.

798
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,130
I'll forgive you, so come and...

799
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,590
Goodness.

800
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,400
If you don't want to study,
just forget it.

801
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:34,300
I won't tutor you any more then.

802
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,139
You're not ready to study.
Forget it.

803
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,239
I'm a busy person.

804
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,550
Hey.

805
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:52,349
What are you doing, seriously?

806
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,730
Did you not do a lot of it?

807
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,369
All right, let's see.

808
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,510
The third question is...
It's not an easy one.

809
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,449
The question is asking you to choose...

810
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,519
what is irrelevant to the reactions
of A and E.

811
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,050
This is the correct answer.

812
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,199
What?

813
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,099
Are you with me?

814
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,369
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

815
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,840
What's wrong with you today?

816
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,340
You're totally spaced out.

817
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,579
Well, I didn't get
a good sleep last night.

818
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,480
You have to concentrate when you study.

819
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,119
That way, you can pick up things quickly.

820
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,449
The correct answer
for the first question is...

821
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,590
Let's stop here today.

822
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,059
I'll get going now.

823
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,630
Wait. At this rate, we'll never
even get through this chapter.

824
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,829
You don't have that much time.

825
00:47:06,929 --> 00:47:08,300
You have to take this at least.

826
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:16,639
He's too much.

827
00:47:20,809 --> 00:47:22,110
Judging from how Joon...

828
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:24,750
lied to my whole family and quit school,

829
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,420
it must've been really difficult for him.

830
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,219
He always jokes and acts silly,

831
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,949
so I didn't know what he was thinking.

832
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,630
He acts silly, but he's pretty thoughtful.

833
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,659
Even that day, he went all over
the neighbourhood looking for you...

834
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,429
That's what I heard.

835
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,030
He told me.

836
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
I see.

837
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,579
Are you a teenage girl?

838
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,380
Why did you run away from home?
You're old enough.

839
00:47:57,449 --> 00:47:58,449
Goodness.

840
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,750
Let me give you a piece of advice
as a former runaway kid.

841
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:02,650
Don't do such a stupid thing.
It's not fun.

842
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,650
I see.

843
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,119
You just sounded very mature.

844
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,090
Listen.
I'm older than you.

845
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,599
- Really?
- Yes!

846
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,030
But...

847
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,230
you never show me any respect.

848
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,699
You're so casual with me.

849
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:22,570
Then...

850
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,639
Shall I call you Mr. Baek In Ho?

851
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:27,309
What?

852
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,050
That's worse.

853
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,550
Just forget it. Don't call me that.
I never asked you to do that.

854
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:38,849
That was ridiculous.

855
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,119
Then how about Cutie Pie?

856
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,829
Cutie Pie! Cutie Pie.

857
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,730
What do you think?
It suits you! Cutie Pie!

858
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,630
Mad Hair.

859
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,929
Shall we go somewhere together?

860
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:55,639
- Where?
- You'll find out. Just follow me.

861
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,739
And don't call me Cutie Pie.

862
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,309
Get ready.
We're getting off next.

863
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,510
Okay.

864
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:07,650
How can she call me that?

865
00:49:09,019 --> 00:49:10,949
Gosh, where are we going now?

866
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,059
Stop asking and just follow me.

867
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:19,699
Gosh, Cutie Pie.
In Ho.

868
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,130
Where are you taking me now?

869
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,630
Stop calling me Cutie Pie, okay?

870
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:25,329
What kind of prank is this about?

871
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,940
- Come on. I'm not playing a prank.
- Okay.

872
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:30,210
Yes, hello. Hello.
Please visit Hong Noodles.

873
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,239
Please visit us
and taste our delicious noodles.

874
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,940
Hello, please visit Hong Noodles.
Here you go.

875
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,639
Eat our delicious noodles.
This handsome guy is there too.

876
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,050
- He's one of our servers.
- Dad?

877
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,650
Please visit us.
Thank you!

878
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,849
Yes, hello.
Please visit Hong Noodles.

879
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:43,150
- I only recently found out too.
- Please visit Hong Noodles.

880
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:44,650
It looks like he's been doing
this by himself.

881
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,849
Yes, thank you!

882
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,019
Hello.

883
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,619
- It's very delicious.
- Then...

884
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:49,730
Yes, thank you.

885
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:53,530
He must've been stepping out
of the restaurant because of this.

886
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:55,429
Our noodles are so delicious.

887
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:56,730
This handsome guy is our server.

888
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:58,530
I really had no idea.

889
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,940
Hello, please visit Hong Noodles.

890
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,840
- About Dad. Joon too.
- Please visit Hong Noodles.

891
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,210
Hello, please visit Hong Noodles.

892
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:05,309
Yes, thank you!

893
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,940
I thought I was the only one
having a rough time.

894
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,539
Our noodles are very delicious.
Come and try them. Thank you!

895
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,550
Mr. Hong told me to keep it to myself.

896
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,750
Our noodles are the best.

897
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:15,150
It's all your fault if he finds out.

898
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,849
Yes, hello.
Please visit Hong Noodles.

899
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,719
Hello, please visit Hong Noodles.

900
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,920
Yes, hello.
Please visit our...

901
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:23,929
Yes, thank you.

902
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,789
Why did we come all the way here?

903
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:27,400
There are many restaurants
near our place too.

904
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:29,699
I have to go and prepare
for the dinner rush.

905
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,400
Seol is treating us.
Let's just go, okay?

906
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:32,929
- Yes, let's go.
- Let's go for beef barbecue.

907
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,840
Shut it.
And you.

908
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,440
Are you trying to be a good daughter
after running away like that?

909
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:40,110
Gosh, let go of me.
I'm going to go back to work, okay?

910
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:42,809
- Gosh, Mum. Come on.
- Please visit Hong Noodles.

911
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,210
You two are too much.

912
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,550
- Please visit us.
- Gosh, let me go.

913
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:47,119
- What?
- Hello.

914
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,150
Am I seeing Dad and In Ho over there?

915
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,489
A good-looking guy works there
as a server.

916
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,650
You're right.

917
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,820
Dad!

918
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:56,929
Goodness! Don't you know this guy?

919
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,190
What are you two doing here now?

920
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:00,360
What is this?
Is this a flyer?

921
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:02,559
I helped him a little.

922
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,730
But Mr. Hong took such a bad photo of me.

923
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,739
What's this? "This handsome guy
is in love with Hong Noodles too."

924
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,239
Why are you doing things
I didn't even tell you to do?

925
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,539
It's cold today. You should dress
for the weather at least!

926
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,409
All of our neighbours walk through here.
You're embarrassing me.

927
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,820
You're making me look like a bad wife!

928
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:22,849
Whether I do something or not,
you always yell at me!

929
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,090
The restaurant has gotten busy lately.

930
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,289
It's all because of my hard work.

931
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,559
- Wear this.
- I don't need it!

932
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,360
You're so stubborn.

933
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,929
Listen to me for once, okay?

934
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,429
You never listen to me.
Goodness.

935
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,610
By the way, how did you know
that I was here?

936
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,940
How?

937
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,510
Did you tell them?

938
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,809
I told you not to tell anyone!

939
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,610
Is this a crime?
Why do you want to hide it?

940
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,219
No, Seol wanted to...

941
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,219
take us out for dinner to make up
for not coming home the other night.

942
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,059
Everyone, let's go for dinner.

943
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,489
What? You have to get ready
for the dinner crowd.

944
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,530
Why are all of you wasting your time
like this?

945
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,630
- Go back to the restaurant now!
- Gosh, let your daughter treat you.

946
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,829
Go. Go now.
I'll take care of this.

947
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,030
Go and have dinner.

948
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,130
- Take him now.
- Aren't you coming with us?

949
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,239
It's your family dinner.

950
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:17,369
- Everyone, leave now.
- Don't act like a stranger.

951
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,139
- Come with us.
- All right! Let's take a break.

952
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,739
Let's go and eat first.
Come with us.

953
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,909
- Come on!
- Bring the flyers.

954
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,949
- Don't forget the flyers.
- Hurry!

955
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,679
- In Ho, let's go.
- Okay.

956
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:36,019
- Let me see...
- Seol, this place looks expensive.

957
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,130
No, don't worry.

958
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,590
What should we order?

959
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:40,130
- Beef barbecue.
- Shut it.

960
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,030
It's your sister's hard-earned money.

961
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,000
Switch seats with me.

962
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,530
- Why?
- Why?

963
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,380
Well... He's ambidextrous,
but he eats with his left hand.

964
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,340
- Aren't I right?
- Yes.

965
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,050
In Ho, you're ambidextrous?
That means you're a genius.

966
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:01,949
I see.
That's why he ate noodles with his...

967
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,519
Then do you use your left hand
for writing too?

968
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,320
Yes.
I was born like this.

969
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:09,320
Do you play the piano
with your left hand too?

970
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,829
I have to use both hands for that.
You're an idiot.

971
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,030
- Are you really an idiot?
- Gosh...

972
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,130
- He's so dumb.
- In Ho.

973
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,429
This will replace the tangsuyuk.

974
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,929
What are you talking about, Mr. Hong?
Why?

975
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,400
You're getting this instead.

976
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,940
Samgyeopsal for four people, please.

977
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,139
- Sure.
- You're unethical.

978
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,739
Yes, I'm an unethical man.

979
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,840
- Sorry, we'll order five portions.
- No.

980
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,449
Please give us four portions
and five bowls of rice.

981
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,949
- One order of flap meat too!
- Sure.

982
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,050
Please cancel the last one!

983
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,119
All right.

984
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,829
You must be tired from practising
the piano while working part-time.

985
00:53:45,929 --> 00:53:47,130
Eat up.

986
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,730
Yes, In Ho.
You should eat a lot.

987
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,329
He's going through a rough time
studying my books from high school.

988
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,940
Hey! Stop it now.

989
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,469
- Why?
- He'll take the qualification exam.

990
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:58,909
Isn't that an exam for...

991
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,239
people who didn't graduate
from middle school or high school?

992
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,409
Yes, well...

993
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,349
I dropped out of high school.
I'm preparing for the exam now.

994
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:07,449
I didn't know.

995
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,380
- I'm impressed.
- You're actually studying?

996
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,619
Of course.

997
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:12,449
You should eat a lot.

998
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,420
It's never too late to study.

999
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,420
Seol.
You should help him.

1000
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,530
- I'm already helping him study.
- Great.

1001
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,530
Stop slacking off and study hard, okay?

1002
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,329
When did I slack off?

1003
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,530
You're really studying?

1004
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,300
Here, eat this.
This will replace the tangsuyuk.

1005
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,440
Goodness, I can't believe you.

1006
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:33,539
Fine.
Say whatever you want.

1007
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,440
Think of this as tangsuyuk and enjoy it.

1008
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:37,650
I'm going to report you
to the labour board.

1009
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,750
Sure, go ahead.

1010
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:42,050
- Where's mine, Dad?
- Yours?

1011
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,849
Tell me.
What are you going to do from now on?

1012
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,119
How will you earn a living?

1013
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:49,119
I'm not sure if I'll ever get
to eat barbecue you buy for me.

1014
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,030
Dad, we're here to enjoy the barbecue.

1015
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,730
Here.
Pour me some, then.

1016
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,030
Stop.
That's enough.

1017
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,719
Last time, it sounded so lonely and cold.

1018
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,090
But today, it reminds me
of a bright, sunny day.

1019
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:27,829
Does it?

1020
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:30,300
What's the reason
behind your mood swings these days?

1021
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,539
You're happy to hear that, aren't you?

1022
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,139
You're really like Beethoven.

1023
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,340
Are you still uncomfortable
with Professor Noh?

1024
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,809
You'll go and see him though, right?

1025
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,980
- No.
- Why not?

1026
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,250
I just...

1027
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:54,420
I don't feel confident yet.

1028
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,960
Let's go and have lunch.

1029
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,360
- What about the lesson?
- It's finished.

1030
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,099
I'm hungry.
It's on me, so let's go.

1031
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,539
What's wrong with him today?

1032
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,340
In the next class,

1033
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:15,409
we'll go over the concepts of profit
dividend and stock dividend.

1034
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:17,510
- Thank you for the great class!
- Thank you!

1035
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,250
- Seol! Seol!
- Seol!

1036
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:25,349
Seol! Seol!

1037
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,960
- Yes?
- Let's go for lunch.

1038
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,920
- Sure!
- What shall we eat?

1039
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,130
Do you feel like anything specific?

1040
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,730
Well...
It's cold, so how about we go for udon?

1041
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:35,130
- Udon?
- Udon noodles.

1042
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,530
Where are you now?
I'm at school right now.

1043
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,139
Let's have lunch together.

1044
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,300
- You like udon too, right?
- Yes.

1045
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,610
Well, if that's the case...

1046
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:46,639
- What are you doing?
- I'll see you guys later.

1047
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:47,739
Aren't you coming with us?

1048
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,440
Jung is here now.

1049
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,710
Enjoy your lunch!

1050
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,250
Seol! Are you really leaving us?

1051
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,550
We came all the way here for her.

1052
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:56,050
She's totally fallen for him.

1053
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,150
Are you jealous?

1054
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,260
But that's normal.

1055
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,989
Until when am I going to stay
as your servant?

1056
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,630
What are you talking about now?

1057
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:05,329
Bo Ra.

1058
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,030
Do you really want me to...

1059
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,630
stay as your servant forever?

1060
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,630
What's wrong with you?

1061
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:13,639
Don't forget that I'm older than you.

1062
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:15,840
Let's go and have lunch.

1063
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,710
- Are you not coming?
- Gosh. I'm coming.

1064
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,949
I see him! Jung!

1065
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,730
Why are you so happy?

1066
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:39,889
I thought you'd be by the lake.

1067
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,130
Can you leave work
during the day like this?

1068
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Why not?

1069
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:45,570
No one can stop me when I want to see you.

1070
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:48,840
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

1071
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,769
- Shall we go to the cafeteria?
- Yes!

1072
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:58,949
Let's go!

1073
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:14,630
Sitting here with you is...

1074
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,429
reminding me of the day
that you left me for a blind date.

1075
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,739
That was such a long time ago.

1076
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,139
- Thanks for getting this.
- No problem.

1077
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,110
How's the internship going?
Is it a lot of work?

1078
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,510
It's keeping me busy, and it's tiring.
It's okay though.

1079
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,449
What about you?
Is everything okay at school?

1080
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,719
Actually, these days...

1081
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,559
I almost told him about Yeong Gon.

1082
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,219
Everything is fine, of course.

1083
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:47,659
I guess I should tell him at some point,

1084
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,130
but it doesn't have to be today
as he hasn't been to school in a while.

1085
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,369
How's studying going?

1086
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,639
Well, it's going.

1087
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,409
I should tell him about
helping In Ho with his preparation...

1088
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,139
for the qualification exam, right?

1089
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,050
It's not about anything else.
I'm just helping him study.

1090
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,519
Jung, actually...

1091
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,750
You make lots of money.
Did you have to bring me here?

1092
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:11,849
What's wrong with this cafeteria?

1093
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,659
The food here is cheap and delicious.
I'm...

1094
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,820
It's you!

1095
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,929
- Hello, Professor Noh.
- Yes, hello.

1096
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,000
You're the one
whom I gave my business card to.

1097
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,530
- Yes.
- It's good to see you again.

1098
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,730
Let's sit here.

1099
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:33,909
Why are you sitting there?

1100
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,710
I want to enjoy my lunch.

1101
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,650
What does that mean?

1102
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,780
Why did I have to
give my business card that day...

1103
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,550
and get myself into this?

1104
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,150
I feel the same way, okay?

1105
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,619
By the way, did you thank her yet?

1106
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,130
Thank you very much.

1107
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,429
Thanks to you, I got to take his lessons
which I'm enjoying a lot.

1108
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,530
Gosh, this fool.

1109
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,230
He should've studied
and entered this university properly.

1110
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,929
I'm realising that studying
isn't that difficult.

1111
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,199
Don't you agree, Mad Hair?

1112
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,440
I'm very good at studying, aren't...

1113
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,639
I haven't told Jung about...

1114
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:08,940
helping you with studying.

1115
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,039
Are you okay?

1116
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,650
- Are you okay?
- Please don't worry.

1117
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:15,849
What's wrong with her?

1118
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,730
By the way, are you also In Ho's friend?

1119
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:26,429
No!

1120
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:28,929
Yes.

1121
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,130
I'm Yu Jung. I'm a fourth-year student
in Business Administration.

1122
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,300
I see. You're studying
Business Administration. That's great.

1123
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:35,940
Is In Ho practising...

1124
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:37,940
- the piano hard these days?
- Yes.

1125
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:40,039
Why do you even care, you jerk?
Just eat your lunch!

1126
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,010
Look at you with your nasty temper.

1127
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,050
This foul temper of his frustrated me
at the beginning,

1128
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:51,150
but the sounds are charged
with emotions these days.

1129
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:53,349
- I used to be like that.
- That's not true.

1130
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:56,789
Are you seeing someone these days?

1131
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:58,659
Gosh, look at this mess.

1132
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,929
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

1133
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,329
The sounds have definitely changed.

1134
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,730
My instinct is telling me that.

1135
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,039
- you must have a girlfriend.
- Pardon me?

1136
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,710
- Please eat your lunch, okay?
- You didn't have to yell at me.

1137
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:39,030
Thanks.

1138
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,809
The two of you look so lovely together.

1139
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,809
I'm done now.

1140
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,010
I'm done too.

1141
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:53,750
Meet me at the cafe later.

1142
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:55,579
Sure.

1143
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,150
Yes, Joon.
What's up?

1144
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,219
Hi, In Ho. You know those big bowls
we use in our kitchen, right?

1145
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,420
Mum is wondering if you can pick them up
along with paper towels.

1146
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:06,460
Bowls and paper towels?
Okay.

1147
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,059
Hey, where did we buy
those bowls last time?

1148
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,329
Mad Hair.

1149
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:13,940
Ms Kim wants me to pick up bowls.
Where did we buy them last time?

1150
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:15,769
Don't go back to that place.

1151
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,539
Hey, Joon! Tell Mum.

1152
01:02:18,539 --> 01:02:22,440
I saw on TV that the store sold bowls
that had carcinogens.

1153
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,849
Tell her that we shouldn't buy anything
from that store, okay?

1154
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,179
You heard that, right?

1155
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,349
Those bowls will give people cancer.

1156
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:30,849
Tell Ms Kim.
I'll find other bowls...

1157
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,420
What?
The two of them went out together?

1158
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:35,820
When?
Were they in a good mood?

1159
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,260
That means they reconciled.

1160
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,199
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

1161
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,929
The two of them went out together?

1162
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,070
They went to an alumni gathering.

1163
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:48,369
The barbecue dinner must've helped.
Don't you think so?

1164
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,269
Did you hear that?
The two of them...

1165
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,739
You like that girl, right?
Tell us honestly.

1166
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,739
Do you know what his crush looks like?

1167
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,050
She looks like a vicious gorilla.

1168
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,949
Shouldn't you have higher standards
when you have such a pretty sister?

1169
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,150
- She's ugly.
- She's much prettier than you.

1170
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,650
She was caught
robbing her classmate today.

1171
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,550
- You're so childish.
- She's so much better than you.

1172
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:08,119
What did you say?
Mr. Yu, look how rude he is to me!

1173
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,320
Mr. Yu, she also fought today.

1174
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,530
I saw her beating someone up at school.

1175
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,230
- What happened?
- Let me explain.

1176
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,599
- She's in the same club as me...
- Don't lie.

1177
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,639
Jung, what's wrong?

1178
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:28,739
I'll see you later.

1179
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,949
Jung.

1180
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:32,949
What's wrong with him?

1181
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:38,420
I'll get going now too.

1182
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,829
She's following him around now.

1183
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:52,030
Jung!

1184
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,829
What's the matter?

1185
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,239
It looks like you and In Ho
have gotten very close.

1186
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,579
Well, that's just...

1187
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:13,849
I've been helping him study these days,

1188
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,320
and he works at the restaurant too...

1189
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:19,730
Jung, wait.

1190
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,599
I'm sorry.
I'll talk to you later.

1191
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,730
You can't even tell
when people are being fake.

1192
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:55,030
You're Yu Jung, right?

1193
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,730
Come out, you jerk!

1194
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,630
Jung knew everything?

1195
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,530
Could you be like him
if your girlfriend was...

1196
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:02,139
being stalked and harassed?

1197
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,340
No way! I'd run after him
and split his head in half!

1198
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,940
This isn't about Yeong Gon.

1199
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,309
It's about us.

1200
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,739
I was angry because of In Ho.

1201
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,409
That's why I didn't talk to you.

1202
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,250
That's the answer I want to hear.

1203
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:14,150
Do you think
I'm hiding something from you?

1204
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,250
You didn't do it, right?

1205
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,590
No.
You're the one who did it, not me.

1206
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:21,320
I made a deal with Jung, okay?

1207
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,519
Jung is the one
who made that stalker approach you.

1208
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,329
He's also the one
who wants that stalker gone now.

1209
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,730
Yu Jung, that jerk.

1210
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,230
Is that your way of
keeping Seol beside you?

1211
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,929
Why do you care?

1212
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,869
I care because I like her.
