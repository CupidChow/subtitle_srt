1
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,625
<i>What a wonderful life</i>

2
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>That my heart feels so real</i>

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,750
<i>Feeling joy deep inside </i>

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:25,583
<i>That I am still alive</i>

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:32,666
<i>Every day is a happy journey</i>

6
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>Just like the dream</i>

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,916
<i>I wished for </i>

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,875
<i>It's been gnawing away at me</i>
<i>for about a month now.</i>

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,875
<i>Tastes good, doesn't it?</i>

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,291
<i>When you reach a certain age,</i>

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,625
<i>it's natural to start wondering</i>
<i>how your life will end.</i>

12
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,083
<i>But no one ever imagines</i>
<i>they'll wind up as cat food.</i>

13
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:02,041
<i>How long does somebody have to be gone</i>
<i>before anyone realizes they're missing?</i>

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:06,666
<i>These past few months,</i>

15
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,250
<i>the only people still ringing</i>

16
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,875
<i>were call center scammers after my money.</i>

17
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:17,291
<i>Which is sadder?</i>

18
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,958
<i>Dying alone,</i>

19
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>or living a life where no one misses you?</i>

20
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,541
<i>But guess what?</i>

21
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,583
<i>Three years after I died,</i>

22
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,500
<i>then people started to miss me.</i>

23
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,750
<i>I am alive </i>

24
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,000
Pet.

25
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,041
Quit playing around. Let's get it done.

26
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,916
I'd like to be out there, not here.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,916
Oh, come on. You begged me for my help.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,666
Help, my ass.

29
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,416
I'm paying you.

30
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,250
Yeah, because it's outside of work hours.

31
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,500
Or do you want them to know
you can't do the job, just like Shane?

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,583
Just make sure
you don't say a word about this.

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,750
Oh, come on.

34
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,541
I do have professional ethics.

35
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,625
Anyway, Toh, you know,
this AI stuff is pretty straightforward.

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,083
It's just about getting the best results.

37
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:09,500
No connections.
No care for seniority either.

38
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,666
Yeah. Suits you perfectly, hey?

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,166
Someone who never wants friends
or older bosses messing up your life.

40
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,500
Friends, huh?

41
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,750
Wasn't it you who fired Shane?

42
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,666
What kind of friend does that?

43
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,416
You guys were probably too young.

44
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:34,458
But back in the day, this area,
there was nothing here.

45
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,375
Back then,

46
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,375
I'm not sure if you'd even
started shaving, boss.

47
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,166
Sir, you know,

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,083
my friend Toh and I,

49
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,250
we've been here since day one.

50
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:54,375
I wrote so many withdrawal slips,
I got cramps in my hand.

51
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:00,958
But now with these computers,
I'm not so fast.

52
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,833
These eyes are no good.

53
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,291
I've had to learn new software.

54
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,916
It takes more time.

55
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,666
AI.

56
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,500
It might think that I'm hopeless,

57
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,958
but it's just faster.

58
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,166
And now I'm the one
getting fired from here?

59
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,750
But the older customers,
ah, they wanted us.

60
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:39,208
And on New Year's Day,
I'd have all these presents everywhere.

61
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,416
All of that.

62
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,791
Does AI report that?

63
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,791
Does it see any of it?

64
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,875
Maybe it didn't know
I was staying late with work here.

65
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,000
But my friend…

66
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Why?!

67
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,416
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You saw me!

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,458
Hey, Shane. Shane, calm down.
Shane, calm down.

69
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,875
You had to stay late
because you were slow, that's why.

70
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
<i>I'm not drunk, Toh.</i>

71
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,708
I just wanted them to know how I feel.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,541
Thank you so much for the lovely send-off.

73
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,750
And now you're the last of us, Toh.

74
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,500
Sorry it was me who had to tell you.

75
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,541
Once it's in the system,
I didn't have a choice.

76
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,583
Hey, yeah, it's fine, it's fine. I get it.

77
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,958
It's your job.

78
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,708
But if one day your turn comes,

79
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:43,750
and those kids…

80
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,750
If they don't care about you either,
you tell me, okay?

81
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
Hey!

82
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,291
Can you pay for that damn screen for me?

83
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,041
My staff ID is the code.

84
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,333
Damn, tonight's gonna be rough.
Up to 3:00 or 4:00.

85
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,125
Oh, yeah!

86
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,625
That is tough.

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,958
Hi.

88
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,708
Don't come in yet, don't come in.

89
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,666
Here. Go outside for a sec.

90
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,625
What's that?

91
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,583
- Hey, just go outside.
- What?

92
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,250
Keep going.

93
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,583
- Here?
- Mm, not yet.

94
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,291
Go all the way out there,
then walk off to the right.

95
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,791
Yeah, keep going.

96
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,041
Yeah, go that way. Go further. More.

97
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,875
Keep going.

98
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:55,208
Okay, that's far enough.
Now walk back the other way.

99
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,833
Put this in our daughter's bag, okay?

100
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,208
We've got a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
Go straight there after work.

101
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,916
Oh, okay.

102
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,708
- Wait
- Hmm?

103
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,250
- Alcohol spray.
- Ah.

104
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,791
Here.

105
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,291
Yay.

106
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,750
The other side too. Okay.

107
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,083
Hmm.

108
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,708
Ready?

109
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,458
<i>This time,</i>
<i>I'll lie still for ten days, okay?</i>

110
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,750
Hi, can you introduce yourself?

111
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,000
My name is Snow. I am six years old.

112
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,875
Ah, six years old. Do you have a hobby?

113
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,375
Playing.

114
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,750
And what do you like to play?

115
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,250
I don't know.

116
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,791
That's fine.

117
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,541
Why do you want to study here?

118
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,166
Hmm…

119
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,333
Because my dad said so?

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
Ah, he made a very good choice.

121
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,833
Yes!

122
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,083
Ah.

123
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,750
Ah.

124
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,666
You can't add up scores from two lanes.

125
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,416
Okay, hang on a sec.

126
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,583
Whoo!

127
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,083
Okay, okay, okay.

128
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,250
There you go.

129
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,041
Oh, wow.

130
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,166
Your girl goes here to school?

131
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,125
Wow, that's damn fancy, hey?

132
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,000
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

133
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,958
Now that we're done, you can go, okay?

134
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,208
You're interrupting my personal time.

135
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,583
Come on, it's my personal time too.

136
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,958
Just because I ride a motorbike,
they're using me as a messenger.

137
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,333
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

138
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,083
For your continued support
of the school here,

139
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,583
I'd like to thank all the parents.

140
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,541
Thank you for your help.

141
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:35,208
In the latest all-school survey,
we're number one for quality.

142
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,250
Let's celebrate.

143
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,250
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Enjoy your night.

144
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,041
Okay.

145
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,125
- Hello, hello, how are you?
- Oh, hello, sir.

146
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,750
Are you having a good night?

147
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,083
Thank you. Thank you so much.

148
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,000
- Hey, Pet.
- Hmm?

149
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,500
Go find out for me
how much they're donating.

150
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Go on.

151
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,208
Hey. Get going. Go.

152
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,416
I'll pay you.

153
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,041
Mr. Tony.

154
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,916
Oh. Hi.

155
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,958
- Welcome.
- Hello.

156
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,875
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

157
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,708
- All right.
- How are you, Mr. J?

158
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,791
- Very good.
- Good.

159
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,041
I'd like to thank you and your wife.

160
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,833
Your help over this time
means much more than money.

161
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,875
Um, but keep giving.

162
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,333
About Snow.

163
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,416
Do you have advice for us
on what we should do?

164
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,416
Hmm.

165
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,166
Hard to say.

166
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,166
It's not really my decision.

167
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,666
It's up to the other parents too.

168
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,875
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

169
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,541
I'd suggest, Tony,
you look at the website.

170
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,166
Keep an eye on the ranking updates, okay?

171
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,916
Uh, I know that.

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,833
But we're still down the list.

173
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,625
Could…

174
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,125
What's the number?

175
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,750
What does it have to be?

176
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
Money's not the problem.

177
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,833
Don't fret about it. It'll come.

178
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,750
It's about supporting
the education of our people.

179
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,250
- Right.
- Good luck.

180
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,916
Yeah.

181
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,666
Hey.

182
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,333
You haven't gotten in yet?

183
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,458
No wonder you bought out both lanes.

184
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,958
I thought you were bidding
at a celebrity night.

185
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,291
How much have you paid so far, huh?

186
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,666
You don't have kids.

187
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,208
You wouldn't understand
how it works for parents.

188
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,250
Uh, that person already paid 500,000.

189
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,541
Another paid 600,000
and are about to add another 300.

190
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,541
Toh,

191
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,583
how much do you
seriously need to raise a kid?

192
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,041
Her hormone test results
indicate she's already in puberty.

193
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,500
Her height is also above average.

194
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:24,083
Please keep in mind
this medicine won't affect her height.

195
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,625
- But it will slow growth.
- Just a little more, sweetheart.

196
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,583
And we will need to follow up regularly.

197
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,000
- All done!
- All done.

198
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,375
Well done, honey.

199
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,750
Yeah, she needs this treatment.

200
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,500
And the admission fees?

201
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,041
We're still in tenth place.

202
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,750
So how much more do you think we'll need?

203
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,333
Tuition aside.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,375
We have to pay anyway. Hmm?

205
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,041
The money we've already invested,
it's lost.

206
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,416
Huh?

207
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,458
These days,
language skills are everything, Toh.

208
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,500
You want our daughter
to have the best chance in life.

209
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:15,916
Come on.

210
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,541
Once you get promoted to manager,

211
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,291
things will be different.

212
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,125
You know that.

213
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,541
Shit.

214
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,041
Did your mom really have to agree to this?

215
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,666
This is goddamn robbery.

216
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,083
They beat the monks here.

217
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,375
Soon as Dad was dead,
they took everything before the funeral.

218
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,041
Nobody knows when Dad got into debt.

219
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,458
See?

220
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,041
Another gang.

221
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,875
Pet, what are you doing? Pet?

222
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,250
Oh!

223
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,333
- Hey!
- What are you doing?!

224
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,750
Hey, let go of him!

225
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,250
Oh, my God!

226
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,625
Hey, damn it, this is a funeral!

227
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,291
- Get down.
- This is my dad's funeral!

228
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,708
Hey, man. Come on.

229
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,750
- Stay still!
- Let me go!

230
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:47,708
Stop!

231
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,791
Sorry, man.

232
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,541
I didn't think it'd get like this.

233
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,750
Your dad picked some lender, huh?

234
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,375
They showed up as soon as he died.

235
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,291
I don't even know if the debt's real.

236
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,958
He never told me about it.

237
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,458
Or where his savings were kept.

238
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,500
Shit.

239
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,750
Just like my mom.

240
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,500
When she died,
I had no idea where she kept anything.

241
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,250
You know what?

242
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,708
I can check at my bank.

243
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,416
In case your dad deposited money there.

244
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,083
Thanks, man.

245
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,541
ACCOUNT NAME: KANT MANTATTHON

246

247
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,708
Hey, man, nothing at my bank.

248
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,666
Try checking other banks, okay?

249
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,250
Yeah, hope you find something.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,833
Mm-hmm.

251
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,958
Call anytime.

ACCOUNT STATUS: DORMANT

254
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey, Toh.

255
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,833
Mrs. Saowapa's loan approval,
could you check the info for me?

256
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,458
I've got some errands to run.

257
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,708
But shouldn't you do it?

258
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,208
You can handle it.
You're good with details.

259
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,291
And I'd like another perspective.

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,833
Last time, the case with Mr. Vi
went smoothly, right?

261
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,583
When you become manager,
you'll appreciate this practice.

262
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,916
We'll talk tomorrow.

263
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,541
Hello.

264
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,666
Snow.

265
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,625
Don't wait up.

266
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,416
You have your dinner.

267
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,375
Okay.

268
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,375
Go to bed early.

269
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,750
Okay, bye-bye.

270
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,333
So you're not done yet?

271
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,458
Need a hand?

272
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,958
- I can't afford to pay you anymore.
- Well, oh well. Your work is also mine.

273
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,041
Come on, let me help.

274
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,666
I'm serious.

275
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,708
Make some room. I'll take a look.

276
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,166
What?

277
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,083
This is Wut's work.

278
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:39,916
Yeah.

279
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,000
He comes in late

280
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,250
and then dumps all his work
on his workers, eh?

281
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,541
How does he get it so easy?

282
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,833
Come on.

283
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,291
Aren't you guys usually all lovey-dovey?

284
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,000
Sure, but I call him out
about something if he's wrong.

285
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,291
If you're wrong, I'll do the same.

286
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,750
Then hate me. I don't need your love.

287
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,666
Toh.

288
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,416
I think the system
makes it easy to exploit workers.

289
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,583
Look at you and me.

290
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,958
We work overtime,
and what do we get? Nothing.

291
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,750
In France, they're not allowed
to call you after working hours,

292
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,041
but look at things here.

293
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,041
Ugh!

294
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,791
Yeah, this is Pattaya, not Paris.

295
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:26,333
If you don't like it and you're not happy,

296
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,875
then you just have to leave,
so quit your whining.

297
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm not planning to stay long anyway.

298
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,416
But you?

299
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,500
It's your whole life.

300
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,833
You work hard.

301
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,958
You come in early and you leave late,

302
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,333
and in the end,

303
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,916
Wut took your spot
and left you with nothing.

304
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,750
Hey, I'm just trying
to be honest with you.

305
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,166
Shit.

306
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,125
No bonus this year.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,291
Oh, hey, Pet,
you shouldn't be looking at that.

308
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,666
Close it. Close it.

309
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,916
The AI has rated you below standard.

310
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:15,333
When they put us to work,
they say we're family.

311
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:19,875
But at decision time,
we're just employees.

312
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,500
In the end,
we have to look out for ourselves.

313
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,333
You know, when my mom died…

314
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,541
I didn't know about her money.

315
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,208
Had no idea where she'd put it.

316
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,208
Whenever I'm short,
I damn well miss that money

317
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:57,041
because in my head
it keeps growing every year, you see?

318
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,208
And think about it.

319
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,875
How many others like me don't even know
where their parents kept their money?

320
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,250
In the end, who benefits?

321
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:08,333
It's the damn banks profiting
and getting rich off other people's money.

322
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,916
And you worked your whole life for it.

323
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,041
But it's their money.

324
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,458
They can come get it any time.

325
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,416
But no one knows where it is.

326
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,333
Dormant accounts like this

327
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,250
are worth tens of billions
in the banking system now.

328
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:35,625
And we just let those
who exploit us get a lot richer.

329
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,875
We could use it ourselves.

330
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,625
I could fire you, Pet.

331
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,291
Losing this job's okay.

332
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,333
But you…

333
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,541
How long do you have?

334
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:07,875
The bank doesn't care about you.
Why should you care about it?

335
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,333
Don't act like you care for me.

336
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,708
I know you, Pet.

337
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,291
The reason you're asking
is because you know

338
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,833
it takes someone at the vice manager level
to unlock dormant accounts.

339
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:27,291
- Am I right, Pet?
- I know you need money, is why I'm asking.

340
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:29,208
Honestly.

341
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,541
Toh, if you end up like Shane,
you don't get a damn thing.

342
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:40,333
In your position, you can still do this
on your own if you want to.

343
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,708
Toh.

344
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,458
This money doesn't belong to the bank
any more than it belongs to us.

345
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,583
But if we get caught…

346
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,041
we won't just get fired.

347
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,166
We'll go to jail.

348
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,833
You can't go to jail without a plaintiff.

349
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,500
And if the plaintiff's dead,
who's gonna sue you?

350
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,666
Dead people, they can't sue.

351
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,375
But their relatives can, okay?

352
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,541
And how would you know
which of them have relatives?

353
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,708
Do you remember Jit?

354
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,291
I'm here to withdraw

355
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:25,791
and change some money
and pay the phone and water.

356
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,291
Count it up.

357
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:31,875
This phone app you gave me,
well, it's no use to anyone.

Actually, on the app,
you can do everything.

359
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,083
I'll show you so you can do it.

360

361
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,708

362
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,416

Doesn't matter what she did.
This money doesn't belong to anyone now.

370

It's up to you.

371
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,583
Let the bank pocket it, or use it
to invest in your daughter's future.

You're talking rubbish, Pet.

373
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,666
Just get out of here.

- Hi.
- Shane really fell, did he?

382
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,458
I'm afraid so.

383
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,083
Oh, it's so scary.

384
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,958
- Do you know why he did it?
- I think it was an accident.

385
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,958
At least, that's what everybody's
been saying this morning.

386

Hi, can I withdraw cash?

392
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,833
Of course.

393
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,166
How much would you like to withdraw?

394
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,833
- Four thousand.
- Very good.

395
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,625
Mr. Chaiwat, if you're in no hurry,

396
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,541

Take your time to think it over,

don't act like we're close, okay?

00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,625
When…

432
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,958
can we take it out again?

433
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:16,250
I need it. I've got to fix up
the paint on my Rolls-Royce.

434
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500

435

Think you can just disappear, huh?

437
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Did you forget about our boss?

438
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,250
And his car repair bill.

439
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,291
When are you gonna pay it back?

440
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:14,958
- You good?
- Don't take too long.

449
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,791
<i>I need a lot, okay?</i>

450
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,333
<i>Okay.</i>

451
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,708
<i>I need the money now too.</i>

452
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:29,708
Wut,

453
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,625
the Sara account.

454
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,125
I've checked her history.

455
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,416
It should be okay.

456
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:39,583
Should I also check on the other cases?

457
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,375
I was just about to call you.

458
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:44,375
Have a seat.

459
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,541
You're one of the longest-serving
employees.

460
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:24,916
You've been our outstanding employee
for four years now, right?

461
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,708
But the AI takes
many factors into account.

462
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:35,416
It doesn't know about things that I do.

463
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:40,500
I know…

464
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,541
that you looked at the evaluation file.

465
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,708
But for your sake,

466
00:37:51,291 --> 00:37:52,791
I'll overlook it.

467
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,708
Here's the deal.

468
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,333
You help me.

469
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:02,750
And I'll help you.

470
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,250
I'm counting on you
to handle some of my work today,

471
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,000
but don't open any other files.

472
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:13,000
Wut,

473
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,083
I'm sorry.

474
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,333
Oh.

475
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,916

499
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:33,458

500
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,125

501

Bitch.

502
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,625
I had people looking for her for years.

503
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:43,833
No luck.

504
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,458
Then I heard she died.

505
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,833
Turns out, she's got a daughter.

506
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,625
Bet she's got no idea,

507
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,166
or she would have
cleaned out the account already.

508
00:42:57,916 --> 00:43:00,208
Good thing it's only 30 million.

509
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:09,083

Ah! Hey!

516
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:08,625
I've been waiting. I thought you ran off.

517
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:12,791
In those heist movies,
how do they move millions at a time, eh?

518
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,208
If we take out something like 20 million,
it's like 20 kilograms.

519
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:19,750
We'd need a wheelbarrow.
Movies are full of shit.

520

Cut the chat. Let's get on with it.

Yeah.

00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,333
Okay.

525
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,708
Uh-huh, okay. Yeah, I will. Yeah.

526
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:17,833
Snow?

527
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,666
- You tired, honey?
- Yes, I am.

528
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,250
- Take a break.
- Toh, Toh.

529
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,583
- Hmm?
- Let her finish her session first.

530
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:26,833
Yeah. Okay.

531
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,041
I will.

532
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:34,000
Of course I'll go.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

533
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,000
Hmm? Oh.

534
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,750
Oh, I see.

535
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,375
Right, okay.

536
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:44,708
Okay, sure.

537
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:45,916
Goodbye.

538
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,291
Tomorrow, I'll have someone
come and spray the whole house for bugs.

539
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:55,166
Our daughter is allergic to mosquitoes.

540
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,166
- Hmm. Can I have your phone?
- Oh.

541
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,291
Also, the moms from her old school

542
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:04,416
have invited us on a trip to Korea
during the term break.

543
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:08,625
I think we should wait
until a class schedule comes out.

544
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:12,583
But it's good for her
to keep connections with her friends.

545
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:15,125
All right, blink three times.

546
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,333
Okay.

547
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,750
Oh, by the way,
the school admission fee is due tomorrow.

548
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,708
Is everything taken care of?

549
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,833
Mm.

550
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,208
You keep earning money.

551
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,500
Fifteen million is just for admission.

552
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:42,500
So for the next 12 years, don't get sick,
don't get hurt and don't die, okay?

553
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,333
Hmm.

554
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:45,916
That's right.

555
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,125
Hmm?

556
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,083
Oh.

557
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,041
Come on, Snow. You're done.

558
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,791
Time to take a shower, honey.

559
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,458
Are you tired?

560
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:59,333
Come on, honey. Quick now.

561
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,791
There was a bit in your dad's account.

562
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,458
Here you go.

563
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,583
But you said there wasn't any.

564
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,041
I looked harder.

565
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,791
Gotta go.

566
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,583
Call me anytime.

567
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,166
Hey, guys. Call him.

568
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,625
Okay, okay.

569
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:48,291
Hey, hey, what the fuck?

570
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,125
Come on, man. Faster.

571
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,750
- You gotta do it, man.
- I know already!

572
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,291
Till dusk, till dark.

573
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:02,375
- Hey, I need you to check this.
- Yeah, sure.

574
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,291
There you are, Sek.

575
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,583
Seven hundred thousand.

576
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,541
We're square now.

577
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,208
Seven hundred thousand.

578
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,833
That only covers my car door.

579
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,250
What?

580
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:28,250
Don't touch me, you bastards.

581
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,458
Don't come any closer.

582
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,541
You asshole, you said 700.

583
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:35,625
I checked, and the engine wasn't working.

584
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,208
I hit the back door, not the engine.

585
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,833
Oh, how the fuck would you know?
You're a mechanic now, are you?

586
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:50,500
Hey, hey. hey. Careful with his face.

587
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,625
We still need it to unlock his phone.

588
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,416
Here.

589
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,166
You get me my money.

590
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,666
Give me his phone.

591
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,250
No, no! Let me go!

592
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,875
I need to scan your face, okay?

593
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,291
Open your eyes.

594
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,250
Come on, smile, you bastard.

595
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,541
Open your eyes.

596
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:33,000
Ooh, damn.

597
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,333
Listen to me now.

598
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,416
You know what knives are for?

599
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:40,791
Aside from cooking,

600
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,000
they're for killing.

601
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,875
But if you bring it and don't use it,

602
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,416
don't bring it at all.

603
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:21,083
Well, we don't have exact figures,

604
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,875
but around 30% are Thai.

605
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,500
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
The numbers are very interesting.

606
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:31,208
Hi, Tony.

607
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:33,250
- Hello.
- We meet again.

608
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,791
Thank you for visiting.

609
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,791
How's everything going
with what we talked about last time?

610
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,791
I hope the spirits
bring you happiness, Jit.

611
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:47,625
And I thank you for sponsoring Snow.

612
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:00,916
Yeah.

613
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,291
<i>Tony?</i>

614
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:08,708
You sound… like a sex caller.

615
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:09,958
All husky.

616
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:12,416
<i>Toh.</i>

617
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,958
<i>I-I need another million.</i>

618
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,500
Another paint job
for a spaceship now, huh?

619
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:24,583
Taking money out too often
will look suspicious.

620
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:25,666
<i>Toh.</i>

621
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:28,875
<i>I really need it urgently.</i>

622
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:30,666
<i>Very urgently.</i>

623
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,583
We can't do it now.

624
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,458
Get it somewhere else.

625
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,708
I have to go. I'm busy.

626
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:09,791
Are you waiting for a friend?

627
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,708
What's your name?

628
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,375
I don't do that kind of thing.

629
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:25,916
It's nothing like that.
I need your name to open a bank account.

630
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,250
Just once off, and I'll be gone.

631
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,500
Okay. How much?

632
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,916
Ten thousand.

633
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,791
Mm.

634
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:17,250
ENTER ID CARD INFORMATION

635
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:26,916
WELCOME TO SINWATTANA BANK.
HELLO, MISS ACHARAPHON.

636
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,708
Don't you try and cheat me now.

637
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,958
I know who you are and where you live.
Get out.

PROCESSING, PLEASE WAIT…
WE ARE COUNTING YOUR CASH

644
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,583
I'm going now, Dr. Khem.
See you next time.

645
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,416
Okay, see you next time.

646
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,208
Alcohol damages collagen.

647
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,500
That's why your skin's rough.

648
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,166
I can see that.

649
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,291
Come on in.

650
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,541
How old are you?

651
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,791
Thirty-five.

652
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:50,208
Your skin's already 53.

653
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:53,333
You'll probably need
both Botox and filler.

654
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,958
Who recommended me to you?

655
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:01,500
You really should have
made an appointment.

656
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:03,958
I usually close up at 9:00,

657
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:07,125
but since you're already here,
I'll make an exception.

658
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:13,583
Why don't you lie down?

659
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,875
I'll give you a facial massage
on the house.

660
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:26,333
By the way, your eyebrows
seem to have developed deep lines.

661
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:31,458
How about I inject 2 cc of filler
under your eyes and your forehead.

662
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:34,416
Why don't you lay down,
and I'll take care of it for you.

663
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,791
I need to talk to you about something.

664
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,541
Your mother.

665
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,916
Not the one who raised you.

666
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,333
Your biological mother.

667
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,791
Your mother worked as a maid for my boss.

668
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,750
She stole a few million, then ran away.

669
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,916
Why tell me this?

670
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,166
I didn't know her.

671
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:33,916
I know.

672
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,875
Your mom got your aunt to raise you.

673
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,125
But now,

674
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:43,875
only you can withdraw money
from your mom's account.

675
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,541
She died a long time ago.

676
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:16,625
So even in death, she causes me grief.

677
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,000
Is this true?

678
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,791
So this is her.

679
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,083
I wouldn't know.

680
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:43,625
She'd left that in her room.

681
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:47,583
When she ran away, she took nothing.

682
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,333
I don't want her money anyway.

683
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,291
What do you want me to do?

684
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:36,291
Welcome, new students,
to Pattaya International College.

685
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,250
I'm Mister J. I'm the school principal.

686
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,166
All the parents here
must be very proud of you

687
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,416
because it's not easy
to get into this school.

688
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,458
But we do have some Thai classes,

689
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:52,083
Thai history classes,
Thai language classes,

690
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,958
so they don't forget
about their roots too.

691
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:57,250
You chose the right school…

692
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,166
TRANSFER OUT 988,000 BAHT

693
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,708
Actually, a lot of our students
that graduate…

694
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:06,250
REMAINING BALANCE: 0. 00 BAHT

695
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:10,708
Why are you even asking?

696
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,708
I'm bored and you didn't try.

697
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,333
As if he'd come.

698
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:17,666
What are we waiting for?

699
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:18,958
You fucking cheated me.

700
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:25,541
It's in my account, not yours.

701
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:27,958
Paying for one account

702
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:30,500
is usually only 500.

703
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,583
This is your first time, isn't it?

704
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,916
And you!

705
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,458
You fucking tricked me!

706
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,500
If I see you around here again,

707
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,708
your head's gonna be full of holes
like the ground, you get me?

708
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:02,333
So where are you going?

709
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,291
I don't know, man.

710
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:05,958
Where are you going?

711
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,750
Oh, I-I-I'm not catching up with you, man.

712
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,125
Nah, nah. You watch from up there.

713
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:13,708
Take it like that.

714
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,208
What's that?

715
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:22,166
- So you're gonna come this time?
- You were scared.

716
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,958
- I'm coming.
- You were scared.

717
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:26,583
I saw you.
You didn't know what you were doing.

718
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,208
How long ago since she ran off to Pattaya?

719
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:36,750
She moved around a lot of places
before settling in Pattaya.

720
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,708
So this money, it's dirty money, right?

721
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,875
I was born in Pattaya.

722
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,916
Only a few days later,
she gave me to my aunt.

723
01:06:05,541 --> 01:06:07,291
Then we moved away from there.

724
01:06:08,208 --> 01:06:09,958
So I never saw her again.

725
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:16,291
Even if she was a bad mother,

726
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:22,166
I never thought she'd be bad enough
to cheat people out of money.

727
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,500
If we get the money,

728
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:38,916
can you take me to the owner?

729
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,916
I'd like to apologize to her.

730
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:51,958
Maybe.

731
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:55,708
Okay, thanks.

732
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,041
I might take a walk.

733
01:07:57,416 --> 01:07:58,708
MOMMY KUNG

734
01:07:58,791 --> 01:08:00,083
MOMMY KUNG
CALLING

735
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:11,500
<i>The number</i>
<i>you are calling is not available.</i>

736
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,083
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, HONEY

737
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:18,666
MOM, PLEASE CALL ME BACK

738
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,750
SATTAHIP
PATTAYA

739
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:42,916
ACCOUNT NAME: THANOMJIT JITDEE

740
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,541
BALANCE: 25,025,924.80 BAHT

741
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,916
WITHDRAWAL: 100,000.00 BAHT

742
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,208
WITHDRAWAL: 4,000,000.00 BAHT

743
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,000
Shit, Pet.

744
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,208
Moo, a customer needs
to withdraw 25 million urgently.

745
01:09:57,291 --> 01:09:58,875
Can you handle it for me?

746
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,375
<i>But we don't have enough cash.</i>

747
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,583
Check on the cash transport.

748
01:10:04,666 --> 01:10:08,291
<i>Don't we have to notify Wut first</i>
<i>if we withdraw that much?</i>

749
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,583
So do it in three parts.

750
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,166
Okay?

751
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,750
I'll okay it.

752
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:16,625
Hello there.

753
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,625
- Hello.
- How can I help today?

754
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:20,458
Come this way.

755
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,791
- All set, Moo?
- All set, yes.

756
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,750
MR. PRAPON KITCHRUNGRAT,
OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR

757
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,916
WITHDRAWAL CONFIRMATION

758
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:21,541
WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: 25,000,000.00 BAHT
BY MR. PRAPON KITCHRUNGRAT

759
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,375
Hey, Toh.

760
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,666
There was a dormant account.

761
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,000
It was unlocked recently.

762
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,458
You authorized it.

763
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:57,916
And the money has been
gradually withdrawn by Pet.

764
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,583
The last transaction was…

765
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,333
Is that money in there?

766
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:11,833
Are you in debt, Toh?

767
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,750
My daughter's education.

768
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,750
You're Employee of the Year.

769
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,083
What do I get?

770
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,125
They're going to fire me anyway.

771
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:32,750
Just like Shane.

772
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,708
If I lose my job…

773
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:42,750
my daughter will have to leave her--

774
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,375
Toh, if you can't afford
an expensive school,

775
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,375
there are lots of good alternatives.

776
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,583
At any rate…

777
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:57,291
her education comes first.

778
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:02,125
This money…

779
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,750
belongs to no one.

780
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:11,541
Jit, the owner, she died a long time ago.

781
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:15,583
She has no relatives,
so the money's just sitting there.

782
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,625
Nobody owns it.

783
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,208
How about…

784
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,583
we split it?

785
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,791
You can take half.

786
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,000
Or 70/30.

787
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,750
They trusted you here.

788
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,291
How could you do this?

789
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,291
Okay, your daughter's still young.

790
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:26,041
Leave this golf bag here

791
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,166
and return all the money.

792
01:14:29,916 --> 01:14:31,708
Then I won't report this.

793
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:37,666
After a while,
you should just resign voluntarily.

794
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:40,583
Where are you?

795
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,875
Did you withdraw the money again?

796
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,250
You better have it with you, Pet.

797
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:47,916
I'm coming for it.

798
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:51,000
<i>Actually, I wanted to see you too.</i>

799
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,750
<i>- I'll send the location.</i>
- Yeah.

800
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,708
You shithead.

801
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:14,708
Fuck.

802
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:20,375
PETCH

803
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,791
Son of a bitch! Fuck!

804
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:17,791
Yeah, hey!

805
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:35,958
If you love your friends so much,

806
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:38,416
you wouldn't run away so fast, asshole.

807
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,958
What's going on, Pet?

808
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:50,291
I heard you managed to get some money
from a dead person's account.

809
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,750
I heard it was a lot too.

810
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:55,916
Wasn't it?

811
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,250
You stupid or what?

812
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:07,166
Doing it too often will screw us all over.

813
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,041
See, this is all between you two.

814
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:17,375
It's not my problem.

815
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:21,750
It's not that easy.

816
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:22,833
Ah!

817
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,583
You know I don't like people
who refuse me, right?

818
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,375
There's lots of dormant accounts.

819
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,208
It has to be a dead person
with no relatives.

820
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,958
Okay.

821
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:48,666
Then get the rest of the money
from this account and bring it to me.

822
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,625
I heard there's 20 million.

823
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,208
Right?

824
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:06,333
Is that right?

825
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,333
It's gone.

826
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:19,041
The manager found out.

827
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,708
He took it all.

828
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,791
But I…

829
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:33,208
can take you guys to get it.

830
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:43,083
Okay.

831
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,083
Hey!

832
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,416
Fuck!

833
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:11,000
- Toh, what the hell?
- It's in the golf bag.

834
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,833
- Look for it.
- Check upstairs.

835
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:16,500
Sorry, our secret deal, it's off now.

836
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,916
- I'll fire all of you.
- Weren't you going to do that anyway?

837
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,125
You'll all go to jail.

838
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:22,916
Your names are on the withdrawal records,
not mine.

839
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:27,000
And I'll throw your wife in jail.
Your daughter will have to leave school.

840
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,333
These bastards too.

841
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,750
I'll see every last one of you
behind bars.

842
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,166
Fuck you!

843
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,708
I told you if you have a knife,
you'd better use it.

844
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,291
I found it, boss.

845
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,375
Show me.

846
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,333
Take it. You can buy him a coffin.

847
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,708
I'm going to need more next time.

848
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:08,541
Don't make me come for it.

849
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:19,958
Hey, Pet.

850
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,916
Hey, Pet, help me out here.

851
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:38,208
Help with what?

852
01:22:42,416 --> 01:22:44,166
Here. We'll hide the body in here for now.

853
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,000
Are you insane? Hide it?

854
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:48,125
We need to call the police, Toh. This is…

855
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:50,500
The police! They need to be here.

856
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,041
Don't be stupid.

857
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:55,958
You and I, we took Jit's money,
and now the manager's dead.

858
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,541
You think you can get out of it?

859
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,958
A guy like Wut disappears,

860
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:02,750
no one will give a damn.

861
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:08,000
Come on.

862
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:30,833
I'M TAKING A WEEK OFF.

863
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:33,666
IF SOMETHING COMES UP, TOH WILL HANDLE IT.

864
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,916
<i>Close all the curtains.</i>

865
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,916
<i>Turn the AC up as cold as it'll go.</i>

866
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:46,958
<i>We should go to Cambodia.</i>

867
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:49,875
<i>If you run now, you don't get shit.</i>

868
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:56,125
<i>Even if I end up in jail,</i>

869
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,958
<i>I'm getting that money back first.</i>

870
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,750
<i>One step at a time.</i>

871
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:00,250
What happened to you?

872
01:26:00,333 --> 01:26:01,500
I fell at the bank.

873
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:04,083
Oh. Can I have your phone?

874
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:08,333
Snow's friend's having a birthday.
I picked an outfit for her.

875
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:11,875
And I signed her up for online music
and Chinese language classes.

876
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,208
They start next week.

877
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:16,833
Oh, yeah, and the school,
they're asking again for the tuition fees.

878
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:18,250
Haven't you paid it yet?

879
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:20,875
Hey, look here.

880
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,208
Here.

881
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,458
Hey.

882
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,708
Smile and show your teeth.

883
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,083
Mm-hmm.

884
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:33,666
Toh?

885
01:26:34,458 --> 01:26:36,458
How did you pay the admission fees?

886
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,416
Our account balance
hasn't gone down at all.

887
01:26:41,708 --> 01:26:42,750
Bonus.

888
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:45,833
What bonus is out now?

889
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:03,416
Well, you're the one who checks
the balance on the phone every day.

890
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,708
Where else do you think
the money comes from?

891
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:10,166
Do you really think
what you give each month is enough?

892
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,083
Huh?

893
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:14,000
There's food and toys.

894
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,541
I look after all of that.

895
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:17,416
You don't pay for everything.

896
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:21,125
I don't want to have to ask
for money every month.

897
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,125
Do you want me to go back to work?

898
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,833
Huh?

899
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:26,958
Of course not.

900
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:31,166
Didn't you say you wanted us
to raise our daughter together?

901
01:27:33,583 --> 01:27:35,125
How about we switch?

902
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,291
You try it for a change.

903
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:41,125
You take our daughter
to school every day, huh?

904
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:44,166
You try organizing play dates
and meeting other parents,

905
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:46,583
then you'll know perhaps what it's like.

906
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:50,791
You don't know
what I've sacrificed for all of us.

907
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:52,458
You don't know either…

908
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,291
how much I've sacrificed…

909
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:00,958
for you

910
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,125
and our daughter.

911
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,666
Excuse me.

912
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:01,708
I'm here to inquire about money
in Mrs. Thanomjit's account.

913
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,250
I'm her daughter.

914
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,416
I think she had an account here.

915
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,250
She passed away years ago.

916
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:18,416
Uh, do you have any proof
that you're her daughter?

917
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:22,916
A23, please proceed
to counter number four.

918
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:28,833
A23, please proceed
to counter number four.

919
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,916
- Hello.
- Please come with me.

920
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,500
- B3, please come this way.
- Just a moment.

921
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:40,791
Uh, yes, I'm here to deposit some money.

922
01:30:11,583 --> 01:30:15,833
This alone is not enough
to verify your credentials at the bank.

923
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:17,625
Even if you are her daughter,

924
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:20,250
you must be appointed
a state administrator

925
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:22,791
before you can manage this account.

926
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:26,375
- But I thought that…
- You need to contact the court. Please.

927
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:29,583
- You said that?
- Anything wrong?

928
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:44,541
Can you at least check if there's still
money being held in that account?

929
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,625
I'm sorry, no.

930
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,000
Customer confidentiality.

931
01:30:57,833 --> 01:30:59,833
This proves she's her daughter.

932
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:09,416
BIRTH CERTIFICATE: ADCHARA JITDEE

933
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,250
MOTHER: THANOMJIT JITDEE

934
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:28,250
This evidence is not sufficient.

935
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:31,708
Go prove yourself in court,
then you can come back.

936
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,875
I understand.

937
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:47,625
Then…

938
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:50,958
I'll come back later.

939
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:02,791
Pet.

940
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:05,916
Go find out who those two really are.

941
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,958
How did you get that document?

942
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:43,791
From your adoptive mother.

943
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:45,458
You visited my mother?

944
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,000
Could I find you another way?

945
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:50,625
So, you…

946
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:02,416
Tell the owner of the money
that I can't return it now.

947
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:03,791
Ah!

948
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,458
Ah!

949
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:30,125
Hey!

950
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:31,958
Hurry.

951
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:01,166
Pack your things and Snow's.

952
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:02,958
We're going somewhere for a while.

953
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:12,541
- What's going on?
- Don't ask now.

954
01:35:17,375 --> 01:35:18,791
Just pack your things.

955
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:21,416
Do it now.

956
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:28,958
Snow?

957
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:30,708
Snow.

958
01:35:31,458 --> 01:35:32,958
Let's pack our bags.

959
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:34,875
Daddy's taking us on a trip.

960
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:37,083
Let's go!

961
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:02,833
Is he dead?

962
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,791
I don't know.

963
01:37:09,916 --> 01:37:11,375
Why are we here?

964
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:14,125
It's a place where we're safe.

965
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:16,000
Where nobody will try anything.

966
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:27,416
Damn it.

967
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:45,083
That's all I could find.

968
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:46,875
Thank you.

969
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,083
So, are you really Jit's daughter?

970
01:37:58,583 --> 01:37:59,916
You could say that.

971
01:38:02,125 --> 01:38:03,000
What do you mean?

972
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:06,458
I was only a few days old
when she gave me away.

973
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,875
Who was that guy who came with you?

974
01:38:15,208 --> 01:38:17,583
What made you decide to come with him?

975
01:38:18,583 --> 01:38:20,166
He told me my mother

976
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:22,833
stole some money.

977
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:25,291
I just wanted to make amends.

978
01:38:28,208 --> 01:38:29,750
Don't you think he's lying?

979
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,250
I remember she called me…

980
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:42,541
many years ago.

981
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:47,166
Said she was my mother.

982
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:51,916
She apologized for giving me away

983
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,916
because she became pregnant
to someone she shouldn't have.

984
01:38:57,666 --> 01:39:00,916
She said she wanted
to make things right with me.

985
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:05,000
She said she had money to give me.

986
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,583
She asked me to come to Pattaya.

987
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,166
You didn't want to see her?

988
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,333
No.

989
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,375
I hung up, blocked her number.

990
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,833
Is it really that easy
to cut ties with someone?

991
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,583
Wasn't that hard for her to do.

992
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:56,916
Welcome.

993
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,000
Your mother lived alone?

994
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,958
When she died, nobody knew.

995
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,541
Probably months later.

996
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:19,166
Before somebody found her.

997
01:40:24,416 --> 01:40:25,750
When she called you…

998
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,083
she was lonely.

999
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:44,000
Her choice.

1000
01:40:51,833 --> 01:40:52,875
Welcome.

1001
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:53,833
Anyhow…

1002
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:57,541
who cares about that money?

1003
01:40:59,416 --> 01:41:00,875
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1004
01:41:01,833 --> 01:41:03,500
That guy knows where you live.

1005
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:07,125
Do you think he's gonna
let you go just like that?

1006
01:41:10,083 --> 01:41:11,500
Then I'll go to the police.

1007
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:39,750
So?

1008
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,791
<i>Toh.</i>

1009
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:44,250
<i>This woman really is Jit's daughter.</i>

1010
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,333
<i>And that guy who came with her,</i>

1011
01:41:47,416 --> 01:41:49,666
<i>he's trying to collect money for his boss.</i>

1012
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:52,583
So when she was unable to get the money,

1013
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:54,375
he would have hurt her.

1014
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,541
<i>So I took her to a beer bar to hide out.</i>

1015
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:01,000
<i>He was fucking brutal.</i>

1016
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:06,125
Why the fuck are you helping her?
You need to deal with her.

1017
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:14,041
What if she gets the papers
and tries to get the money back?

1018
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:15,416
What do we do then?

1019
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,375
Toh, what was I supposed to do?

1020
01:42:18,458 --> 01:42:19,791
He'll kill her.

1021
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:26,583
Yeah.

1022
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:31,250
This kind of guy's a fucking animal.

1023
01:42:31,333 --> 01:42:32,666
Oof.

1024
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,458
If this guy got serious,

1025
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:37,125
<i>I doubt anyone would make it out alive.</i>

1026
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:40,875
Yeah.

1027
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,458
Let's get back what's ours from Sek.

1028
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:45,791
<i>Toh.</i>

1029
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:47,916
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

1030
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,500
<i>You know how brutal that fucker is, right?</i>

1031
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:53,958
But if we do fuck all, we're dead anyway.

1032
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:55,958
Go find that guy.

1033
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,958
Bring him to Sek's warehouse.

1034
01:42:58,041 --> 01:42:59,708
I can meet you there.

1035
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,833
How the hell do I find him, though?

1036
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:09,833
Oh.

1037
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:22,250
Hello?

1038
01:43:22,875 --> 01:43:25,083
<i>You can't get away from me.</i>

1039
01:43:25,166 --> 01:43:26,708
<i>I know where you are.</i>

1040
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,333
Yeah.

1041
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,166
And where are you?

1042
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,708
I'm sorry.

1043
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:37,916
I've got…

1044
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:42,208
something urgent to deal with.

1045
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,333
It's complicated.

1046
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:48,333
I'll update you later.

1047
01:43:51,791 --> 01:43:53,250
When it's over,

1048
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:54,583
promise me

1049
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:56,958
that you'll tell me everything.

1050
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:10,250
Take care of yourself.

1051
01:44:19,916 --> 01:44:21,416
You be good, girl.

1052
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:26,625
For your mom now.

1053
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:28,666
The real owner is here
to take back his money.

1054
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:30,291
Pet's bringing him here now.

1055
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,541
I wouldn't mess with this guy,

1056
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:34,208
unless you want to die.

1057
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:36,125
Be smart and return his money.

1058
01:45:47,875 --> 01:45:50,500
So you're bringing him here? Huh?

1059
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:52,750
Bastard.

1060
01:45:52,833 --> 01:45:53,791
He's got a gun.

1061
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:57,958
I came to warn you.

1062
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:03,416
Let me tell you something.
Nobody gets tough with me on my turf.

1063
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,916
This guy, he does.

1064
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,583
You won't like it.

1065
01:46:08,625 --> 01:46:09,833
Ah!

1066
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:13,750
You guys, go get the rest of the crew.

1067
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:15,166
Tell them it's urgent.

1068
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:37,250
If you settle with them,

1069
01:46:38,625 --> 01:46:40,291
leave us alone for good.

1070
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:38,750
So you're the one coming for my money.

1071
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:42,041
You're the one who took my money.

1072
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:46,708
Why did you bring him here?

1073
01:47:47,666 --> 01:47:49,375
- Pet!
- Hey!

1074
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:55,833
Boss!

1107
01:52:12,333 --> 01:52:13,375
That's enough.

1108

You want the money bad, huh?

1109
01:52:17,958 --> 01:52:19,041
Just take it.

1110
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,708
Take it.

1111
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:23,500
I never wanted it.

1112
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,041
You don't want it either, right?

1113
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:41,541
You don't give up.

1114
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:49,541
It's for my kid.

1115
01:52:50,333 --> 01:52:51,666
Is that true?

1116
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:54,375
I've heard that before.

1117
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:58,750
But I doubt that excuse
makes it much better.

1118
01:53:05,958 --> 01:53:07,416
I don't want to kill you.

1119
01:53:09,291 --> 01:53:11,291
And I don't want to live in fear of you.

1120
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:15,125
Take the money,

1121
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:17,083
