1
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,693
- Do you want the usual?
- Yes, please.

2
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,718
Um... Gin and tonic, please.

3
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,307
You know, there's really
something about this bar.

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,437
Feels like it's stuck in time.

5
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,430
I think...

6
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:39,849
Some people really are just...

7
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,321
looking for that.

8
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,442
I don’t even know
why I came back here.

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,245
Well, no one's stopping you.

10
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:55,870
Don’t come back
if you don’t want to.

11
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,161
But...

12
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,305
I’m sure of one thing—

13
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,019
you’ll come back.

14
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,446
Girl, are you drowning in alcohol too...

15
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,199
just to forget your
messed-up life?

16
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:08,992
Yep.

17
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,602
What happened this time?

18
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,773
Javi said I’m exhausting.

19
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,408
Well, he's not wrong, right?

20
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,776
Wow! Aren’t you
supposed to be on my side?

21
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,679
I’m your mirror, girl.

22
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,271
If you don't like what you see—

23
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,677
then break the mirror.

24
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,648
Damn, you sound like you’re
reading a movie one-liner.

25
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,269
And you? You sound like a live DM.

26
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,107
Tell me,

27
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:40,841
don’t you think I’m worthy
of real love?

28
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,710
Not saying that—

29
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,196
maybe you just don’t know
how to change.

30
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,281
You okay?

31
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:18,447
What are you doing there?

32
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:23,206
I’m okay. The smell
of car smoke calms me.

33
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,298
Seriously?

34
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:27,004
Mind if I sit?

35
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,431
Sure.

36
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:32,928
I’m Raf, by the way.

37
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:34,611
What’s your name?

38
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:36,652
Lila.

39
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:38,200
You with someone?

40
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:40,959
No. I just don’t wanna go home.

41
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,297
Same.

42
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:47,428
You play in a band?

43
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:48,894
Yup.

44
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:51,189
Guitarist.

45
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,544
Not the best, but...

46
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,087
I play with feeling.

47
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:57,326
Same with me...

48
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:58,940
When it comes to sex...

49
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,813
Not great,

50
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:02,573
but with feeling.

51
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,624
Ever tried just walking around?

52
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,399
Like...

53
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,471
in a rom-com?

54
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,005
Sort of.

55
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,729
Two strangers—no plans,

56
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:18,301
just walk.

57
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:22,763
I’m down.

58
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,625
Do you believe in love at first sight?

59
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,748
I don’t believe in love.

60
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,422
Liar.

61
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,940
What made you say that?

62
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:38,284
It doesn’t seem believable.

63
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,891
Really?

64
00:08:40,364 --> 00:08:41,364
Yes.

65
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,179
So...

66
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:44,793
bye?

67
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:49,623
Can we still meet up?

68
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,139
Maybe.

69
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:54,000
Aren’t you gonna follow?

70
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:55,407
Do you want me
to follow you?

71
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,079
The story won’t happen
if you don’t go along.

72
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,256
You seem like you’re in
your own world, huh?

73
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,313
I let my own ghosts
stay here too.

74
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:50,991
You know, sometimes—

75
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,267
It’s like I want—

76
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,077
to escape
from my own body.

77
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,985
Like, I want to be a different
person just for a night.

78
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,582
Maybe that’s why I’m here.

79
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,231
Why are you still here?

80
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,353
You didn’t exactly tell me to leave.

81
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,572
Oh, by the way, I poked
around your kitchen.

82
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,159
Have some coffee.

83
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,229
It’s hot.

84
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,338
You’re not gonna ghost me?

85
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,423
You know,

86
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,177
I’m not the kind of person
who just disappears.

87
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,221
I’m more like cigarette smoke—

88
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,015
I fade out slowly.

89
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:22,758
You know,

90
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
I have a sister.

91
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
But...

92
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,819
we don’t see each other anymore.

93
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,558
Older, or younger?

94
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,772
She’s older.

95
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,595
When our mom died,

96
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,382
we were supposed to run away.

97
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,392
She didn’t wanna stay anymore.

98
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:56,744
And I told her, neither did I.

99
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,106
But in the end, she left, and I didn’t.

100
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:04,757
She called me,

101
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:06,719
maybe...

102
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:08,832
just last year,

103
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:11,800
but I didn’t answer.

104
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,376
Sometimes I wonder—

105
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,277
does she still talk about me
to other people,

106
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:26,191
or has she erased me from her story?

107
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,345
Like maybe...

108
00:15:29,957 --> 00:15:32,129
there’s just a version of me she imagines.

109
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,327
You miss her?

110
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,441
I miss who I was back then.

111
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,920
Sis?

112
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:46,077
Hi, Ma.

113
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:48,805
Oh!

114
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,965
You smell like beer... and a woman!

115
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,054
Where’ve you been?

116
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:55,928
Nowhere special.

117
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,323
When are you going
to apply for a job?

118
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:03,820
When I find the time.

119
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,457
Long Island.

120
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,378
You ghosted me.

121
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,188
I don’t believe in ghosts.

122
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,276
What happened to you?

123
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,555
You look like you’re sick.

124
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:38,280
Nothing.

125
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,283
Just swallowed a knife.

126
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:44,304
Have you ever said anything
remotely sane in your life?

127
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:49,311
I think... when I was eight.

128
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,686
You’re gonna bang me again, aren’t you?

129
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,703
Wow, you know me so well.

130
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,346
Of course I do.

131
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:06,164
You know,

132
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,964
I feel like you’re gonna
get bored of me—

133
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:11,210
like I do.

134
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,175
Probably.

135
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,500
Shit!

136
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,810
What?

137
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,103
You see that girl behind me?

138
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,574
Another one you tricked?

139
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:31,630
Come on, I’ll hide you.

140
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
I’m close!

141
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,843
You’re so good.

142
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,660
Thank you.

143
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,859
Hot coffee latte, please.

144
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:14,862
Thank you.

145
00:22:23,906 --> 00:22:24,949
Hey.

146
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,664
You were at the laundromat
the other day, right?

147
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,512
Just because we did laundry
on the same day,

148
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,771
I’m supposed to talk to you now?

149
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,013
Not really.

150
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,112
But hey,

151
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,946
at least we have something in common.

152
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,575
We both like clean clothes.

153
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,577
I’m Raf, by the way.

154
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,106
Maya.

155
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,042
Okay, I got to get back to work.

156
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,173
- I was just gonna say something.
- What—flirting?

157
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:04,956
Whoa.

158
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,305
You a psychic?

159
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,222
This isn’t new to me.

160
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,567
I know your type.

161
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,133
So...

162
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,741
- What’s the secret?
- Huh?

163
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:23,693
Secret to getting you to like me?

164
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,492
And why would I tell you that?

165
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:31,948
Because...

166
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:33,935
I’m being honest?

167
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,746
First time I’ve ever been.

168
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,294
So your honesty’s a favor
I should be grateful for?

169
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,006
You know what, quit
trying to impress me.

170
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,842
It’s not gonna work.

171
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,512
Next time, just say it straight.

172
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:53,684
Like this: “I want to
take you out on a date.”

173
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,189
Okay, fine.

174
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,753
Straight up. No bullshit, no pick-up lines.

175
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:06,994
I want to take you out.

176
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,322
Like, a real date.

177
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:11,482
At an actual restaurant.

178
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,872
I’ll even eat veggies
if you’re vegetarian.

179
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,876
You really think that
if we have dinner,

180
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:25,021
I’ll forget you’re just
like all the other guys

181
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,423
who just want to get laid?

182
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,302
I don’t think so.

183
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:34,891
It’s just dinner, that’s it. We eat.

184
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,810
Maybe talk a little. That’s all.
Let’s start from there.

185
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,399
Thursday. 8 PM.

186
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:46,401
Let’s do it here, to
keep things easy.

187
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:50,795
But if you’re even a
minute late, I’m leaving.

188
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,325
Okay. Got it.

189
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:19,136
This is your idea of a first date?

190
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:21,231
This isn’t a date.

191
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:23,376
Okay...

192
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:25,323
Kind of feels like one.

193
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,736
You said you wanted to eat out, right?

194
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:32,324
I said yes, doesn’t mean
we signed a contract.

195
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:34,154
Why are you wearing lipstick?

196
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,555
I always wear lipstick.
Even when I’m doing laundry.

197
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,353
Are you always like this?

198
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,833
Like what? Honest?

199
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,418
Nonchalant.

200
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:47,770
Yuck.

201
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,590
First of all, I hate that word.

202
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,510
Second, I’m not nonchalant.

203
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,513
I’ve just had a lot of
experiences like this.

204
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,581
I’ve met a lot of your kind.

205
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,503
But you’re here now.

206
00:26:05,185 --> 00:26:08,771
You know, I dated someone
like you once.

207
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,570
All charm, all swag,

208
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,900
said he didn’t believe in love.

209
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,534
Thought he was so cool.

210
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,953
So, what did you say?

211
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,587
I said, I hope
one day you feel it,

212
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,589
then get left behind.

213
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:32,670
Is that what you’re doing now?

214
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:36,409
This is enough.

215
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,210
You know what, Raf?

216
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,732
You’re not a bad guy.

217
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:46,932
But you’re ignorant.

218
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:51,834
People like you don’t realize
how many hearts you’ve hurt.

219
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:55,289
Maya!

220
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,156
Maya, wait!

221
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,826
Maya!

222
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,830
Maya!

223
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:08,088
Maya!

224
00:27:10,465 --> 00:27:11,675
Maya, wait, please!

225
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:18,513
I know I probably seem
like I’m just smooth-talking you.

226
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,533
It’s what I do.

227
00:27:22,256 --> 00:27:26,343
Say some sad boy,
or confident guy line—

228
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,081
some made-up story just to

229
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,775
get the girl to come home
with me. But—

230
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,054
But?

231
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:37,630
But now—

232
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:41,607
I don’t wanna talk just
to sound cool, Maya.

233
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,151
I wanna be real.

234
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,040
Yeah, I’m a coward.

235
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,581
Scared of rejection.

236
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:52,582
Scared of commitment.

237
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,981
Scared that maybe...

238
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:58,283
I’m actually just a worthless guy.

239
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:00,535
So...

240
00:28:01,224 --> 00:28:02,684
I stuck to hook-ups.

241
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,000
Kept it casual.

242
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,315
No attachments—

243
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:09,561
so it wouldn’t hurt.

244
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,790
No fights.

245
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,248
Nothing to lose.

246
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:17,378
But now...

247
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,036
I want to try.

248
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,674
I want to try, even if I fail.

249
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:32,631
Raf,

250
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:37,049
if you just want to have sex,
just say it.

251
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,005
No need to sugarcoat it.

252
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:41,806
I’m not hard to talk to.

253
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,983
Especially if I like the person.

254
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,351
Or if I’m into them.

255
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,142
So… what now?

256
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,645
What do you mean, “what now”?

257
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,272
I mean—

258
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,192
Us. What are we now?

259
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,153
We don’t have to put a label right away.

260
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,281
But if that’s what you want...

261
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,784
Raf.

262
00:32:35,338 --> 00:32:36,506
There is no “us.”

263
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,545
Huh?

264
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:42,182
But… I thought...

265
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:46,529
It was fun, right?

266
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:49,879
I felt that, too. But...

267
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,353
there’s no “us.”

268
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,245
Okay?

269
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:57,824
Wait. I don’t get it. I don’t get it.

270
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:02,512
That’s fine.

271
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:04,413
You don’t have to understand.

272
00:33:10,385 --> 00:33:11,595
You’re not used to this, huh?

273
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:13,830
To what?

274
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,621
A woman who’s not buying
what you’re selling.

275
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,058
Unfair.

276
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:23,283
Unfair?

277
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:29,973
Raf, your whole life,
you’ve treated people like checkpoints.

278
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:34,742
Collecting experiences
instead of looking for something real.

279
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,932
And now that you’re finally
feeling something—

280
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,731
you think it has to mean
something right away?

281
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,901
I just thought…

282
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,362
But...

283
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:48,515
things are different now.

284
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,541
Maya, I’m tired of pretending.

285
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,131
I’m tired.

286
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,268
I don’t want to be

287
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:01,987
the guy you think I am anymore.

288
00:34:04,346 --> 00:34:05,431
Raf...

289
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,306
Maybe you can be different,
just not this time.

290
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:10,936
Not with me.

291
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:14,679
Not when you’re just chasing
what you think feels real.

292
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,818
Maybe we were meant to be…

293
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,253
Meant to cross paths…

294
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,273
but that’s it.

295
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,823
We’re not meant to walk
the same road together.

296
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,906
Hi, Ma.

297
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:57,088
Wow! You’re up early, huh?

298
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,124
Of course.

299
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,600
I was thinking I’d help you cook,
but turns out you’re already eating.

300
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,536
Come on, eat.
Grab yourself a plate.

301
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:06,588
Okay.

302
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,980
I missed your cooking, Ma.

303
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:15,486
Go ahead, eat up.

304
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,012
You okay?

305
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,008
Honestly, Ma...

306
00:35:27,488 --> 00:35:28,489
I don’t know.

307
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:31,167
But maybe that’s a good sign.

308
00:35:32,773 --> 00:35:33,816
Oh, by the way, Ma!

309
00:35:34,224 --> 00:35:36,143
I’m applying for a job tomorrow.

310
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,803
- Wow.
- Like a real job. I promise.

311
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:40,412
Not just drinking.

312
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,766
I just realized, Ma...

313
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,294
I don’t want to be
the old me anymore.

314
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,273
I want you to be proud of me.

315
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
Son, just learn how to cook first.

316
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:59,449
Even just that...
I’d already be so proud of you.

317
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,674
Alright, alright.

318
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:03,092
- Yes, Mom.
- Eat up!

319
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:37,892
Hi.

320
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:41,214
Sorry, just noticed something...

321
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,826
You were here the other day, right?

322
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:46,387
Yeah.

323
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:50,022
You were sitting near
the window, right?

324
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:53,080
You were drawing
something on a tissue.

325
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,506
- I was just bored.
- You looked super focused.

326
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,802
Didn’t think anyone would notice.

327
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,599
I notice a lot of things. Sorry.

328
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,856
Like what?

329
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:20,106
Like people who stare out
the window for too long...

330
00:37:21,604 --> 00:37:26,269
Or those who leave
without finishing their food.

331
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,689
Is it your thing to watch
what strangers do?

332
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:39,003
Not everyone. Just the ones
who look like they’ve got secrets.

333
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,302
- I’m Maya, by the way.
- Ella.

334
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,137
Ella.

335
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,056
Got time?

336
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,351
- Another round of coffee?
- Sure.

337
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:55,911
My drink was too sweet.

338
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,400
I prefer bitter.

339
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,485
Perfect, I’m bitter.

340
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,238
Nice...

341
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,869
So, is it better?

342
00:38:09,638 --> 00:38:10,681
Way better.

343
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,125
I don’t really trust people

344
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,502
who drink sweet coffee.

345
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,840
Well, I guess don’t trust me then.

346
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,970
So, what do you do?

347
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,514
Photographer.

348
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,933
Sometimes freelance.

349
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,187
- Sometimes, weddings.
- Wow. Romantic.

350
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,274
Not really. Promise.

351
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:42,236
But at least I feel like
my life has some purpose.

352
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,196
What about you?

353
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,033
I archive old stuff.

354
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,674
Photos, videos...

355
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,849
- I do restorations too.
- Hm...

356
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,332
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

357
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,545
But sometimes it’s kind of sad...

358
00:38:59,948 --> 00:39:03,614
You know, like you’re looking through

359
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,541
memories that aren’t even yours.

360
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:08,637
But still... you look anyway.

361
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:12,087
Well...

362
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:15,138
We all look.

363
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,065
So, Ella—

364
00:39:19,713 --> 00:39:22,674
is it your thing to
chat up strangers?

365
00:39:23,787 --> 00:39:24,788
No.

366
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,554
Just you.

367
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,220
I’ve got a quick Zoom meeting.

368
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,904
Go ahead.

369
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:47,941
I need to go back to my apartment,
my laptop’s there.

370
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:51,937
It’ll just take about 15 minutes.

371
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:53,816
Want to come?

372
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,931
Okay, sure.

373
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,395
Nice.

374
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:03,173
Wait, let me just grab my stuff.

375
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,458
The client wouldn’t stop talking.

376
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,129
Aren’t all clients like that?

377
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,215
Sorry about that.

378
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:29,831
Took a little longer than I thought.

379
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,179
It’s fine.

380
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,809
You could’ve gone home...

381
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,145
but you stayed.

382
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,313
Thanks.

383
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,152
It's our first time meeting,
and I already brought you home.

384
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,489
You probably think
I’m up to something.

385
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,534
Why?

386
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:55,327
Don’t you?

387
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,539
Why...

388
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,121
is it okay if I do?

389
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,173
Depends.

390
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:09,053
Depends on what?

391
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,864
You’re intense.

392
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,107
I don’t usually do this.

393
00:41:24,268 --> 00:41:25,519
Good.

394
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,360
I’m not into “usual.”

395
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,531
What do you want, Ella?

396
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,451
I want to know...

397
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,037
what you taste like.

398
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:54,352
Hi Ella, it's Maya.

399
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,303
I felt a connection last time.
What about you?

400
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:01,546
Can we meet again soon?

401
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,028
Cheers!

402
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:23,926
- We’ll be right over there.
- Alright.

403
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:34,907
Do you know the WiFi password?

404
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,722
Are you really asking,
or are you flirting?

405
00:46:40,143 --> 00:46:41,144
Both?

406
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,158
You’re really used
the WiFi as a move...

407
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,912
You okay?

408
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,315
Do you know that guy?

409
00:46:58,605 --> 00:46:59,648
Who?

410
00:46:59,788 --> 00:47:02,104
- The guy at the counter.
- Oh.

411
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,359
He looks like
he’s every girl’s ex.

412
00:47:08,045 --> 00:47:11,132
- So he’s a player, huh?
- Exactly. What a waste.

413
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
Can I bum one?

414
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,113
Actually... I don’t smoke.

415
00:47:47,146 --> 00:47:48,564
So why’d you ask?

416
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,409
I don’t know.

417
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,578
Saw you at the bar earlier...

418
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,289
Is this how serial killers flirt?

419
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,588
Do I look like a serial killer?

420
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,173
Just kidding.

421
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,011
- What’s your name?
- Ella.

422
00:48:09,669 --> 00:48:10,670
Javi.

423
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:14,469
So, Javi, what are you doing
out here being all mysterious?

424
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,487
What about you?
Why are you here?

425
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:20,010
Hunting girls.

426
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,734
But you ruined it. I hate you!

427
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:29,616
This is my first time.

428
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:33,104
- Smoking?
- Hitting on a guy.

429
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:37,157
My whole life,
I’ve only been with girls.

430
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,001
But I started thinking,
maybe that’s not really me.

431
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:44,169
There’s just something
about guys I don’t vibe with.

432
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,341
They’re kind of loud.

433
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,800
Chaotic.

434
00:48:50,268 --> 00:48:52,960
What happened?
You seem so open now.

435
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,222
Hmm...

436
00:48:54,502 --> 00:48:58,089
If I’m gonna try this,
I want it to be real.

437
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,432
Not just because someone dared me,
or it’s on a bucket list.

438
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,297
Are you nervous?

439
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,092
Should I be?

440
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,635
I don’t know.

441
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,805
Me? A little.

442
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,179
I’ve slept with lots of girls,

443
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,396
but with a guy,
I don’t know...

444
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,690
The feeling’s different.

445
00:49:46,723 --> 00:49:47,974
The energy’s different.

446
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,656
Feels like I have to
give something up.

447
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,202
But with you, it doesn’t feel like that.

448
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,082
I don’t know.

449
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:01,929
I can’t explain it.

450
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,336
You don’t seem like the type
to take advantage.

451
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:10,422
Like you’re actually willing
to meet halfway.

452
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:11,996
Geez...

453
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,428
You know, I’m not really in a rush.

454
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,764
We can just talk for now.

455
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:21,195
I don’t really wanna just talk.

456
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,292
So...

457
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,713
- It happened?
- Yup, it did.

458
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,125
You okay?

459
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,949
I enjoyed it, but...

460
00:53:41,974 --> 00:53:43,007
But?

461
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:44,617
This really isn’t for me.

462
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:46,937
You mean being with a guy,
or being with me?

463
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:48,658
Both.

464
00:53:49,046 --> 00:53:50,735
This really isn’t for me.

465
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,103
So... now what?

466
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,190
You want coffee?

467
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:57,208
Sure.

468
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,198
It hurts!

469
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,326
It hurts!

470
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,206
You’re probably...

471
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,918
going to be pissed at me again
for all the shit I’ve done.

472
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:18,145
Especially since...

473
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,682
I still think about you all the time.

474
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,850
Especially when I’m smoking.

475
01:00:34,981 --> 01:00:36,065
Lila!

476
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:37,642
- Javi?
- What are you doing here?

477
01:00:37,992 --> 01:00:39,577
- What are you--
- What are you doing here?

478
01:00:41,206 --> 01:00:44,296
I hang out here
whenever I go out.

479
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,434
What about you?

480
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,217
Ah... nothing.

481
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:50,275
Just needed to think.

482
01:00:52,342 --> 01:00:53,375
So, what's up?

483
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,570
Lila, I’m sorry. For everything.

484
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,823
How long’s it been?

485
01:01:01,897 --> 01:01:02,940
Since what?

486
01:01:03,546 --> 01:01:04,630
Since she was gone.

487
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:07,518
It’s been a year.

488
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:10,600
You’re still waiting?

489
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,840
Some people never come back, Javi.

490
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,976
Even the ones who are still alive.

491
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,183
Don’t you go disappearing too, okay?

492
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:37,673
You ever feel like...

493
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:41,288
you were born into the wrong life?

494
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:42,777
All the time.

495
01:01:43,304 --> 01:01:45,348
Like...

496
01:01:46,849 --> 01:01:49,572
you took a wrong turn somewhere,
and now you can’t go back.

497
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:56,379
And it’s like everyone else knows
what they’re doing, right?

498
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:00,883
Like they’ve all read some
guidelines we missed.

499
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:04,396
Or maybe they’re just
better at pretending.

500
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:10,841
I remember you used to be
the life of the party.

501
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,687
What happened?

502
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:14,442
Got tired?

503
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,724
Are you okay now?

504
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:21,293
Sometimes.

505
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:24,446
But at least it’s not all the time.

506
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:26,536
At least.

507
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,369
At least.

508
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:32,210
I don’t know where I’m going.

509
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:37,991
Same. But I guess that’s okay too.

510
01:05:58,528 --> 01:06:00,280
You seem different.

511
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,124
So do you.

512
01:06:03,181 --> 01:06:05,725
You think we can still fix this?

513
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:08,136
I hope so.

514
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,384
But I want to try.

515
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,991
What are you doing?

516
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:22,150
Same old stuff.

517
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:23,826
You know...

518
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,530
sometimes “happy endings”
are overrated.

519
01:07:31,988 --> 01:07:35,449
Sometimes, going back to
the beginning isn’t so bad.

520
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,807
There’s just something about this bar.
