1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,160
I want to kiss you.

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,280
I’m his younger brother.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
I know him better.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
The first wish I want to ask from you.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,600
No matter what I give you, must accept it.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,040
But...

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
This is too much.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,840
Nothing is too much for my Armin.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,800
He’s definitely coming back today.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,880
Just don’t take your eyes off him.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,920
Have you seen this news?

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,240
Rising Star Takes Shortcut, Trails Personal Photographer
What Happens Behind the Scenes Is a Mystery?

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,520
Do you trust me?

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,800
What will you do?

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,480
It’s time for us to uproot these people completely,

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,880
so they can’t mess with you like this again.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,760
Wenai, is everything handled?

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,640
Khun Janine, wait, what’s going on?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,680
What time will you be here?

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,200
- What time will you be here?
- Everyone, please stay calm. Just stay calm.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,720
Listen to me.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,400
If the press sees the two of us together,
you’ll become even more of a target.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,039
Trust me.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
I’ll trust you.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Go out there and tell the truth to the press.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,200
I’ll handle everything else.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
Brave to be a purple cow.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,280
You have to make up an unnatural story
instead of running away or denying it like others,

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,360
but I want you to accept the whole truth and fight back.

30
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
He's still not there? Seriously?

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,280
Ugh, fine. That’s all.

32
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
You have no idea what flight he’s on.

33
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,680
Ugh, how would I even know Crown’s flight schedule?

34
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,360
Even when I wanted to get rid of him,
I had to do it thru outside sources.

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Then don’t you wonder
who tipped off the press?

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,320
Everyone wants to get rid of him, Mom.
They’re all sick of him.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
Why would I bother?

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,160
I hope when I return,
I won’t have to clean up after you again.

39
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,200
Mom, seriously? Stop talking
or you’ll miss your flight.

40
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, take good care of yourself.

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,920
Please calm down, Armin will be here soon.

42
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,000
What time will you be here?

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,080
- What’s going on?
- What time will you be here?

44
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,320
Please calm down.

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
Look! That’s him, right.

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
That’s him!

47
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,400
Armin, may we have a moment for an interview?

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,480
Please, calm down.

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,280
- Mr.Armin!
- Have a moment for an interview?

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,760
Please, calm down.

51
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,600
He’ll answer all your questions,
but please stay calm, everyone.

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
It’s alright.

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,520
I’ll answer all your questions.

54
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,280
How do you respond to the photos
that have been leaked?

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
Can you tell us about
your relationship with Mr. Charlie?

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,320
Are you homosexual?

57
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,880
it’s quite strange.

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
I was photographed without permission.

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,320
Besides not being protected,
I ended up as the victim.

60
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,160
What do you mean by that?

61
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,800
However, I understand and will respond
to every question directly.

62
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
I don’t deny it.

63
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
I did go to see Mr. Charlie at the studio.

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,680
Because he invited me to do a photoshoot.

65
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,480
There was nothing inappropriate between us.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But the photos that were leaked
were intended to ruin my reputation.

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,400
And he didn’t just do this,

68
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
not just to me.

69
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,960
Who is it? Can you tell us?

70
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Mr. Ren.

71
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
Mr. Ren.

72
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
How is Mr. Ren involved in this?

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,159
What does Mr. Ren have to do this?

74
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,720
- Why?
- Can you give me more details?

75
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,360
It’s time to expose and eliminate them all.

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
They won’t be able to mess with you like this anymore.

77
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,240
The first plan is…

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,080
Brave to be a purple cow.

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,040
You just want to stand out from the crowd.

80
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,640
You have to make up an unnatural story
instead of running away or denying it like others,

81
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,600
but I want you to accept the whole truth and fight back.

82
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,440
No one thought a small star like you
would dare to fight against Stardaily.

83
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
You must do what others dare not.

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
Society is waiting to attack you.

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,280
They have no idea you're about to strike back.

86
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,600
Mr. Ren intended to harm me ever
since the perfume photoshoot.

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,760
The media under his control
became a weapon to destroy me.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,400
He destroyed my reputation
and that of other actors caught in false rumors.

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
Aren’t you all surprised?

90
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,480
Why does Star Daily Report

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,640
keep releasing damaging rumors about
many rising stars, over and over?

92
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
Do you have any evidence to support that, Mr. Armin?

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,560
Yeah, exactly!

94
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,600
At lease show us the evidence.

95
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Had no one been violating my rights and waiting
around like this, the news would be out by now.

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,280
I believe someone has already reported this to the police.

97
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Report to the police?

98
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,400
- What did report to the police about?
- Can you give me more details?

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Police have confirmed in a statement
that Armin’s interview was truthful.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,040
Ren has been behind the leaks that damaged
the reputations of many actors.

101
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,120
And he’s been constantly harassing Armin all along.

102
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
What the heck is this?!  Argh!

103
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
This is insane!

104
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
Hello.

105
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,640
Hello Ren, we are going to
cancel tomorrow's commercial shoot.

106
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,520
Huh?

107
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,200
Hey, sir, that’s not possible.
I’ve already booked and locked all the slots.

108
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,040
Alright, I get it.

109
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,360
Missing one gig won’t kill me. Whatever you want.

110
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,960
Muay, Mauy.

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,040
It’s you.

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,080
I gave a statement to the police
and submitted proof that Ren hired the paparazzi.

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,679
I’ve given both the police and the press the details about
the harassment of Mr. Armin on the perfume shooting day.

114
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,880
I truly want to apologize to you, Mr. Armin, about that day.

115
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,920
You did the right thing.

117
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,320
But I’m scared of Ren’s mother who owns
the biggest entertainment magazine.

118
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,200
- I’m afraid...
- You’re with Crown now.

119
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
You have nothing to worry about.

120
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,160
I can't believe Mr. Tada snatched up Ren's manager.

121
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,000
Mr. Tada is well aware of what I want.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,920
Honestly, I’m really not that good of a person.

123
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,520
I simply can’t keep working with
someone who lacks morals like this.

124
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,040
And I want to help you too, Mr. Armin.

125
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,160
Thank you once again, Mr. Tada, for helping me.

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,720
Wenai, kindly escort her to the lounge to rest.

127
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,200
Please come this way.

128
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,680
Thank you for your plan.

129
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,880
I’m not doing this just for you.

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,000
But I’m also doing it for our entire industry.

131
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,200
Mom, do something!

132
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,600
They’ve suspended me from all my work.

133
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,000
I don’t know what to do, Mom…

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
I just want to be an actor.

135
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,440
I can’t even save myself right now.

136
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,080
More than half the sponsors have pulled out.

137
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,040
And Crown might sue me.

138
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,400
You’re going to bankrupt me.
Are you even aware of that?

139
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,920
Didn’t you say you had a plan? Where is it now, huh?

140
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
It’s Tada, Mom! He’s the one who framed me.

141
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,440
I’m begging you stop messing things up any further.

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
Okay.

143
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,280
I know exactly how I’m going to handle this.

144
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Hello.

145
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
H.. Hello.

146
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,400
Ren.

147
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,160
What do you want?

148
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,360
Well… um… here’s the thing…

149
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,200
I want to apologize.

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,280
It wasn’t on purpose this morning, I swear.

151
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,440
The whole thing… it was just my own emotions.

152
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Um… I’m really sorry.

153
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,400
It’s just… if you could please give me a chance?

154
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,600
Can you please tell Mr.Tada not to press charges
and put my mom into bankruptcy.

155
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,200
This is just...a small misunderstanding. It’s my fault.

156
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
It doesn’t matter who did what for whom.

157
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,440
But It was you and your mother
who committed those evil acts.

158
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,720
Wait...

159
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,000
Are you telling me you’re not going to help me?

160
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
I’m helping.

161
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,960
I’m helping others not to be bullied by people like you.

162
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,480
Hey!

163
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,600
Damn it.

164
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,720
You should probably stay at my place tonight.

165
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
Is that him? Where is he?

166
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,800
Did he exit that way or this way ?

167
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,840
Try zooming inside.

168
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,120
Damn!

169
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Get in.

170
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
It’s you again.

171
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
This time, I think you should reconsider your answer.

172
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,160
Because by now, you must know
what you’re messing with?

173
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Yes.

174
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
They ruined my life.

175
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,640
But you still have a chance to win this game.

176
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,040
Fine!

177
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,720
I’ll work with you just to get back at Armin and Tada.

178
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,760
Damn it.

179
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
Good evening.

180
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,440
Welcome.

181
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,960
I’m glad you’re here with me.

182
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,160
Come in.

183
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Hot News: Mr. Ren is currently holding
a press conference on the matter.

184
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,040
Let's tune in.

185
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,080
What made you decide to expose Armin and Charlie?

186
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,040
Exactly. You intended to frame Armin, didn’t you?

187
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
- How so..
- Please clarify.

188
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
Did you slander him?

189
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,640
Hold on, listen up.

190
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Armin isn’t the saint you think he is.

191
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
- How so?
- What’s so bad about him?

192
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
The reason he’s still standing is because
he’s Tada’s favorite sponsored sweetheart.

193
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Huh?

194
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
Tada? You mean the president of Crown Enterprises.

195
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,320
Isn’t that risky?

196
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,280
Saying stuff like that without fear of being sued?

197
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,920
Why’s that?

198
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Is there any proof?

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Aren't you afraid of being sued?

200
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,520
I don’t say anything without evidence.

201
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
- Hell yeah!
- If you don’t believe me, go ask them yourself.

202
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,160
-  Haha! You made the right choice, Ren.
- He really did use sex to trade for fame with him.

203
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,920
This is exactly how we win.

204
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,040
Do you actually have any proof?

205
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,960
Welcome drink here you are.

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Aren’t you stressed at all?

207
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,320
To be honest, I’m really stressed.

208
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,880
That sugar baby rumor is hurting you and Crown right now.

209
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,280
It’s not just any sugar baby scandal… it’s a guy.

210
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,840
It’s not that I’m against same-sex stuff.
It’s just people out there still aren’t okay with it.

211
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,560
Don’t worry about it.

212
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,920
Ren’s credibility is already falling apart.

213
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,400
Soon enough, it’ll be nothing more than a rumor.

214
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,200
Scandals only make people more curious.

215
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,400
And if they find out about us you might get into trouble.

216
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I don’t want you to have a hard time because of me.

217
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,600
I’ve got something urgent to handle.
Please wait here for me.

218
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,880
And don’t worry, everything will get better soon.

219
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
Mr. Thiwthit, I’ve got word from an inside source

220
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,240
every newspaper is running
a scandal about Mr. Tada tomorrow.

221
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Crown’s going down for sure this time.

222
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Of course Star Daily started it.

223
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,880
But come on who’d dare mess with Crown.

224
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,920
Everyone can find courage if we give them enough.

225
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
Is it going to be worth it?

226
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,280
If you don’t dare to make the trade, you’ll have to die.

227
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Star Daily doesn’t want to go down alone.

228
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,360
They want to take their enemies with them.

229
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,800
Are you coming back yet?

230
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Look to the opposite side.

231
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,920
What do you want me to look at?

232
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,960
Outside the balcony.

233
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
What do you want me to see?

234
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
I’m going to start counting now.

235
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,200
3...2...1...

236
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,600
Turn on the lights.

237
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,800
Do you like it?

238
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
I hope this will help you feel less stressed.

239
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,320
I love it.

240
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,360
You know, there’s only one thing
that can really stress me out.

241
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,520
That is seeing you unhappy.

242
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,960
Is this the urgent matter you were talking about?

243
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,560
Well, I just want you to be happy as soon as possible.

244
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,280
Right now, we might not be able to go public yet.

245
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,960
Because of work and social matters.

246
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,240
But with TD , you can always be yourself.

247
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,480
TD loves you , Tada loves you too.

248
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,080
I want to see you shine as the brightest star.

249
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,120
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

250
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,680
♫ Like a book already written ♫

251
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,760
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

252
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,360
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

253
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,520
♫ The day I found you ♫

254
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,280
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

255
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,080
♫ It was fate that drew the line, making me love you ♫

256
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,800
♫ I believe that ♫

257
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,440
Now I know why I hit reset,
Why I came back to life again?

258
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
So that I could find your love.

259
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,560
♫ Even if the story were different, ♫

260
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,440
♫ I think we'd still be the same ♫

261
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,400
♫ Nothing would change ♫

262
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,360
♫ Even if I turned back time and start over countless times ♫

263
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,960
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

264
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,640
♫ Every time I meet you ♫

265
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,240
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

266
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,320
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

267
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,520
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

268
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,760
♫ The moment I look into your eyes ♫

269
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,560
♫ Believe me, I will love you the same ♫

270
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,840
Crown has stayed silent and unaffected
by those damaging rumors.

271
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,520
I knew it.

272
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,920
You know about the media you hired, right?
They’ve sent someone here.

273
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,360
If we can’t pay them on time, they’ll expose you.

274
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,120
And target Venus instead.

275
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,920
- How should we handle this?
- Can you just stop talking for a moment?

276
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,840
Go tell them...

277
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,520
I’ll pay on time.

278
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,520
Send the bill and make them leave.

279
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,680
GO!

280
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,600
Alright, then please follow up on the tasks I assigned.

281
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,960
I’m here to ask back the shares of Crown
that were once given to Venus.

282
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,360
That share? You already used it
to trade for the MD position at Venus.

283
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
How can you just ask for it back so easily?

284
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,160
I know, but I have a way to make
Venus grow even more by using Crown’s shares.

285
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,000
How?

286
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,760
I will use Crown’s shares to pressure Crown
into accepting Venus as part of the company.

287
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,480
We will attract talented people
and amazing artists from Crown.

288
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,560
Just by doing this, we will gain a bigger market share.

289
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,320
Are you interested?

290
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
As you know,

291
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,400
right now 30% of Crown’s shares
are in Venus’s hands.

292
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,800
That’s almost half, you know, Mr.Tada.

293
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,720
What do you want?

294
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,400
I want Venus to become a part of Crown.

295
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,320
We will collaborate, manage together,

296
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,360
and grow side by side.

297
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
And what if I say no?

298
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
You wouldn’t say that,

299
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,160
because you know
how important that 30% stake really is.

300
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,600
If I sell it to your enemies who are everywhere,

301
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,160
Crown will be in big trouble.

302
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,760
Am I right Mr. Tada?

303
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,160
Wenai.

304
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,800
Where is Mr. Tada?

305
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,520
Tada is in the room talking with
the Venus representative.

306
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Is it Thiwthit?

307
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,240
The Venus CEO.

308
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,560
- In past life, 2015.
- Since Crown teamed up with Venus,

309
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,680
- In the period after Crown Enterprise merged with Venus.
- Since Crown teamed up with Venus,

310
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,520
- In the period after Crown Enterprise merged with Venus.
- things at Crown have gone quiet.

311
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
Every show they put out just bombs, losing big time.

312
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,040
While Venus hits number one
in ratings every time.

313
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,720
And they even manage
to launch their artists internationally.

314
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
If Crown doesn’t step up and fix the game soon.

315
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,640
It won’t just be Crown going quiet,
it’ll be Crown fading away completely.

316
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,360
Armin, just a moment.

317
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Wenai, call a shareholders’ meeting.

318
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,520
We might have to let Venus join Crown.

319
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,480
Yes sir.

320
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,240
You must not do that under any circumstances.

321
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,520
You must not let Venus join Crown.

322
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
And you have to buy back
all the shares from Venus.

323
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,400
But the 30% shares cost a huge amount, sir.

324
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,920
Please tell me, why should I believe you?

325
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,560
In the future, Venus will cause trouble for Crown.

326
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,480
That’s all I can say.

327
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,400
I know it’s hard to believe, but please trust me.

328
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,560
I need more time to really think this through.

329
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,360
Tonight, all parties are fully
prepared for the Y2K crisis,

330
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,480
Counting down to
the millennium toward the year 2000.

331
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,360
You’re still working?

332
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
It’s New Year’s Eve.

333
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,920
I’m busy handling this coming
Millennium year thing, you know.

334
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,520
Everyone is scared of Y2K,

335
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,440
worried the virus will crash their computers.

336
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,720
I have to standby with the IT team.

337
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,120
I probably won’t get to countdown with you.

338
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,280
Trust me, tonight will pass
just like any other New Year’s Eve.

339
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Just another ordinary year.

340
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
How can it be ordinary?

341
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,080
I’ve heard rumors from many sources.

342
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640
That something bad is really going to happen.

343
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,320
How about this?

344
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Shall we make a bet?

345
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,720
If the Y2K curse doesn’t happen,

346
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,240
you have to do as I say.

347
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
Are you brave enough?

348
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,080
Sure thing.

349
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,640
I’ve never been afraid before.

350
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,360
Five Four Three Two One.

351
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,960
I’ll make your fears disappear myself.

352
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,880
Happy New Year.

353
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,160
See? I told you everything would stay just fine.

354
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,360
Mr. Tada Sir,

355
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,160
The IT team says everything’s back to normal now.

356
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,040
Okay.

357
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,000
Then please tell everyone,
they can go home and celebrate.

358
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,920
Yes sir.

359
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,800
You...

360
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,440
really came from the future, didn’t you?

361
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
You lost the bet to me.

362
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,080
You have to do exactly as I say.

363
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,800
What do you want in return?

364
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,440
I want you to buy up all of Thiwithit’s shares.

365
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,880
It’s not that I don’t trust you...but to be honest,

366
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,240
If we buy back the shares,
Crown will lose liquidity.

367
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
That’s a serious risk.

368
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,120
Just like how Y2K was supposed
to be dangerous, right?

369
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,480
And in the end,
nothing happened just like I told you.

370
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,800
This situation is the same.

371
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,640
If you bring Venus into Crown,
that’s what you should really be worried about.

372
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,280
Trust me on this… Mr. Tada.

373
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,960
I told you to negotiate
for management rights at Crown,

374
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,800
not to sell our shares to Crown.

375
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,480
If they won’t let me manage,
then I have to sell, right.

376
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,480
But you have no right to sell my shares.

377
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,120
Your rights ended the moment
you became MD of Venus.

378
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,720
The shares are mine,
and all the money is mine.

379
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,720
That’s my money.

380
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,200
I want all of it back.

381
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,560
Investment comes with risks.

382
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,280
You’re a businessman, aren’t you?

383
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,720
You should understand this rule well.

384
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,560
I think you need to reconsider
your moves on this board.

385
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,520
I’m watching closely to see
how you’re going to turn this game around.

386
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,120
Damn it!

387
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,080
You said you’d sink Crown.

388
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,040
Why is it still going strong?

389
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,840
But you and I are left with nothing no shares,
no money, nothing at all.

390
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,880
Oh!

391
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,960
What ?

392
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
What?

393
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
If you don't pay your debt,

394
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,360
I won't just send a photo,
but you who will become a corpse.

395
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,800
What the hell is going on here?

396
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,480
If I don’t get the money to them,
they’ll kill me for sure.

397
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,760
Mom… you have to help me.

398
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
God… What can I even do for you?

399
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,160
I don’t have any money left either.

400
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Shit!

401
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,200
Damn it!

402
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,480
Mom… can you mortgage the house?

403
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,880
I’ll use part of the money
to pay off my debt,

404
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
and the rest…

405
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,240
I’ll use it to get revenge.

406
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,840
I will take back everything
that belongs to me from Tada.

407
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,800
Are you out of your mind?

408
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,600
This house is the only thing I have left.

409
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,920
This is our last option…

410
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
unless you have a better idea.

411
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
Damn!

412
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,520
Are you sure that you can really pull this off?

413
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,880
Failure is not an option.

414
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,160
I have to do this.

415
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
Damn it!

416
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,000
It’s all because of Tada.

417
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,920
If he wasn’t around,
everything would be so much easier.

418
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
After Tada graduated and returned from abroad.

419
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,440
- After Tada graduated and returned from abroad.
- Our images look great together, bro.

420
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,040
The heir to the Crown empire.

421
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,120
Just imagine, if we team up,

422
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,960
no one can take down Crown.

423
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,280
You just say what you want,
and I’ll make sure you get it all.

424
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200
I don’t want anything from you.

425
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,080
And it’s better to not pretend we’re family.

426
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,520
But if you want Crown Enterprise
to be what my father dreamed of.

427
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,320
Then you should know what matters most.

428
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,480
The sole Chief Executive Officer of Crown will be...

429
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
Mr. Tada.

430
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,720
Hey!

431
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,040
That’s not true.

432
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,040
I’ve worked hard for what’s mine for so long.

433
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,760
There’s no way he can just swoop in and take it.

434
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,320
I won’t accept this.

435
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,080
You should respect my father’s decision.

436
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,320
Don’t think that running Crown is that easy.

437
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
The board doesn’t trust a kid like you to handle things.

438
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,440
If I fail to meet my father’s expectations,
and the board loses confidence in me.

439
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm willing to give up this right if I fail.

440
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,360
But if I can bring Crown back to
being number one in this country,

441
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,720
then you and your son must stay out
of Crown’s management forever.

442
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,120
If I can’t have it,

443
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,720
then neither can you.

444
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:54,400
No matter how far apart we are, do you feel it too?

445
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,560
Someone’s been waiting,

446
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,120
Hoping love will return.

447
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,640
When knowing it’s time to say goodbye.

448
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:15,120
Oh darling, I’m ready to confess my love.

449
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
Bravo!

450
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,960
The song you just sang was really beautiful.

451
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,680
Hello, Thiwthit.

452
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,680
I came here because I have a good proposal for you.

453
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,360
Your account balance is insufficient.

454
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,960
Please top up.

455
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,880
Who are you calling?

456
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,520
I’m getting jealous, you know.

457
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,000
Who?

458
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,280
Calling Auntie Jeed.

459
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,120
Uh, hey, can I borrow your phone for a sec?

460
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,240
I forgot to top up mine.

461
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,400
Sure.

462
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,840
But let me take care of some business first.

463
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,480
Wenai, please top up Armin’s phone.

464
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,000
Hmm… let’s say...

465
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,280
a hundred thousand.

466
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
That’s too much.

467
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
Wenai said the exact same thing as you.

468
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,400
Then top it up with the maximum amount possible.

469
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,680
I’m done with my business.

470
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,840
You can use the phone as you like.

471
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,000
I’m kinda jealous of you, you know that, right.

472
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,840
Only Aunt Jeed is allowed.

473
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,160
'Min-Min' is that my name.

474
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,160
Hey you.

475
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,240
Hey you.

476
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,960
Min-Min.

477
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,560
No peeking, okay.

478
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,360
Too late now, but Min-Min already saw it.

479
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,280
Min-Min’s sorry.

480
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,160
Hey!

481
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,120
I know you’re teasing me.

482
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,760
But why do I feel like I actually like it?

483
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,160
But what about mine?

484
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,000
What did you save my name as?

485
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,560
I just saved it as your normal name.

486
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,000
I’m gonna go take this call first.

487
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,120
Excuse me,

488
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,480
please let Min-Min pass.

489
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,040
Make yourself comfortable,
but your phone’s right here.

490
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,920
You even saved my name as just ‘Tada’.

491
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,120
So cold, aren’t you?

492
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm sorry.

493
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,000
Let me reset your name.

494
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,840
There.

495
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,520
Are you happy now?

496
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,880
That should be more than enough, 'Darling'.

497
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,920
I'm happy now Min-Min.

498
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,920
Here you are.

499
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,280
Wenai , If it’s not important, you’re dead meat.

500
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,720
Then I won’t be dying anytime soon,
because this is something really important.

501
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,120
Thiwthit officially introduces Narin
as the new artist of Venus Entertainment.

502
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
It’s such a pleasure that
the two of us get to work together.

503
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,320
Why was Mr. Thiwthit able to bring Narin
to join Venus Entertainment?

504
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,760
Well then, why don’t you
ask him in question directly?

505
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,360
I have full confidence in Venus.

506
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,200
Even though Venus is a smaller company than Crown,

507
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,680
I’m confident it will bring me more
happiness than Crown ever could.

508
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,440
Does that mean you weren’t happy at Crown?

509
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,560
So, was there a problem with Crown?

510
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,000
Is there anything you’d like to say to Crown?

511
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,840
Was there a conflict between you and the company?

512
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,320
Well, your move to a new label
has really become the talk of the town.

513
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,520
Now do you believe what I said?

514
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,560
I’m going to show the world
just how foolish Tada was.

515
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,800
To let someone as valuable as you slip away.

516
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,200
Bro, I need to talk to you.

517
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,400
In private.

518
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Go ahead.

519
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,240
Narin is one of us now.

520
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,480
How did you manage to pull a Mega star
like Narin away from Crown?

521
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,960
Just Narin’s songs alone
have captured a big share of the market,

522
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,640
and they’ve also increased
Venus’s stock value significantly.

523
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,200
I’m just letting them sacrifice a few pawns,

524
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,560
so I can easily capture the queen.

525
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,480
No matter how strong someone is,

526
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,920
everyone has a weakness, don’t they?

527
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,320
I just don’t understand
why Thiwthit had to do that?

528
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,560
He wants to destroy me.

529
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,560
- But he’s your younger brother.
- He’s not even same the blood as mine

530
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,320
Just the son of Dad’s new wife.

531
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,560
Since Dad remarried,

532
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
he brought that woman
and Thiwthit into our lives.

533
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,320
You really don’t like it, do you?

534
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,920
The presence of that woman
and Thiwthit, is a reminder that...

535
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,720
Dad betrayed Mom and me.

536
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,840
I’ve been trying to keep them away
from managing Crown anymore.

537
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,720
So he took revenge
by using your secret relationship.

538
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,680
I don’t think this is just a game anymore.

539
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,720
Thiwthit is serious.

540
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,800
I just want to see
how he’s going to play this game?

541
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,360
Don’t just have fun, be careful.

542
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,400
Keeping a snake so close,
one day it might just bite you.

543
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,120
What's up Phat?

544
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,560
What? Auntie Jeed fell.

545
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,920
Which hospital is she at?

546
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,120
Okay, I will meet you there.

547
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,920
I’ll go with you.

548
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
You should be here.

549
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,120
Everyone’s watching us right now.

550
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,600
It’d be better if we don’t go anywhere together.

551
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,200
But...

552
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,800
I’m begging you, please.

553
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,760
I don’t want to be a weak spot for Thiwthit to hurt you

554
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,600
Armin.

555
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,440
I don’t want to be disappointed again.

556
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,040
I don’t want to be anyone’s toy anymore.

557
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,320
Please don’t leave me.
