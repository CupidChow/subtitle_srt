1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
In past life, 1999.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,800
Such a clueless little rookie! Haha!

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,680
Silence!

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
I, myself, will take revenge… even if it means my life!

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,880
CUT.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,560
What the hell is this nonsense?!

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
Hey assistant, give them a quick brief, would you?

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,320
Armin! Dude, what the hell are you doing?!
You need to have some inner fire, man!

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,960
Speak clearly and with conviction not all weak and whiny like bleh bleh bleh!

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,160
Say you line again…Shut your mouth!
I will take revenge on all of you with my life if I must!

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,280
Enough already.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,920
Wei Nai.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
You know how to handle this, right?

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Uh!!!! What???

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,039
As someone who's always been by Armin’s side,
all I want is to support his dreams. That’s all I need.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,160
I hope the gift I gave will be helpful to him.

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,720
Practice reading aloud, listen to your own voice.
TD, your fan club.

18
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
How could you do this to me?

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,440
All because of you.

20
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,840
What year this is?

21
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,200
It’s 1999.

22
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,960
I rose from the dead, back in my own body.

23
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,800
I need to find the answers to this rebirth of mine.

24
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,520
You... the one who helped me before.

25
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
Aren't you going to introduce yourself?

26
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
I'll tell you when we meet again.

27
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,920
One drink, please. I really like you.

28
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
Drink up! Drink up.

29
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
This feeling... it’s...

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
Armin….

31
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Armin….

32
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,080
How did you end up here?

33
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
It’s because of you.

34
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Wanna come in for a swim?

35
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Or are you scared?

36
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,280
In this life, I have nothing left to fear.

37
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,320
Now can you tell me.

38
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
What we’re both doing here?

39
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
Hey... Don’t you remember anything?

40
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:00,640
You were so drunk and vomiting, so I brought you here.

41
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
It’s strange,

42
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,400
Why is it always you who helps me?

43
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,080
Is all of this is just a coincidence.

44
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,400
Or is this your intention?

45
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,280
I just want to protect you.

46
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,160
To keep you from harm.

47
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,920
Can this be called destiny?

48
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Here…try some wine?

49
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
My name is Tada.

50
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,360
If this is really a return in time,

51
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,240
then why didn’t I meet you in my past life... Tada?

52
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,360
Domain Jean Yves Biso Etcheso Grand Cru

53
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,600
It was discontinued in 2016.

54
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
Due to the economic crisis in Europe.

55
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,799
It tastes pretty good ,too.

56
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
At that time in my life,

57
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,600
I never got to taste anything this good.

58
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,920
And I’ve never met you before.

59
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,800
Can you tell me now, what is it that you really want from me?

60
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,040
You seem different too.

61
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,560
You’re talking about something that hasn’t even happened yet.

62
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,840
You’re not like the Armin… I know.

63
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,960
Have we met before?

64
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,640
When?

65
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Are you hiding something from me?

66
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
Hey, how about you just tell me now.

67
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Why did you show up and save me right
when I was about to get hit by a car?

68
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,080
And you even said you were staying in the same area as me?

69
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
What are you doing around here?

70
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,840
I live around here too.

71
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,880
And then again today, tell me, why do I keep running into you so often?

72
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,920
Are you following me?

73
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,560
But it's strange...

74
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,040
Even though I don’t know anything about you.

75
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,000
When I’m around you, I feel...

76
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
Familiar in a way I can’t explain.

77
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,560
Then it must be like...

78
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,080
How I’ve always felt this way about you.

79
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Who are you, really?

80
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
Ugh…!!!

81
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,560
My head hurts like crazy.

82
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,680
Sir…

83
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,440
Sir…

84
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Hey Phat...

85
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
Enough already.

86
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,360
You’re here?

87
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,760
I thought I was gonna die.

88
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,880
One too many, right?

89
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I think that shop owner must've secretly drugged me.

90
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,840
They definitely tried to kill me.

91
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,000
My head hurts like crazy.

92
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,440
I think that shop owner must've secretly drugged me.

93
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:50,040
If my death wasn’t an accident, and the symptoms
I had before falling from the balcony were from being poisoned,

94
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,800
then someone intentionally tried to kill me.
Who was it that wanted me dead?

95
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,680
I’ve traveled back in time to the year 1999.

96
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,120
Is it an accident or a murder?

97
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,680
Was I poisoned?

98
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,760
And by who?

99
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,640
Who did this?

100
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,040
Charlie.

101
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,360
Sam.

102
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,200
Lily.

103
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Achi

104
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,600
Ren.

105
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Phat.

106
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,320
Or Mr. Tada.

107
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Tada.

108
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,360
I hope you're just a stranger.

109
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,000
I hope we’ve never met.

110
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,680
Because the people who have come into my life
have all been the ones who betrayed me.

111
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,120
I’m very interested in your company, Venus.

112
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,320
And I’m confident that I can help Venus grow to the next level.

113
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
Let me be the MD of Venus, and you won’t be disappointed.

114
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,560
Another heir of Crown Enterprises is interestedin Venus this much.

115
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,280
It’s an honor.

116
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,440
I have a proposal for you.

117
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,840
You’re interested in buying a significant stake in Venus.

118
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,120
Is it because you want Crown to have no competition?

119
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,360
I actually want to be Crown’s rival.

120
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,400
Venus is a good tool that will show everyone that...

121
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,640
How capable I am.

122
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:22,520
And I will make Venus an entertainment company that is great enough
to surpass the number one rank, Crown Enterprises.

123
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,840
Thirty percent of the shares in Crown will be one incentive.

124
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
There you go. There's no need for you to hesitate any longer.

125
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,880
What answer do you want from me?

126
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
I want to hear that...

127
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,320
I would like to take one night to reconsider your offer, Mr. Thiwthit.

128
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,520
Wait, Mr. Thiwthit, you’re giving me something special? Haha...

129
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,880
A warm welcome to Mr. Thiwthit, officially the new MD of Venus.

130
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,760
Thank you so much, Lily.

131
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,360
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you so much.

132
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,720
Please have a seat.

133
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,760
And this is the profile folder of the talents under our management.

134
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,480
It also contains each of their contracts.

135
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
I didn’t ask for this.

136
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,840
But I have to say, it’s well thought-out.

137
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh… haha…

138
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,560
Well, I’ve been in this industry for a long time,
so I know what needs to be done.

139
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,800
I personally take care of all the talents,
as well as the various tasks in the company.

140
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,520
I handle everything myself.
If there's anything you need or if something's missing,

141
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,119
just let me know, Mr. Thiwthit. I’ll take care of it. Haha.

142
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,880
Okay.

143
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,599
Each of these talents has an impressive background.

144
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
For example, this one is about to release a new single,

145
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,079
and the next one is involved in a huge film project.

146
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,760
I like rooting for the underdog.

147
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Huh?

148
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,599
Do you know why?

149
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,040
Because when they turn things around and win,
it feels insanely satisfying.

150
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Oh, you don’t need to pay attention to this one. Just an extra.

151
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,600
I don’t even know what I was thinking when I signed him.

152
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,960
Total troublemaker, feel free to overlook him. Haha…
Let’s look at the next one instead.

153
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
Looks familiar… like I’ve seen him somewhere before.

154
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,560
Mr. Thiwthit has become the MD of Venus,

155
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,320
a business in the entertainment media just like Crown,

156
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,120
and has just snatched the actor we had our eye on
to sign a contract with them.

157
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,040
This is the shareholder report,
containing important information about Venus.

158
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,880
It's strange, though, that the board of directors
gave this position to Mr. Thiwthit,

159
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,280
despite him having no prior management experience.

160
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
The board of directors of Venus
consists of my father's old associates,

161
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,720
who had a falling out over profit issues in Crown.

162
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Thiwthit is just looking for new allies.

163
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,760
But if these people team up and manage
to get Mr. Thiwthit, who is the heir of this place.

164
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
Crown Enterprises may face a bigger problem
than they've ever dealt with before.

165
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,440
All these pots and pans...
Ugh, scattered everywhere, blown all over the place.

166
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,200
Thanks so much, young man.

167
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,560
In the past life.

168
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,120
Phat.

169
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,240
Just leave, you asshole Min!

170
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,640
Go back!

171
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,040
I said go!

172
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,520
Get out of here!

173
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,320
I told you to leave.

174
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,360
Take it easy.

175
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
Just go!

176
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,320
Don’t greet her.

177
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
Just go.

178
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,040
I told you to leave!

179
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,120
If I had come to see Aunt Jeed sooner that day,

180
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
I probably wouldn’t have to live with this much regret.

181
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,800
Ar.. Armin.

182
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
What’s gotten into you, huh?

183
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,560
Did you forget to shake the bottle before taking your meds?

184
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Or have you just gone completely loopy
from shooting movies and dramas?

185
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,320
Aunt Jeed!!!  It’s really you!

186
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
Of course it is!

187
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
What’s the matter this time, huh?

188
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,320
You're not dead!

189
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,800
Hmm... take that... and that!

190
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Ouch. That hurts.

191
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,720
Fine, I’ll hit you so it hurts, so you’ll know I’m not dead, not a ghost.

192
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,600
But I could hit you dead too.
I’ll beat you until the dog comes out of your mouth.

193
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,440
Hey…Phat…..Phat.

194
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,120
What is it, Auntie? I’m literally helping you with the grill fire right now.

195
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Oh…don’t worry about that now. Come here. Look over here!

196
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,800
Get Armin off of me, please...

197
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,720
- Ugh, he’s making it hard to breathe!
- Don’t think too much about it, Auntie. He’s been acting weird lately.

198
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh wow... Just leave that and come help me first!
I can’t breathe right now, damn it, Phat!

199
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,920
He’s squeezing so tight light a python!

200
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,640
Min!

201
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Min!

202
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Auntie, did you secretly put cannabis leaves in the stir-fried basil?

203
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,000
Why is he eating it as if it’s the best tasting basil stir-fry ever?

204
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
Are you saying my cooking isn’t good?

205
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,960
Salty.

206
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,920
- Hmmm.
- Oops.

207
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
Watch your mouth!

208
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
I really miss your stir-fried basil cooking the most.

209
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,240
I have to say that I miss you more.

210
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,680
I’ve been wanting to visit you for many days now.

211
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,960
You're usually disappearing all the time.
What dreams are you chasing?

212
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
Why did you come back?

213
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,800
It's because they stopped hiring you, right?
You're out of a job, aren't you?

214
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Ah, and this one the long drama with lots of dialogue you mentioned,

215
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,120
will it be aired? Which channel is it on? Channel 3?

216
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,280
In the past, I was just a background character. No one remembered me.

217
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,400
But after the incident that brought me back,
everything is about to change.

218
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,520
What the heck is he rambling about?

219
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,560
Lately, he's been a bit off like this, Aunt.

220
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
Wait….Stop.

221
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
What the heck is wrong with you!
You scared me half to death, you crazy kid!

222
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,000
What, what, what?

223
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,400
Leave that dish, Aunt. You need to stop eating salty food,
or you'll end up with kidney disease.

224
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm not threatening you,
but it's true, you actually have it.

225
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
Aunt, aren't you afraid of dying?

226
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,480
Don't you want to stay with us until you're old?

227
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,800
If I eat salty food and I’m happy, then I die happily,

228
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,640
I’m not afraid. It doesn’t cause trouble for anyone.

229
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,160
But if you think that if I eat bland and tasteless food,
I’ll become immortal,

230
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,960
then try to think like me.

231
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,200
What if I don’t die from kidney disease but walk out
onto the street and get hit by a car?

232
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:57,280
Think about it. So, I’ll choose to be happy every day, fully,
so I don’t have any regrets.

233
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,160
Auntie, for now.

234
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,160
Just reduce your sodium intake.

235
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,560
Phat take this away.

236
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Hey…both of you are in this together!

237
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,120
Hey... alright... Let me tell you about
what it's like to betray someone who helps you.

238
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,360
Can I have some money for food, please?

239
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,200
Hey, don't look at the camera, don't look at the camera.

240
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,280
Don't look at the camera.
Yes, move out of the frame, move.

241
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,080
Hey, hey! Oh, hey! Hey, it's raining! Hey, it's raining!

242
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,800
Hey! Unplug the lights, unplug everything first!

243
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,640
Hurry up, it's raining! Team, move!

244
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,760
PR team, take care of the stars,
take care of the actors. Quick!

245
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,440
Congratulations, Mr. Armin.

246
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,240
Why are you looking at me?

247
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,200
Pharit.

248
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,920
It's really you.

249
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,120
No, you’ve made a mistake.

250
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,400
Actually, I am supposed to meet you in two months from now.

251
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Is everything really changing?

252
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,840
What are you talking about? Let go!

253
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,960
I told you to let go!

254
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
- Hey.. Pharit!
- Hey it’s really him.

255
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,720
Ahhh can I have an autograph?

256
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,680
Wait a minute. Please come back, Pharit.

257
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
Can I have your autograph, please?

258
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Hey you!

259
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,560
Hey you!

260
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,600
Let go.

261
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,880
Why are you following me?

262
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Are you crazy?

263
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,160
Do you know that you've ruined everything?

264
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,760
I think I was  pretending to be
a homeless person pretty well until now.

265
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
How did you recognize me?

266
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,840
Don't you remember me?

267
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,880
Because we aren't supposed to know each other yet.

268
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
I mean, the time when we should have known each other.

269
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,680
Then why are you following me?

270
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,200
So, who are you, exactly?

271
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,240
We will eventually know each other.

272
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
And one day, we will be rivals.

273
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,640
In the past life.

274
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,800
How could they do this to me?

275
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,640
From the beginning, the media has set me and Pharit up as rivals.

276
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
It's you again.

277
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Whatever work project that casted Pharit,

278
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,000
I was never a part of.

279
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,160
We've never worked together even once.

280
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,320
Rivals?

281
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,920
Are you crazy?

282
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,760
I don't even know your name yet!

283
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm Armin.

284
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,360
Your approach to people is unbelievable.

285
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,280
But sorry, I’m not interested in getting
to know people who crave attention.

286
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,000
And you do realize that.
I’m filming a hidden camera show right now, right?

287
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
Are you just trying to hitch a ride on my fame?

288
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,440
In that case, I guess you got what you wanted.

289
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
You can look forward to reading the news tomorrow.

290
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,440
If I was poisoned before I died,
there must have been something in that bottle of wine...

291
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
Or Pharit and Ren could be working together to hurt me.

292
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,280
I remember being really impressed by you as an actor,

293
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,560
and I’ve always wanted to be like you.

294
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,600
Why did you want to sabotage me so much?

295
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,720
You and the others, you intended to harm me.

296
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Didn't you? Didn't you?

297
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
Hey!  Stop!

298
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,440
- Mr. Pharit. Mr. Pharit.
- Are you crazy?

299
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,520
Mr. Pharit.

300
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,840
Oh, I'm sorry, we're filming a show right now.

301
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
Could you please give us some space?

302
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,160
I'm sorry.

303
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,280
Uhhh, Mr. Pharit. We really apologize.

304
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,240
Ouch!

305
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,720
So sorry. It was raining and we didn’t look after you appropriately.

306
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,920
The events of the past are starting to change,

307
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,840
as if what happened before,
before I died…time rewound and is now happening again.

308
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,800
Those people, those events everything is about to unfold faster,

309
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,760
or there’s something different this time.

310
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,400
Just yesterday, a leaked photo surfaced of Pharit,
the rising star and lead actor from the stage play Romeo and Juliet,

311
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,920
- seen with Armin, an unknown background actor,
- Have you seen the news yet, sir?

312
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,680
running away from fans.

313
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,120
I thought they were close friends!

314
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,960
But according to our sources,
Pharit doesn’t even know him personally.

315
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,360
It looks like Pharit has run into
a clout-chasing extra trying to leech off his fame.

316
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,760
Let's take a closer look, dear viewers,
at the background of this so-called leech.

317
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,520
I just became the MD, and there's already drama?

318
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,080
If you see our kid as a leech,

319
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,280
then they’ll think Venus is the one
encouraging that leech to latch onto celebrities.

320
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,240
What kind of management is that?

321
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,720
Letting a scandal like this happen?

322
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Oh please. I’ve been doing everything I can to manage him

323
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,080
but does he ever listen to me?

324
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
All he does is stir up trouble.

325
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,360
He can’t even act, always disappearing from set.

326
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,160
And now this scandal. I honestly don’t know
how to get through to him anymore.

327
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
If he’s beyond teaching at this point.

328
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,360
Then just tear up his contract and let him go.

329
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,280
I don't want any troublemakers getting
in the way of Venus’s growth and progress.

330
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,560
Yes Sir.

331
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,320
How did you end up in the news with Armin?

332
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,520
By now, that Nostradamus must be celebrating.

333
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,360
Looks like we'll meet again, just like you said.

334
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,200
Is your mind and brain deteriorating or something?

335
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,480
Is that why you're doing all these disgraceful things?

336
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Pharit's manager will take action against us.

337
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,400
You're causing so much damage to Venus.

338
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,720
The executives are going to fire you.

339
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
And what about my contract?

340
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,280
Contract?

341
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,720
The contract states that you are not allowed to cause damage
to the company, and you've already done that.

342
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,280
They're going to fire you. Get ready to be
the troublemaker somewhere else.

343
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,240
Go!!!

344
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I told you to go! Why aren't you leaving yet?

345
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,240
Leave!

346
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,600
You’re the jinx!

347
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
Do you know how unlucky I am to end up with you?

348
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,320
You're the worst, a total liar.

349
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,840
Ahh!!!

350
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
Your management skills are terrible,
yet you still take a big percentage from my pay.

351
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,200
Hey you.

352
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,160
-  You… How dare you!?
-  What?

353
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,040
What? Say it, go ahead.

354
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,840
Say it!

355
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,720
You! You dare to insult me?

356
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,280
I came back this time to get revenge on people like you,
who pretend to be kind but stab you in the back.

357
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,120
Do you understand?

358
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,800
That damn contract is just a trap to deceive others.
Even artists who don't know any better end up caught in it.

359
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,400
And remember this, now that I'm back,
you’ll never get anything out of me again.

360
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,680
You damn people.

361
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,240
How dare you insult me, you fool!

362
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,440
Go ahead and eat it!

363
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,440
Go stuff your face.

364
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,280
Eat it!!!

365
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,960
Yeah..Eat it..

366
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,640
You like it don’t you? Eat it all.

367
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,160
You know you like this!

368
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Tastes good, doesn’t it?

369
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,800
Armin.

370
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,520
Armin.

371
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,680
Armin.

372
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
Armin.

373
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,400
Armin.

374
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,360
Armin.

375
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,160
Where did you go? Earth to Armin.

376
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Sign the contract cancellation document.

377
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
I'm not signing.

378
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,120
The fact that I’m in the news with Pharit,
Venus should be thanking me.

379
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,680
Every newspaper, every news outlet is covering this story.

380
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,040
Venus has been talked about more,
and it has turned into a trend.

381
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,760
Think about it, how much money does
Venus have to invest in promotion.

382
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,480
Just to make an unknown actor like Armin become well-known?

383
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,760
I've always done everything on my own,

384
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,080
including this time.

385
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,120
Think carefully.

386
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,360
I can benefit you and the company.

387
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,960
I want to remain with Venus' contract.

388
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm sorry for everything I've done wrong.

389
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,840
Huh.

390
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,560
What kind of ghost possessed you?

391
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,960
I have to stay strong, because I know that if I break
the contract with Venus, I will face the consequences.

392
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,320
Why can't I get into the casting?

393
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,960
- In the past life.
- Well, you got blacklisted.

394
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,440
You tore up your contract with Venus.
Who would dare hire you?

395
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,200
And another thing,
Your credibility is completely ruined now.

396
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,160
I think you should just leave, okay?

397
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,680
At that time, I was kicking dust with no work for a year.

398
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,520
Almost ready to give up on the industry.

399
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,840
Okay.

400
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,800
You don't need to cancel the contract,
but you have to apologize to everyone.

401
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Apologize to the executives, apologize to Pharit's manager,

402
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
and apologize to the show as well, understand?

403
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,120
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

404
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,840
No need to apologize.

405
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,280
When I think about it, it's just a coincidence, right?

406
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,680
I'll try to talk to the higher-ups for you.

407
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,320
I mean... sometimes the media
and the public just overreact... Oh!

408
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,640
They might be overthinking it. Don't worry,

409
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,000
I'll go speak to the higher-ups
and tell them you're not at fault.

410
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,960
I should have known you were
this kind of person from the start.

411
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,560
Then I wouldn't have to face that kind of ending.

412
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,960
Well... you don't have to cancel it.
Don't sign any documents.

413
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,600
I'll talk to the higher-ups. I'll take care of it, don't worry.

414
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Do you understand? You can relax now.

415
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,840
I can handle this, it's not a big deal at all.

416
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,080
Armin.

417
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,520
Even if I could go back and choose a different path,

418
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,320
the outcome would still be the same.

419
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,240
Does that mean no matter which path I choose,

420
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,040
my end result will always be the same?

421
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,199
May I sit here?

422
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,440
You again.

423
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,679
You seem troubled.

424
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,600
If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.

425
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,840
I don't think you could ever stand my predicament.

426
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,480
You could never help me.

427
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,719
But for this matter, I think I can help you.

428
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,240
Even though I may not be able to ease your worries,

429
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,920
I’m sure I can help satisfy your hunger if you allow me to help.

430
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,040
Is this your way of asking me out for a meal?

431
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,440
Got it, Sir.

432
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,720
Find me the phone number of the best restaurant in Bangkok asap.

433
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
Uhhh…okay.

434
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,080
I need the dishes from this menu to make
this meal an important one for my boss.

435
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Hey…Hurry up…come on let’s go…Let’s go.

436
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,040
I Don’t got all day. Let’s go.

437
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,840
This is Duck Confit, a duck leg from the thigh,
cooked using the sous-vide method

438
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
and then roasted to a crispy exterior and tender interior.

439
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,760
It is served with our restaurant's special side dishes.

440
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,160
Enjoy your meal!

441
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,160
Thank you so much Chef Alan.

442
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,000
Do you know the chef?

443
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,520
How could I not know?

444
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,880
He will be very famous in the future.
He even has his own TV show.

445
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
Are you a fortune teller?

446
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,440
How would you know that the chef will have his own TV show?

447
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
It's not just a TV show.

448
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,320
He also has a YouTube channel and streams online too.

449
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,840
You...

450
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,120
What are you talking about?

451
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,600
Things in the future.

452
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,640
From now on, the world is going to change very fast.

453
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,080
There's going to be digital TV, but don't go
get involved with that. A lot of people will go bankrupt.

454
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,200
And there will be dozens of streaming platforms popping up.

455
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,720
From now on, people will watch movies online, not on TV anymore.

456
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,760
Okay.

457
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,360
I'm not really sure what you're talking about.

458
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
One day you’ll understand!

459
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,320
But for now, let’s just enjoy the meal.
You're right, it all looks delicious!

460
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,000
I thought you said you were hungry?

461
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,880
Aren't you going to eat?

462
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,360
Just looking at me won't fill you up, you know.

463
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,000
You, with the way you speak
and what you’re saying. I really can’t believe it!

464
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,120
It’s just the same way you spend your money.

465
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,400
But if the way I spend money can make you feel more at ease,

466
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,920
I'm happy to do it.

467
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
You know?

468
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,280
With the news being that big?

469
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm not a leech clinging to a celebrity like the news says.

470
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,000
I know.

471
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,040
But others don't know, and they probably
don't even care to know the truth.

472
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,080
I had to lower my dignity and apologize for something
I wasn't even wrong about.

473
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,600
It was so humiliating.

474
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,920
Why did you do it?

475
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,280
It's to make sure I have work in the future, you know.

476
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,280
Being an actor isn't easy at all.

477
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,520
In that case.

478
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
I believe you have dignity.

479
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,840
You have dignity and you respect yourself a lot.

480
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,960
Which is why you're willing to do things
you don't like in order to follow your dreams.

481
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,240
I respect you for that.

482
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,000
Those words make me the happiest I've felt all day.

483
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,760
Thank you...Tada.

484
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,320
Hello.

485
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Hi.

486
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,440
This is Lily of Venus.

487
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,480
Yes, you want one of our talents to audition for a movie?

488
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,600
Which one is it?

489
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Wow!!

490
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,000
That's such a big project!

491
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,200
Don't worry, I'll pick one of best talents for you.

492
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,360
What?

493
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,960
Who did you say you want?

494
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,400
Uh..Armin…mmmm okay.

495
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,360
I’ll let him know. Thank you so much.

496
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,560
Good bye.

497
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm late!

498
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,200
We’re going to get this job!

499
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,280
Yes Ma’am.

500
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,520
Oh,

501
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,640
Knock  Knock Knock.

502
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,640
Hello there Sis. Chad.

503
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Hello.

504
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
I brought a young, new talent from Venus to auction.

505
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,080
This is Achi.

506
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,040
Happy Loy Kratong Day Ma’am.

507
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,520
Hello.

508
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,360
These are delicious honey tangerines.

509
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,560
Uh... but the name on the casting list says Armin.

510
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,720
Armin…

511
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,760
Oh he wasn’t interested
in the part so I brought Ashi instead.

512
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,360
He’s much more talented. Believe me!

513
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,600
May the deities of these waters bless me with good business today.

514
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,400
Oh..

515
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh…the wind is so strong today!

516
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,440
I pray for really good business.

517
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,320
- Auntie Jeed.
- Oh my!

518
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,840
Oh…Armin.

519
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,400
Where have you been all this time showing up now?

520
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I've finished setting up the shop, can't you see?

521
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,480
Auntie… better late than never.

522
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,400
And today, Phat isn't here either.

523
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,080
You’ll have to rely on me alone,
so stop complaining, it gives me a headache.

524
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,480
I'm the one who should be saying that I'm getting a headache with you.

525
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,600
It's good you came.

526
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,880
Be useful and go buy me some soy milk.

527
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,240
Buy my usual.

528
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,280
Sorry.

529
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,760
I apologize.

530
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,880
Please give him one moment.

531
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,200
He'll be back shortly.

532
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,720
What's up, Director Liu?

533
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,760
Mr. Tada, Armin hasn't arrived yet.

534
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,000
Huh?

535
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,720
He hasn't come yet?
And where is he now? What happened?

536
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,560
I don't know either.

537
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,160
But if Armin doesn't come, I won't be able to do
what you’ve requested, Mr. Tada.

538
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I must apologize, Sir.

539
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,840
Excuse me.

540
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,040
Mr. Tada, Sir.

541
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,960
You can't miss this important meeting, sir.

542
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,360
But helping Armin is the most
important mission for me right now.

543
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,760
It seems like Mr.Tada is head over heels in love.

544
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,160
Not yet.. Thank you.

545
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,640
Ma’am, two bags of soy milk please.

546
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,160
I want all the toppings and make it less sweet please.

547
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,480
Oh…you’re so handsome, Son, Are you a leading actor?

548
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,200
In the future, Ma’am.

549
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,680
Ahh…Show me what you like, I’ll put in a little extra for you.

550
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,400
- Please do…add a lot!
- Okay.

551
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,000
Do people still float their krathong offerings like this nowadays?

552
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,080
People have been floating them like this for a long time, my dear.
How else would you expect them to float?

553
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,800
Ahh..nevermind… Less sweet please.

554
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,120
Okay, less sweet it is.

555
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,480
Hey, Don't you know what you're supposed to do today?

556
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,040
Um…to drink this soy milk?

557
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,280
Today, you have an audition,
so come with me right now. Let's go.

558
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,640
Wait, I can't go, I need to help Aunt Jeed and...
I still haven't gotten my soy milk.

559
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,480
I'll take care of that, but you need to come with me.

560
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,680
Otherwise, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

561
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,520
Hey you…eh.

562
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,520
Trust me just this once in your life.

563
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,840
Uh…Aunt, save those soy milks for me later.

564
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,480
Where are we going?

565
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,600
Get in the car.

566
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,160
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it right away.

567
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,200
Excuse me, everyone. Excuse me.

568
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,600
Mr. Tada just called and told me
to cancel the meeting for now.

569
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,880
Because I need to go buy soy milk.

570
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,960
Huh???

571
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,640
No. I mean I must tend to an important task
that’s just come. Meeting adjourned.

572
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,640
Meeting adjourned. Thank you very much.

573
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,880
Everyon, meet at the soy milk vendor, NOW!!!

574
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,720
Wait a minute.

575
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,760
To be honest, I'm really confused.

576
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,680
What movie am I supposed to audition for?

577
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,560
And why is it so urgent? And... how did you know?

578
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,160
This is not time to ask questions.

579
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,120
You have to go now!

580
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,240
Oh!!!!

581
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,720
Why is this so difficult to light?

582
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,840
Here we go….it has to be like this.

583
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,120
- Ma’am.
- Oh my!!!

584
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Here is your soy milk.

585
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,800
We are all here on behalf of Admin.
We are here to help you.

586
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,240
Please take this.

587
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,360
Thank you.

588
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
What can we do to help, Ma’am?

589
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,200
Well... then, first, could you please... take these soy milks
and put them in the back of the shop?

590
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
They’re quite heavy!

591
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,440
Is there anything else you need help with?

592
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,800
Uh... here it is. I’ve been trying to light the incense,

593
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,160
but no matter how many times I try,
it keeps going out. It's just...

594
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,600
Come on.

595
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,360
- Let’s go Team!!!
- Yes, sir.

596
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,160
Hey…block the wind.

597
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,240
Ma’am, Can you move a little.

598
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,840
How about here?

599
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,920
Yes, block the wind a bit.

600
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,560
Ahh, yes yes..let’s all help.

601
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,960
This place is...

602
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,800
This is not the time to find answers.

603
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,320
Go to the audition right now.

604
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,800
The audition for the movie "Deep Depths"
was the day I first met Sam.

605
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,440
Is there something wrong?

606
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,880
I...

607
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,400
feel something, but I'm not sure what it is.

608
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,240
Are you okay?

609
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,960
I don't want to go in there at all.

610
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
It doesn’t feel right.

611
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,760
Here…This is my good luck charm.

612
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,000
I carry it with me at all times.

613
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,640
When I feel uneasy,

614
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,320
it helps.

615
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,720
Okay…I will go.

616
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,840
And then I will come back to find some answers from you.

617
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,360
Hey you.

618
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,240
Hey you over there.

619
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,360
Are you here to audition for the film Deep Depths?

620
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,080
Please go have a seat over there for now,
and I’ll call you when it’s time to sign in.

621
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,720
Um... excuse me,

622
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
are you here to audition too?

623
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,960
I’m Sam.

624
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,560
In my past life, the audition day
for the film Deep Depths, in the year 1999

625
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,000
Excuse me.

626
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
You're here to audition too, right?

627
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,360
Yes.

628
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,920
It's just that... I only found out about this today,
and I didn’t prepare anything at all.

629
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
Could you help me out, please?

630
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,240
Uh…I’m Sam…

631
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,960
What’s your name?

632
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,000
Excuse me...come and sign in now.

633
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,640
Oh hey…come back and sign in first.

634
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,440
The person I trust as my lover,
and my best friend who I think of as a brother.

635
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,880
Just a few hours ago, you pretended
to be so innocent in front of me.

636
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,440
In my past life, the day the cast
was announced for the film Deep Depths.

637
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,360
- In my past life, the day the cast
was announced for the film Deep Depths.
- Congrats! You got your first movie role!

638
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,720
Don’t forget me when you’re famous, okay?

639
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,280
Aw, come on!

640
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,880
How could I ever forget the one
who helped me when I needed it most?

641
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,480
Please show me the ropes
and give me good advice, ok?

642
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,920
I'm sorry, bro, that you didn't
make it through the audition.

643
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,000
If you need anything,
feel free to let me know.

644
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,360
Don't forget what you said.

645
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,400
And when do you start shooting for the Deep Waters film?

646
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,480
You mean Deep Depths?

647
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,200
Remember the film name at least.
It’s called Deep Depths.

648
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,240
And then Sam was chosen for the lead role,

649
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,000
while I remained a background actor
for many more years.

650
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,880
If God were to give me a chance to reset my life
and pursue my dreams again,

651
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,160
perhaps God wants me to go back in time
to settle the score with Sam.

652
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,080
I’ll take away what’s important to him,

653
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,280
just like he did to me.

654
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
I'm ready now.

655
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,720
I'm Armin from Venus Company.

656
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,080
Oh, it seems like Venus has sent
someone else to sign in instead you, Armin.

657
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,560
Who is that?

658
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,600
Achi.

659
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,240
The script is still quite similar, just a small change.

660
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,000
It's no big deal.

661
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,560
Director Liu, hello!

662
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,080
I’m Lily. I brought our new talent to audition .

663
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,040
Hello, I’m Achi from Venus.

664
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,320
Um...one moment.

665
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,360
I don’t believe I selected you to audition.

666
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,640
The person who was chosen has
caused trouble for you in the past, Pharit.

667
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,280
And right now, he’s under probation
from the company, so he can't come.

668
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,880
Does this mean Armin isn't coming then?

669
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:02,960
No he’s not coming.

670
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,560
I was hoping to meet him in the audition room.

671
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,760
Ready. Come this way.

672
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,120
Armin!!!

673
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,640
You’re Armin?

674
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,760
Finally meeting you in person!  Are you ready?

675
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,960
Yes.

676
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,760
If you're ready, I'll see you in the audition room.

677
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,640
See you soon.

678
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,240
Haha, finally here! Let’s go!

679
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,240
I thought we wouldn't get to meet after all.

680
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,560
Armin.

681
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,640
Why did you come here? Who brought you here?

682
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,960
Are you surprised to see me here?

683
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,320
You should have informed me that I have an audition.

684
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,600
You should be taking care of me,

685
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,280
not doing something inconsiderate like this.

686
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,240
But this is a co-production film between countries.

687
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,880
If I let you participate, it would harm their country's reputation.

688
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,520
And they have auditions too.

689
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,720
You’re not good enough.

690
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,680
So who brought you here, huh?

691
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,960
Did you ask permission to come?

692
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,440
Hmm... if you're not going to listen like this,
I might really have to tear up the contract.

693
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,840
You're basically ruining your future.

694
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,440
Let's go!!!

695
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,560
And now, I have the opportunity
to prove myself once again.

696
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,200
I won't let anyone stop my dreams
or ruin my life again.

697
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,400
I will define my own future.

698
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,600
In past life, On set of "The Throne Series"

699
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,320
Cut...

700
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,320
Who the hell are you, coming to act in my movie like that, huh?

701
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,760
It’s just a simple kick, and you still got your legs tangled.

702
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,840
So damn pathetic!

703
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,480
Can I try the kick again?

704
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,520
Enough. Enough already.

705
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,160
Hey! Reset the scene!

706
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,280
With acting like this we’re doomed!
Here look at this. Go!

707
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,720
I’m really sorry about before.
Please let me try one more time.

708
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,560
Oh my god... What the hell should I do with you?
Should I just kick you so you'll get better?

709
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,920
You should apologize to the whole crew
for wasting their time with you.

710
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,600
Everyone else is doing their job,
doing their best. What about you?

711
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,200
I... I’m trying to do the best of my ability.

712
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,280
This is all you can do?

713
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,400
Then you’ll act in secondary roles for the rest of your life.

714
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,360
But, Sir…

715
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,560
I want to be the lead role.

716
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,160
You the lead role?!  Pffft!

717
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,240
To be the lead, you need to have more than this, kid!.

718
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,520
Skilled. Roles are clear.

719
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,960
Ride horses, sword fight, box, do everything. And you?

720
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,160
You can’t do any of that.

721
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,320
Don’t dream too high, kid. You’ll just fall and get hurt.

722
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,200
I apologize again.

723
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,080
You know, you’re good-looking like God himself made you,

724
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,600
but I know why your contract is on hold
for so long, it’s because you suck.

725
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,840
Ugh, terrible!

726
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,720
Hey you!

727
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,360
Someone brought something for you.

728
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,320
Thank you.

729
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,160
Muay Thai Training School.

730
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,880
One day, your efforts will make you better.

731
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,280
We hope that this place will help you improve
and prevent you from getting hurt for no reason again. - TD

732
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:44,960
Sir.

733
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,600
What?

734
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,160
Who is the one who brought this to me?

735
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,600
How the hell would I know?

736
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,600
In my past life, no matter how painful it was,

737
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,560
'TD' was always by my side.

738
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,080
Hey geez.

739
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:21,360
Thank you for going out of your way
to take me to the film audition.

740
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,280
Thank you, Mr. Tada.
