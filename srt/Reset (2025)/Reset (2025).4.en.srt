1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,600
25 years from now.

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,000
I’ve gone back to the past
and been reborn in this body!

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,880
Is this some kind of sci-fi movie plot?

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,920
If I hadn’t been reborn,
I don’t think I ever would’ve met you.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,400
I believe it was our fate that brought us together.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
Is there something you're still hiding from me?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,680
When are you finally going to tell me?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,160
Suspend all of Armin’s work because
he went to the casting without informing Venus.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,480
Are you deliberately using the contract to bully me?

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,080
If freedom’s what you want,

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,800
then break the contract and pay the penalty.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,280
You’re my property under contract.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,400
Don’t forget it.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,720
Why are you toying with my life like this?

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,920
You showed up to give me a chance,
only to send your brother to destroy it.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
So, what is it you want from my life? Hmph!

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,880
So, it’s Thiwthit, huh?

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,759
Believe in your dreams.

19
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,360
Drink lots of water to ease your hangover.

20
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,200
Same as always! Ugh!!

21
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,560
He’s here!

22
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,279
You're here already?

23
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,839
I’m here to see Mr. Thiwthit.

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,360
It’s like you planned it.

25
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,840
Mr. Thiwthit, the person of topic has arrived.

26
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,720
Mr, Thiwthit, I have something
I need to discuss with you.

27
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Come in.

28
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
Well... Hello.

29
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,600
This is Janine, he will be your new manager.

30
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,640
Manager?

31
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,040
We meet again.

32
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

33
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,080
Yes.

34
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Uh….

35
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,520
But….

36
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Why are you changing my manager now?

37
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
Is this all your doing?

38
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,560
Can you stop with the questions?

39
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,720
I have business to take care of.

40
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,760
Leave.

41
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,320
Leave!

42
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,760
Uh..we can’t leave just yet…It’s just that….

43
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,880
There are some documents you must sign first.

44
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,159
Please sign this.

45
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,280
Tch.

46
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Thank you.

47
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
Come…Let’s go.

48
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,600
Please go.

49
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
- Hey.
- Huh?

50
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Explain to me.

51
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
What exactly happened?

52
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Why, all of a sudden, would someone like...?
So, you're one of Crown's people,

53
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,480
and now you're here, acting as my manager?

54
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,320
Calm down. First of all,
the only reason I'm here is because of Crown.

55
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,320
They saw your so-called acting ability during the audition.

56
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,840
But it was a closed audition,
so how could anyone from Crown have seen it?

57
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Hello...

58
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,159
Crown is still Crown.

59
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,200
No need to act confused,
because now you’ve got what you wanted.

60
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
You should be happy.

61
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,920
Crown sent me to be your personal manager.

62
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,040
So from now on, I’ll be handling everything for you.

63
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,640
You can now do whatever you want.

64
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,200
And the first job you'll be doing is...

65
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
Star in the film Deep Depths.

66
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,400
I passed the audition?

67
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,080
Yes.

68
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,840
Congratulations, Armin. You’re really talented.

69
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, feel free to speak casually with me.

70
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,200
We still have to work together for a long time.

71
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
And thank you for coming back to be my manager.

72
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Huh?

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,480
Wait a minute? What are you thanking me about?

74
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,159
I just became your manager.

75
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,840
Why would you thank me? I don’t understand.

76
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,800
Let’s just say thank you then.

77
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,520
It’s okay, you don’t have to thank me.

78
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,600
You’d better thank Crown instead.
Because they are my boss.

79
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,160
I have connections abroad.

80
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,880
The investors over there are interested in investing
in the entertainment business in Thailand.

81
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm about to make Venus huge, and didn’t we
already agree on the management authority?

82
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,840
So why did you still sell that actor to Crown?

83
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,040
You're making this much of a fuss over some
no-name background actor? Seriously?

84
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,480
But this! You should have consulted me first.

85
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,280
As a business partner.

86
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I still have the right to make certain decisions
in the company without asking you.

87
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,120
You and your brother are both trying to
snatch this background actor.

88
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,960
What’s so special about him?

89
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,200
Look…

90
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,000
Is Tada behind all of this?

91
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,400
I already know something.

92
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,600
If this were a business game,
how would you make your move to counter it?

93
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,120
Oh, damn it. Damn it.

94
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,920
If there’s no appointment, you can’t come in.

95
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,240
Move aside, you subservient.

96
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
It’s okay.

97
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Mr. Thiwthit must have an urgent matter,
which is why he forgot his manners.

98
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,280
This is how you want to play, huh?

99
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,120
You might think you’ve beaten me,
but this game isn’t over!!!

100
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,560
You think I don’t have the ability to do anything, right?

101
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Just a worthless background actor, huh?

102
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,720
But sorry, I’m going to make you regret it.

103
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I’ll make Venus surpass Crown,

104
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,080
and then you’ll know who
really wins this game, it's me!

105
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Mr. Thiwthit said all of this, and you're still
going to let him manage Venus?

106
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,080
I just want to know.
How he will make his next move?

107
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,000
You’re not acting like an older brother, teaching
your younger sibling how to play the game, are you?

108
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
But no matter what you plan to do,

109
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,640
someone like Mr. Thiwthit is not a weak,
defenseless child that you can easily handle.

110
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,120
I know this.

111
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,760
You do realize, don’t you, that making a move
like this won’t just shock Venus?

112
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,960
But the whole country is about to start
wondering who exactly is Armin,

113
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,680
and why are two major companies
fighting over him like this?

114
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,840
I know.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Because that was my intention.

116
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,600
Can I ask to meet you this evening?

117
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Mr. Armin?

118
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
Mmm…Yes.

119
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
Hmm... do I have anything else scheduled after this?

120
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,080
No...

121
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,680
I got this.

122
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
Willing to pay.

123
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,640
Tore up the contract just to be near him.
My boss really goes all in.

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,080
The Battle for Armin, an actor
who once made headlines with Pharit.

125
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Between Venus, Armin’s former agency,
and Crown Enterprises.

126
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,680
So what’s the deal with Armin?

127
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,400
Crown dropped a serious stack of cash
to rip up his contract with Venus

128
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,120
and snatch him up for their own roster even though
Crown's already bursting at the seams with A-listers.

129
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,000
There’s more insiders are whispering that,

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,840
could it be a sibling showdown
between Tada and Thiwthit?

131
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,080
Thiwthit just stepped into
the role of top exec at Venus,

132
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,000
and now big bro Tada’s swooping
in to steal his thunder?

133
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,360
Come on in.

134
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
You’re the one behind this, right?

135
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,280
Mmm..Hmm…

136
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
Actually...

137
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,520
I can do much more for you than that.

138
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,400
Are you hungry?

139
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,600
I made some noodles, so that maybe we can...

140
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,560
♫ Even if I turned back time
and start over countless times ♫

141
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,240
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

142
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,840
♫ Every time I meet you ♫

143
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,480
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

144
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,560
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

145
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,520
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

146
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,040
♫ The moment I look into your eyes ♫

147
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,920
♫ Believe me, I will love you the same ♫

148
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
Thank you.

149
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,200
For everything.

150
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,800
You are the gift in my new life.

151
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,280
You…

152
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
Aren’t you hungry?

153
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,680
I made these noodles just for you.

154
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,760
Go sit down and wait please.

155
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,840
No.

156
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,080
This is the time to return the favor Mr.Tada.

157
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
I'm gonna help.

158
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,240
Here it is.

159
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,080
Wow.

160
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,920
These noodles are gonna be
the most popular noodles of the future.

161
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,840
This recipe’s from my favorite spot over
on Banthat Thong Road.

162
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
But I haven’t been there in a long time.

163
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,720
Back then, it was full of teenagers and tourists,
way too chaotic for someone my age.

164
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,520
Alright, let me serve you a bowl.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
Looks delicious.

166
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,520
Try it.

167
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,480
Mmmm….

168
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,000
You….

169
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
This is too delicious.

170
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
Don’t go cooking this for anyone else.

171
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,520
This is my special recipe by you.

172
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,720
Mmmmm.

173
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,480
No promises.

174
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,520
Hey!

175
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,960
If you really come from the future,

176
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,960
how is the world different from now?

177
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,560
Hmm...

178
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,600
In the future, there will be so many amazing things to see.

179
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,840
Hey.

180
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
Look over there!

181
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,320
There will be a shopping mall,
with big buildings coming up.

182
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,760
And those billboards will turn
into something like TV screens.

183
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,280
Everyone will have their own TV in hand.

184
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,640
It will make everyone keep their heads down,
lost in their own world.

185
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,880
Sometimes, I feel like the world right now
is actually more fun.

186
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Eat up before it gets cold.

187
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,920
I really like this show.

188
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,319
It’s the show my dad and I love the most.

189
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,800
I still remember the last time we sat down to watch
our favorite show together, it was this one.

190
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,840
But...

191
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
It’s been many years since then.

192
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,520
Since...

193
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,720
before my father passed away.

194
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,160
In the future, this show will come to a close.

195
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,720
Doesn't it feel a bit heartbreaking to hear that?

196
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,640
Well, that's just how it is.
Old things go, new things come.

197
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,360
Nothing lasts forever.

198
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,680
Hey…you…enough already.

199
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
I know what we can do.

200
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
Let’s do something fun.

201
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,520
What?

202
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,040
TikTok.

203
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,280
Tik…

204
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
TikTok?

205
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,080
MmHmm.

206
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,000
Come on.

207
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,040
It's short video clips.

208
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
The younger generation calls it "content".

209
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,840
The younger generation really loves it.
It's super popular too.

210
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,120
Ok, well…What do I have to do?

211
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,720
You just set up the camera...

212
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll adjust the angle for you.

213
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Okay.

214
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Stay still and steady.

215
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,840
Count down 3 seconds for me.

216
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,760
3...

217
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,760
2...

218
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,240
1...

219
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,480
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

220
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,600
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,880
If you're happy and you know it,
then your face will surely show it.

222
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,680
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

223
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
Let me see. How is it?

224
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,200
Wait, be careful.

225
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,800
Now it’s your turn.

226
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,160
Come on.

227
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,120
Uh…ha

228
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,160
Ready?

229
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,600
Wait…

230
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,160
What do you want me to do?

231
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,720
Dance of course!

232
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,680
3…4...

233
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,640
- Wait…
- If your...

234
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,360
I can’t dance.

235
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
If your….Hey you.

236
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,360
Enough with that already.

237
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,280
In the future, there will be
Instagram, Facebook, and X

238
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,520
where people can post pictures and videos,

239
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
and write captions to express
how they feel at that moment.

240
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,200
What is it that you want to express
about how you feel right now?

241
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
What's the caption? What hashtags,
and who are they for?

242
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,960
Alright, you ready?

243
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,000
5..4..3..

244
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,480
2..1..

245
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,840
ACTION!

246
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,400
Hey Tada.

247
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,600
You're wasting both memory and batteries…hurry up….

248
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,600
5..4..3..2..1..

249
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,800
Go!

250
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,560
You are my artist.

251
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,160
No matter what you desire,

252
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,520
I’ll always take care of you
and support you in everything.

253
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Hashtag...

254
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
#ArminFanclub

255
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,720
Hey….you….

256
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,560
I wanted you to caption the clip I filmed of you.

257
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,440
Not turn it into something about me.

258
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,560
Thank you.

259
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,600
I will be the best actor I can be.

260
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
Make it worthy of the support you've given me.

261
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Mr. Chairman.

262
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
And what kind of…

263
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,160
Hashtag will you create?

264
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
Hashtag....

265
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
I wanna kiss you.

266
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,400
You’ve got it.

267
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
Hello Mr. Armin.

268
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,640
Hello.

269
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,680
Kindly have a seat and wait over here, please.

270
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
And this time.

271
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,000
I became an actor in Crown Enterprise.

272
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Mr. Armin.

273
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,120
Right this way please.

274
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,640
What do you think, after reading the script?

275
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,840
I think this story is really good.
It's very interesting.

276
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,360
And what about you?
What do you think of this story?

277
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,240
I think... because it's a big production.

278
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
The storyline is great.

279
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,240
I think it’s definitely going to be a hit.

280
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,200
I think so too.

281
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,040
Oh, Armin just arrived.

282
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,640
Ren.

283
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Pharit.

284
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,760
You’re here.

285
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,040
Oh! Armin.

286
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,440
Sam.

287
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,400
You’re late, huh?

288
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,280
Was there traffic?

289
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,840
No matter what, it seems like
we just can't avoid each other.

290
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,040
Armin?

291
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,520
Alright... everyone’s ready now.

292
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,120
Let's go.

293
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Come on, let’s go!

294
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,400
Here, I’ll hand out the scripts
from our workshop. Let’s do this.

295
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,080
Come.

296
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,840
Ready? Please sit down,
make yourselves comfortable.

297
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,120
Sit. Okay, and here is our official cast.

298
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay.

299
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,320
This is Ren and Sam.

300
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,120
As actors with the studio selected additional
to take part in this film acting alongside.

301
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,400
Alright, but first, let’s get to know each other.

302
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
Hello I’m Pharit.

303
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,640
Hello I'm Ren.

304
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,280
Hello I'm Sam.

305
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
What do you think, Sir?

306
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,960
The marketing plan needs to be
more internationally comprehensive.

307
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
Marketing needs to be more forward-thinking.

308
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,480
This plan doesn’t get my approval yet.

309
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,760
Mr. Armin has his first workshop today, Sir.

310
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,880
Will you go watch?

311
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,840
No, I better now.

312
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,160
Which room?

313
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,000
This way, Sir.

314
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,560
We're diving into some improv.

315
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,480
Everyone, please stay in character as briefed just now.

316
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,160
If everyone’s clear, get ready and begin.

317
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,480
What exactly do you want from me?

318
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,360
All I want is for you not to betray me.

319
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,920
Someone like you deserves to be betrayed.

320
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,560
Even your own friend betrayed you.

321
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
I didn’t mean it...

322
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,600
I didn’t mean it.

323
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,760
I was just jealous of you, that you have everything.

324
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,320
I didn’t mean it... I just...

325
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,880
Let Go!!!

326
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,480
I won’t ask what your reasons were.

327
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,520
And I’ll make you watch as I take my revenge.

328
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,600
You, the traitor, the one who stabbed me
in the back, the one who hurt me...

329
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,680
I will never let you find happiness.

330
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
I swear.

331
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
I’ll make all of you pay.

332
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
Uh, hold on a sec, Director. Wait a minute.

333
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,600
I’m really lost here...

334
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,760
What’s going on? Is this going overboard?

335
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,640
Are you planning to bully others?
Aren’t you worried your friends might get hurt?

336
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,080
Figures, you’re the one with connections.

337
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,800
So you're making the one
with connections look talented?

338
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,200
Ren.

339
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,520
So sorry.

340
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,480
How’s it going, Sam? You good?

341
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm good, Sir.

342
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,560
- You’re not hurt, are you?
- I’m not hurt.

343
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Armin?

344
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
You’re really feeling it, right?

345
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,400
But, but take it easy.
Overall, it’s really good hold onto that feeling.

346
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,120
Yeah... but just calm yourself down first.

347
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,760
Let your friend know it’s all good.

348
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,520
You can step out of character now. Okay?

349
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,960
Armin got this role just because of his connections?

350
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,560
Look at that. Out of nowhere,
a background character gets a lead role.

351
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,080
Even if no one says anything,
isn’t that something to talk about?

352
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,200
Uh….

353
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,480
Let’s get back to work.

354
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
Wenai.

355
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,160
Copy that.

356
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,800
Don't you think?

357
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Yeah.

358
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,520
You’ve both been placed on
indefinite leave from work.

359
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,240
Excuse me...

360
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,160
But may I ask what this is regarding?

361
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,520
From this point forward, you are not permitted to make
any negative comments about this company’s artists.

362
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Once everyone is ready, begin.

363
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,840
What are you doing sitting here?

364
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,480
Aren't you cold?

365
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,440
Don't be scared.

366
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,880
I won't hurt you.

367
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,840
Look.

368
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm safe.

369
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,560
Come and stay with me.

370
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,320
My home is warm and spacious.

371
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,720
What would I have to give in return?

372
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,480
A trade-off, huh?

373
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,680
Come and be by my side.

374
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Do whatever is needed.

375
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,600
Do anything and everything?

376
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,720
Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to do anything weird.

377
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,440
Just be with me to keep me company.

378
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,320
Come and live with me.

379
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,600
Cut! Good.

380
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,320
Awesome.

381
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,520
Everyone did really well today.

382
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,920
Now, go home and do your
character homework thoroughly.

383
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,320
We’ll see each other next time, okay?
Alright, thank you all.

384
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,240
Alright, see you!
See you, see you, see you!

385
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
Thanks a lot. Let’s go.

386
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,240
Ren, who always tries to hurt me.

387
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
I was super annoyed in the workshop earlier.

388
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,120
Armin was just terrible.

389
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
But he did pass the casting, Ren.

390
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,200
Come on, do you really think
I’d believe that? He totally has connections.

391
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,520
His acting sucked, and yet the director
didn’t even say a single thing.

392
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,520
He’s either a sponsor’s favorite
or backed by some rich guy.

393
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,120
He somehow lands a lead role
in a co-production film?

394
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,200
Jump that big?
He must’ve traded something for it.

395
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,920
If you’ve got something to say to me...

396
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,560
Go ahead.

397
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,920
Don't waste your time talking about me to others.

398
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,199
Just in case the info isn’t accurate.

399
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
I don’t want to get the wrong idea about you.

400
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,920
What’re you talking about?

401
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,880
Long day, huh, Armin?

402
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,000
Armin.

403
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,600
We haven’t had a proper conversation since that day.

404
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,320
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

405
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
I’m not really up for talking with you right now.

406
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,760
I simply want to live my life on my own terms
but differently this time.

407
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
What are you daydreaming about?

408
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,920
Is something bothering you?

409
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,080
Acting in this film is like hitting the reset button on my life.

410
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,920
But I’m not sure if I’m playing the game right,
or holding onto the right pieces.

411
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,520
I’m not sure I fully understand what you mean.

412
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,240
But I just want you to know that
you’re not playing this game alone.

413
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
Armin, you are one of mine.

414
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,640
What I mean is...

415
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,760
You’re an artist signed with my company.

416
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,360
Alright, and then what? I’m all ears.

417
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,240
Crown and I are in this game with you.

418
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,640
And we’re determined to make
this film and you a success.

419
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,280
Armin’s underdog status
is what easily earns people’s sympathy.

420
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,120
Therefore, to get him recognized,

421
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,840
we need to highlight this right from the start.

422
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,960
Let the media tell the story of
Armin’s struggles working side jobs

423
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,960
and pushing through hardships
before he got this acting role.

424
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,200
Basil pork stir-fry.

425
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,720
One, two, three.

426
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,760
There’s no need to come across so vulnerable.

427
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,280
Simply show the struggles endured,
along with unwavering determination.

428
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,360
This will help you tell your story,

429
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,640
highlight your heroism,
and inspire people to support you.

430
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,960
Will people really think the way we want them
to just from how we present it?

431
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Not everyone will go along with it.
There might be criticism or harmful news.

432
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,880
But if you stay quiet and let your work
and good news speak for you,

433
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,840
your fans will naturally want to defend you.

434
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,480
I truly feel bad about the news that has come out.

435
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,200
Ultimately, I hope people
will judge me by my work.

436
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,520
So, you're probably thinking about
your work that's been shown, right?

437
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,640
Yes.

438
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,800
Whenever I’m given the opportunity, I’ll give it my all.

439
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
- I’ll give it my all.
- Ahhhhh!!!!!…..

440
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,000
It's Armin….Armin!

441
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Please excuse me.

442
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,240
Hey Armin, is this place yours?

443
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
Yes it is.

444
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh! Wow…it’s true then!

445
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,520
We all really love you, Armin.

446
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,040
Yes, we’re really happy to see you.

447
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,080
Just wanted you to know don’t worry about the news.

448
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,680
We’ll still go watch your film no matter what.

449
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
Yes Yes.

450
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,320
Hold on, let me snap a quick picture.

451
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,480
By all means.

452
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,360
Yes.

453
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,560
If you don’t mind.

454
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880
- Auntie.
- What?

455
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
Where did all these people come from?

456
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,400
They followed him.

457
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,720
Here.

458
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,240
You're friend is famous now.

459
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,880
Thank you.

460
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Right now, Armin’s image has improved a lot.

461
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,560
Before, people used to gossip that
he was just a “kid with connections”

462
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,480
But now the reporters really like him
and feel a lot of sympathy for him

463
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,960
as someone who fights through life.

464
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,480
They also say he has
a lot of fans who love him.

465
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,920
In fact, the fans are currently organizing
a fan club group to support Armin.

466
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,440
So, it’s time for us...

467
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,400
to move on to the next marketing strategy
in support of Armin.

468
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,360
What is it?

469
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,840
What exactly is it, Janine?

470
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,320
Uh...is...!!!

471
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,320
I’ll go ask Mr. Tada myself.

472
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,080
I apologize.

473
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,160
Why can’t you cover my story?

474
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,120
I’ve already sent all the information.

475
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,520
The news you want to publish
was clearly meant to damage Armin,

476
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,760
which in turn makes me an enemy of Tada.

477
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,440
So, you know?

478
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,680
Everyone in the media world already knows that
you and your brother are at war with each other.

479
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Don’t drag me into it.

480
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,560
Is this enough to make you stand
and fight this war alongside me?

481
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,160
Tada isn’t just have Crown,
he’s got other businesses too.

482
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,320
I’m still recovering
from the Tom Yum Kung crisis.

483
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,080
I don’t want to make
an enemy out of Tada right now.

484
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,280
Mark my words, you’ll regret the day
you chose to become my enemy.

485
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,360
My boy looks so handsome today.

486
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,920
I’m really proud of you.

487
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,840
Wow!!

488
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,000
Whose boy is this? So handsome!

489
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,360
So handsome it’s practically
a headache and a heartbreaker too.

490
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,360
Lily’s into younger guys, huh?

491
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,000
Hello there, sir!

492
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,760
This is Achi. Please be kind to him, okay?

493
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,920
Take good care of him, dear. Let’s go!

494
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,880
Go ahead.

495
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,560
Thank you very much, sir!

496
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,720
Wow, thank you so much!

497
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,320
Lily will always take good care of you.

498
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,160
Wishing you lots of happiness.

499
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,000
Ah, that explains it.

500
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,160
No wonder you’re pushing this kid so hard.

501
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,440
The more you make the product hot.

502
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,120
The higher the value.

503
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,680
We warmly welcome all our honored guests.

504
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,040
To the 60th anniversary celebration
of Celeste Palace Bangkok.

505
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,840
This anniversary event
is bigger than any before.

506
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,200
I’m still curious who’s going to kick off the event.

507
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,080
Who do you think?

508
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Narin, the famous singer,

509
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,280
no one else at this event
stands out like him.

510
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,920
Rolls Royce Effect, will it really work?

511
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,640
Are you ready?

512
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,440
Oh it’s Mr.Tada.

513
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,440
With this camera as well, please.

514
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,720
This way please, Mr.Tada.

515
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,520
Ooooh…!

516
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,320
The human brain works by making comparisons.

517
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,600
You wouldn’t just park a Rolls Royce anywhere.

518
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,240
Because it would invite comparisons to the ordinary.

519
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,440
I will make sure you stand out beyond ordinary.

520
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,840
With this camera as well, please.

521
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,680
With this camera as well, please.

522
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,800
Hey…

523
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,520
That’s Mr.Tada, the president
of Crown Enterprises, right?

524
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
He normally doesn’t attend events like this, right?

525
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,800
A truly rare photo.

526
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,920
By the way... who’s he with?

527
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,840
Yeah, who?

528
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
Hello Mr. Chairman.

529
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,200
You need to attend a grand event.

530
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,840
The human brain will associate you with that greatness.

531
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,040
A grand event makes you special.

532
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,680
And you become as valuable as a Rolls Royce.

533
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,960
You give me your body, I give you fame.

534
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
Those are the rules.

535
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,520
Please don’t make me feel
awkward like everyone else.

536
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,240
Can’t we just forget those rules?

537
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,280
My new life gained recognition faster.

538
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,560
And became more valuable because of you, Tada.

539
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,040
Do I have something on my face?

540
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,440
No, I just feel grateful.

541
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,000
But no words seem enough
to truly capture what I feel for you.

542
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,400
Then just be thankful and accept it.

543
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,760
Nice to see you here, Mr.Tada.

544
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,320
You didn’t mention you were coming.

545
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,320
I’m sorry for interrupting.

546
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,000
I didn’t realize you were
in the middle of a conversation.

547
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,000
May I ask who you are?

548
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,280
Hello, Sir. I’m Armin.

549
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,000
Ahh… Hello.

550
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,640
I’ve heard a reputation about you.

551
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,480
Thank you so much.

552
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
If you’ll excuse me,
I’m going the restroom.

553
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,480
Please do continue your conversation.

554
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,400
You don’t usually show up at events like this.

555
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,240
You’ve always watched me from a distance.

556
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,080
Every time I invited you, you turned me down.

557
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,040
So it’s a bit strange, seeing you here today.

558
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,680
He must be someone truly special to you.

559
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,920
Come talk to me immediately.

560
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,960
Mr.Tada.

561
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,080
You do realize you're crossing the line, don’t you?

562
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,720
Yes.

563
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,960
I’m always aware but I just couldn’t control myself.

564
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,080
I’m sorry for what I said.

565
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,280
- I truly hope you’ll give me another chance.
- No.

566
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,360
The agreement between you and me ends here.

567
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,360
But I already apologized.

568
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,720
I crossed the line.

569
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,440
I broke the rules you set but beyond all of that...

570
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,200
Have you ever felt the same way about me

571
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,920
as I feel about you?

572
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,000
Poor Narin, huh?

573
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,800
Tada brought in a new guy for the debut.

574
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,480
And now from being number one,
he’s dropped to number two.

575
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,320
Oh!!!

576
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,360
Armin!!!

577
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,200
I’m asking for one more chance, Mr.Tada.

578
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,360
To let me love you.

579
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,440
I’ll stay within my own confines,
and that’s all I need.

580
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,640
Narin, let go.

581
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,120
I apologize for interrupting.

582
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,440
I truly didn’t mean to.

583
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,920
Narin!!!

584
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,680
Please give me one more chance.

585
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,840
That's enough, Narin.

586
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,080
Mr.Tada.

587
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:25,920
Armin.

588
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,840
Wait, Armin!!!

589
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,080
Armin.

590
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,720
Armin, give me a moment to explain?

591
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,880
Armin, please.

592
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,120
Narin is just an artist in the company.

593
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,120
We were just discussing
about our agreement earlier.

594
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,240
What happens between him and you.

595
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,080
Whatever you two talk about.

596
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,240
It’s none of my business.

597
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,680
But I’m honestly asking you...

598
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,200
Why have you been trying
so hard to help me all this time?

599
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,880
So, what is it that you really want from me?

600
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,600
You want me to be like Narin? Is that it?

601
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,480
What I hate the most is being the third wheel.

602
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,320
But right now.

603
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,240
I really hate that I’ve become the third wheel
in someone else’s relationship.

604
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,280
Since I was born.

605
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,080
I’ve never been in a relationship with anyone.

606
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,320
Narin approached me with a deal.

607
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,240
Everything between him and me was business.

608
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,960
But with you, it’s different.

609
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,080
Enough. You don’t have to do this.

610
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,000
Whatever you choose to do is your own right.

611
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,720
No need to explain anything.

612
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,280
I never knew you before.

613
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,720
And I think, It should go back to being that way.

614
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,480
I'm sorry.

615
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,360
Thank you for everything you've done.

616
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,720
But there are some things I just can’t accept.

617
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,040
I don’t want to be the cause of hurting anyone’s relationship.

618
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,240
And I don’t want to be just a business transaction for you.

619
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,200
Alright then, please get some rest.

620
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,120
I won’t disturb you anymore.

621
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,960
You’ve misunderstood me.

622
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,600
Let’s just say I apologize for everything.

623
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,240
Can we start over?

624
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,360
If there’s anything you want me to change.

625
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,400
I’ll do it.

626
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,480
Just tell me.

627
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,120
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

628
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,120
♫ Like a book already written ♫

629
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,880
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

630
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,600
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

631
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,360
♫ The day I found you ♫

632
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,200
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

633
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,040
♫ It was fate that drew the line,
making me love you ♫

634
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,520
♫ I believe that ♫

635
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,880
♫ If that day we hadn’t met ♫

636
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
♫ If I had simply overlooked you ♫

637
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,560
♫ Would things have changed? ♫

638
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,720
♫ Even if the story were different ♫

639
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,520
♫ I think we'd still be the same ♫

640
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,440
♫ Nothing would change ♫

641
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
If I could change what’s happening at this moment.

642
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,960
My future could change as well.

643
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,200
Could this be the reason why
I was able to go back in time?

644
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,880
“Deep Depths.”

645
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,680
You can spare some time for me now, right?

646
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,280
Meet me tomorrow at the perfume photoshoot.

647
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,360
Bring your lucky charm necklace too.

648
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,200
I owe my happiness in this new life
becuase of you, Tada.
