1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,400
Past life, 1999.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm so sorry , I'm sorry.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,200
Hey! You can’t even deliver this simple line!

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,600
The whole crew’s been waiting on you alone.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,520
But, Sir…

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,840
I want to be the lead role.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,840
If you wanna be a lead, damn it,
you gotta have everything it takes!

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,320
Don’t dream so high kid, you’ll just fall hard.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,840
That’s why they’re holding you back
with long contract delays because you suck!

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,720
Your acting is crap,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
your speech is unclear,
and you can’t even do action scenes.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
Go and get out of my sight already!

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Get lost and go die somewhere! Go!

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,240
Hello.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,960
You’re not seriously thinking of jumping, are you?

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,960
Who is this?

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,360
How’d you get my number?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,520
I’m just...

19
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,320
a fan of yours.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,600
My fan?

21
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,120
Yeah.

22
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,039
Since the first time you walked past the scene,

23
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,520
barely showing your face.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,640
Then the next project,
where you were actually in front of the camera.

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,520
And now, you finally have lines to say.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
Hey!

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
You scare me.

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Are you crazy or what.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,039
Just want to say, don’t give up yet.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,840
There are still fans who always follow your success.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,400
Even though there’s nothing to believe in,

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,120
I still want to believe you.

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
Because it gives me a little more hope…

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
Thank you.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Time will make you believe me.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,920
Hey, wait… don’t hang up just yet.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,480
So...

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
As my very first fan.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,360
May I ask you what’s your name?

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,320
TD.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,280
Your fan name is TD.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,400
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,960

Why do these two keep circling around my life endlessly?

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Hello Charlie.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
I’d like to arrange a meeting.

89
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Mr. Tada!

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
What are you doing?

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I really should just watch you quietly from afar.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,320
You are T D.

93
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,080
My very first fan.

94
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,360
In every moment of life.

95
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,480
Whether my past life or this new one…

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
You’ve always been there.

97
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Whatever it is you need?

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,040
I will be the one to care for and support you myself.

99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,080
#Armin’slover

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,680
I am yours Tada.

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,280
You’re staring at me like you’re afraid I might disappear.

102
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,680
I’m just afraid this is only a dream...

103
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,400
and that I’ll wake up soon.

104
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,640
But at least it’s a sweet dream.

105
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
You really have nothing to be afraid of.

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
So lucky…

107
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,760
that it’s real.

108
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,240
Come on, get up now.

109
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Today, I’m taking you shopping.

110
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
But it’s a public place.

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,360
Let everyone know one more thing…

112
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
that you’re my special person.

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,440
You said this was a business trip,

114
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
but I don’t see you working at all.

115
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,159
Hey!

116
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,760
Today’s our first day as a couple.

117
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,440
I want to spend time with you.

118
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,360
Is it Lover's Day?

119
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,560
No.

120
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,880
It’s not just about today.

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,680
We can’t have only one Lover's Day you know.

122
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,040
I want every day with you to feel just like this.

123
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
You get that privilege, right now.

124
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,200
How are you?

125
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,640
Money is running out.

126
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,960
What have you been doing?

127
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,200
There is money, but not enough for you to embezzle.

128
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
Thiwthit!

129
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,160
Mom, can you stop interfering with me right now?

130
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,120
I’m already having a terrible headache.

131
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,320
I’m just an MD. It’s not like I can handle everything easily, ok?

132
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Besides, everything is like this because of you.

133
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,840
You’re the one who let Crown slip away.

134
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,880
That’s exactly why I need you
to take Crown back for me.

135
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
I’ve heard from insiders...

136
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,800
that Stardaily is about to run a story
on the new kid Crown is grooming.

137
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,240
Is it an Insider or a Poker Club?

138
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,760
Whichever it is, they’re working harder than you are.

139
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,200
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

140
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,560
So if what you said is true.

141
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,040
Who would dare to spread rumors
about Crown’s new talent?

142
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Ren the son of the owner
of the newspaper, Star Daily Report.

143
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,640
Time changes, everything changes.

144
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,680
But I love moments like this the most.

145
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,320
When the stars are just within arm’s reach.

146
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
Just say the word.

147
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
No matter how many stars or moons,

148
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
I’ll find them all for you.

149
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,480
Did you know that in the future,
people can actually buy stars for someone?

150
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,120
I heard that some fans have even bought stars
for their favorite artists and named them after them too.

151
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,920
Really?

152
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,560
That’s nice.

153
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,720
When someone looks up at the sky.

154
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,520
I can tell them.

155
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,080
This is Armin’s Universe.

156
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,240
Actually… I think it’s kinda...

157
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Hey, stop that thought right there.

158
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
Why not?

159
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
I just want everyone to know...

160
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,760
how much you mean to me.

161
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,960
I’ve got a way for you to say you love me
without spending a single cent.

162
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Just follow my lead, okay?

163
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,160
All those stars up there.

164
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I'm...

165
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,839
giving them all to you along with my whole heart.

166
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,359
What is that?

167
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,400
“Mini heart” back in my day, that’s what we used to call it.

168
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,680
Mini heart.

169
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,680
Then...

170
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,600
I’m giving you all my mini hearts
with all of my heart.

171
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,000
Don’t you want them?

172
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,040
In our past life…

173
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Did you reject me?

174
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,560
Why couldn’t I reveal myself to you?

175
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,040
In my past life...

176
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,160
I went through so much
just to become a well-known actor.

177
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,240
It actually took me years after this…

178
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,080
But I was lucky to have TD.
always cheering me on,

179
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,640
always by my side...

180
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Even though I never got to meet him,

181
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,120
not even on the day I died.

182
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,200
Please…

183
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
Don’t talk about dying anymore, okay?

184
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
Do you believe what I just told you?

185
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,720
I don’t know.

186
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,000
I just feel pain and can’t breathe.

187
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,480
Like when I saw you die in that scene.

188
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,080
I just can’t bear it anymore.

189
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,640
Tada.

190
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,920
Are you really just my fan?

191
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,560
I might be different from other fans.

192
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
I love you more than just your acting.

193
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,240
I love all of you.

194
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,480
Everything that makes you who you are.

195
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,760
There’s something I want to tell you.

196
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,880
Nine years ago, a young man lost his father,

197
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,000
and was forced by his stepmother to return abroad.

198
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,040
He was then excluded from the company
and disinherited from everything his father had built.

199
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,960
One day, he wandered aimlessly on a bridge,

200
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,400
feeling unloved by his father,

201
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,480
allowing his stepmother to destroy his life.

202
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Just before he decided to end it all.

203
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,240
Hey… hey! Over here!

204
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,360
What are you doing?

205
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,880
- Calm down.
- He met a young guy.

206
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,880
I’ll come up to you, don’t do anything yet.

207
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I’ll come up to you.

208
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,240
Are you okay?

209
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,960
It’s about to rain…

210
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,520
How about we get something warm to eat first.

211
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,440
Here. For you.

212
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,720
That kid gave him a cup of instant noodles.

213
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,880
Take it.

214
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,840
And then they shared it until it was all gone.

215
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,120
He only realized then
just how hungry he was that day.

216
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,040
And that feeling of fullness that day
gave him the strength to fight on.

217
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,640
He spoke with his father’s personal lawyer.

218
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,160
And learned that his father
had left most of the inheritance to him.

219
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,760
All he had to do was graduate and prove himself
worthy of becoming an executive.

220
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,120
He went back abroad not to run away, but to prepare.

221
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,320
He did everything to reclaim what was rightfully his.

222
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
That boy…

223
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,280
It was like he died and was born again.

224
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,880
He was determined to reset
his life from the ground up.

225
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,560
The only thing that remains the same.

226
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,280
Is probably the memory…

227
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,240
and the feelings he still has
for the boy who saved his life.

228
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,360
Are you that young boy?

229
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,480
I guess it’s just like the feeling you once told me…

230
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,400
the way you felt about me, about TD.

231
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,960
And how those feelings became one.

232
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,800
Mine are the same.

233
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,160
At first, I only meant to
support you quietly from afar.

234
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,560
Following your work,
cheering you on as just another fan.

235
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,760
But day by day,
my heart sank deeper and deeper.

236
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,400
Until I could no longer hide
in the shadows anymore.

237
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,680
I don’t know how I could ever repay you.

238
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
You’ve already repaid me…

239
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,120
with that cup of noodles.

240
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,560
If that cup of noodles
made you give your heart to me.

241
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
Then I want something more from you.

242
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,880
Something that will bind us closer.

243
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,280
I have three wishes to grant you.

244
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,920
You can ask me for anything you want.

245
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,320
Armin.

246
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,680
You already know what I want.

247
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,720
No.

248
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,760
You don’t know what will happen in the future.

249
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,080
I want to kiss you.

250
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,440
That’s your first wish?

251
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,400
And what if I told you that’s not a wish.

252
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
What would you say?

253
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,280
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

254
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,880
♫ Like a book already written ♫

255
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,720
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

256
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,960
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

257
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,240
♫ The day I found you ♫

258
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,680
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

259
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,960
♫ It was fate that drew the line, making me love you ♫

260
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,200
♫ I believe that ♫

261
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
You are my greatest gift.

262
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,640
♫ if I had simply overlooked you ♫

263
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,240
♫ Would things have changed? ♫

264
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,480
♫ Even if the story were different ♫

265
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
♫ I think we'd still be the same ♫

266
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,080
♫ Nothing would change ♫

267
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,160
♫ Even if I turned back time and start over countless times ♫

268
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,040
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

269
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,240
Are you sure that person is here?

270
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,640
The owner is the boss lady herself.

271
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,200
As for her son, who’s behind this.

272
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,000
He likes to hang out at the bar there.

273
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,880
Ren is the hottest rising star in the industry.

274
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,400
Until Armin swooped in and stole
the co-production role right from under him.

275
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,400
As for Ren’s mother, she’s a queen of entertainment news.

276
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,240
I’ve already arranged for someone to
introduce you to the right people.

277
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,400
Right this way, sir.

278
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,000
Hello Mr. Ren.

279
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
I have something to discuss with you.

280
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
Do you have a moment?

281
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,840
Wait a moment.

282
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,280
I think you should step outside first.

283
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,680
Mr. Thiwthit wants to speak with me in private.

284
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,600
Go on.

285
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,680
Let’s be straightforward.

286
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,520
What is it that you want?

287
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,200
Cooperation.

288
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,600
Because we both want the same thing.

289
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Do you really know...

290
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,520
What I want?

291
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,120
Star Daily is going to have a big scoop soon, right.

292
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
If you know that much.

293
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,640
Then you should also know that
I want to destroy that damn supporting actor.

294
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,000
But I have no intention of becoming Crown’s enemy.

295
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,160
Which is why I’m working with you.

296
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,200
You still don’t know Crown well enough.

297
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,640
Tada won’t let you get away with this.

298
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,800
Honestly, if he really wanted to do it.

299
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
He would’ve done it a long time ago right.

300
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,000
When I made that offer.

301
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,320
You should see it!

302
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,360
And I also know that...

303
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,120
Tada sees Armin as just a toy.

304
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,440
That Crown will eventually throw away.

305
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,080
If it’s flawed.

306
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,200
Besides, they should thank me.

307
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,680
For dealing with that useless kid.

308
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, come on.

309
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
I already told you.

310
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,360
I’m his younger brother.

311
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,360
I know him better than you do.

312
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,080
But if you don’t believe me.

313
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,920
That’s your problem.

314
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,920
Huh…

315
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,280
I think those words should’ve come from me instead.

316
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,200
Sorry to say.

317
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,000
But I probably can’t help you anyway.

318
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,520
Sorry I don’t need your help.

319
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,520
Let’s just say today is the day.

320
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,240
We got to meet each other as comrades.

321
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,720
Maybe one day.

322
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,440
The two of us will work together.

323
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,040
Oh, I’ve already seen it.

324
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,720
I can guarantee it.

325
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,560
Crown would never trade that nobody kid for our Newspaper.

326
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,000
OK!!! Hurry up just release it.

327
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,760
Hey… are you sure about doing this?

328
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,920
That news will affect the movie
‘Deep Depths’, you’re starring in.

329
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,440
Can’t you see this is a family war?

330
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,680
And you still want to get involved.

331
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,600
So annoying.

332
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,240
Just kill them if you can.

333
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,880
Whoever dies, I don’t give a damn.

334
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
So what’s wrong now?

335
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Suddenly you want to know everything,
act like you know it all.

336
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,760
Why now? Where were you before?

337
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,560
when the news broke you didn’t help at all.

338
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,040
And now you show up acting all concerned this and that.

339
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Ugh… coward!!!

340
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,960
What’s your deal now?
You want money or something?

341
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,920
Tch… useless

342
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,320
I’ve done everything you asked for,
and now you call me useless

343
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,800
I leaked fake news about every actor.

344
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,680
I set up that ‘accident’ during Armin’s perfume shoot.

345
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,360
And you still dare to call me useless.

346
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,240
Oh my god, what the hell is all this?

347
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,920
You’re so damn annoying!

348
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,920
Talking like you know everything.

349
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,840
ugh, enough already.

350
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,520
Hmph! Get out. The door’s right there. Bye.

351
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,680
You’re dismissed. Shoo.

352
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,800
Get lost, you dumb bitch!

353
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,800
And don’t you dare come back. I’m so done with you.

354
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,360
God…

355
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,200
You dumb bitch!

356
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,600
What the hell was that nonsense she just spewed.

357
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,080
This camera please.

358
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,440
This way too.

359
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,080
Everyone, Armin.

360
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,880
Armin, This camera please.

361
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,040
This camera please. Armin.

362
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,520
This way too.

363
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,800
This camera please.

364
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,639
This camera please.

365
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,199
This camera please.

366
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,400
You know, in the future.

367
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,960
This kind of movie will be very popular.

368
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,080
Just in case you’re interested.

369
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,800
A Boy Love movie like this.

370
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,400
Which company do you think I should invest in?

371
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,400
You trust me that much.

372
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,120
My money is your money.

373
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,040
If there’s a Nasdaq stock called iQ, invest in it.

374
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,680
It’s a streaming platform set to generate huge profits
and grow the fastest in the Asian market.

375
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,640
You really know that much.

376
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,440
I told you… I’m from the future.

377
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,800
Or maybe just try talking to that director.

378
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,640
He might have some good ideas.

379
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,840
Pedro, the director of "Psychosis".

380
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,920
The film that won me an award before I time travelled back.

381
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
May I take over your bar a moment.

382
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,240
Yes sir.

383
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,040
take it.

384
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,160
Are you jealous?

385
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,240
Nope.

386
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
Who’s jealous?

387
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,880
Nope.

388
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,520
For someone as talented as you...

389
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,760
Is there anything you haven’t told me yet?

390
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,080
Or is there something else you’d like to tell me?

391
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,640
Hmm… In just over 20 years.

392
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,600
The entertainment industry will shift completely
constantly evolving and transforming.

393
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,520
And… will Crown still be mine by then.

394
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
That’s the one thing I regret not knowing.

395
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,560
All I know is Crown still exists.

396
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,760
and you’re still my TD.

397
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,600
Maybe that’s more than enough.

398
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,400
What about you? Anything you want to tell me?

399
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,120
Never thought a billionaire like.

400
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,480
You could mix such a good cocktail.

401
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,800
Each person’s favorite cocktail...

402
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,520
Says a lot about their lifestyle.

403
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,360
Their taste.

404
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,880
And even the direction of their work.

405
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,560
I learned all of that when I had to start a new life abroad.

406
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,120
In that case.

407
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,240
I guess my versatility comes from
having lived a life once already.

408
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,880
Good experience is for old people.

409
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,240
Who live life with quality.

410
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,560
Old people!

411
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
Even if you get older.

412
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,000
I’ll always be ready to make delicious cocktails for you.

413
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,280
Anything.

414
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,760
As long as it means I get to be with you forever.

415
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,720
Someone like you.

416
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,400
In 20 years, they’d call that Love-struck.

417
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,200
But...

418
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
It’s loving you that’s...

419
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,600
got me truly stuck.

420
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,600
For you.

421
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,680
You can eat this, right? This spaghetti.

422
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,840
It might not be like instant noodles.

423
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,280
It’s pretty tasty.

424
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,400
You said you’ve learned a lot because
you reset your life and started over.

425
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,600
You know, I reset my life too.

426
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,440
You mean the time I helped you from ending your own life?

427
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,840
That too...

428
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,240
For me, you are my lifesaver.

429
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,600
Back then, my life...

430
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,960
Didn’t have a clear purpose.

431
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,320
Until I saw you die in that drama scene.

432
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Since that day, my life has changed.

433
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,680
It’s no longer just about Crown.

434
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,120
With you, it feels like

435
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,320
I’ve finally reached for the stars I’ve always dreamed of...

436
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,880
like my life has been reset once again.

437
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,800
For you.

438
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,720
That’s true.

439
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,920
When I realized I had reset my life again.

440
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,080
All I thought about was living better.

441
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Working harder.

442
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,480
Trying more.

443
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,920
I just wanted this new life to bring me fame.

444
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,600
And success.

445
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,320
But now, I think I’ve reset my life.

446
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,640
To love you.

447
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,320
So this chance I got, one more time is to...

448
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,000
Surprise you for the very first time.

449
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,440
What kind of surprise?

450
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,240
There’s nothing that can stop
someone lovestruck like me.

451
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,320
Happy birthday Mr. Armin.

452
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,280
Well, the cake might not be as good-looking as me.

453
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,400
since I didn’t have much time.

454
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,600
But...

455
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,920
I made it with all my heart.

456
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,520
Did you secretly make this somewhere?

457
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,720
May you be so happy that others
get jealous every single day.

458
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,360
This is the first wish I want to ask from you.

459
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,600
No matter what I give you, must accept it.

460
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,520
This is too much.

461
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,360
Nothing is too much for my Armin.

462
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,240
Be very happy.

463
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,720
Make a wish first.

464
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,640
Thank you.

465
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,800
What are you wishing for?

466
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
If I tell you, it won’t come true.

467
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,120
I pray that this life will be our final reset.

468
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,640
Now, everything will happen at a faster pace.

469
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:09,160
But I wish the time I spend with you
will always slow down like this forever.

470
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,440
My 2nd wish is to be inside of you.

471
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,680
Mr. Tada, Janine just sent a fax.

472
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Is there something wrong?

473
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,200
He’s definitely coming back today.

474
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
Just don’t take your eyes off him.

475
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,480
Mr. Thiwtit, have you seen this news?

476
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,080
Rising Star Takes Shortcut, Trails Personal Photographer.

477
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,160
Who would do something like this?

478
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,200
I know...

479
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,400
There’s someone who knows
you were going to see Charlie that day.

480
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,120
I need to hold a press conference.

481
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,360
I don’t want yours and Director Liu”s film,
Deep Depths.

482
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,040
Or the other actors to be affected.

483
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,400
Could you ask Janine to book
a plane ticket for me right away.

484
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,800
Do you trust me?

485
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,040
What will you do?

486
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,960
It’s time...

487
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,280
For us to uproot these people completely.

488
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,800
So they can’t mess with you like this again.

489
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,360
But…

490
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,600
You might have to take a bit of a risk.

491
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,360
I trust you.

492
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,360
Are you sure Armin is here?

493
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,280
My boss said this source is legit.

494
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,480
It probably has to be, right?

495
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,440
Otherwise, they wouldn't have spread the news
to every single agency all at once.

496
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,520
Yeah, at this point, anyone who misses out will be left behind.

497
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,920
Yes.

498
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,320
Oh, isn't that Armin's manager?

499
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,240
Janine, can we get an interview?

500
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,400
Where's Armin?

501
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,320
Oh! There’s Armin.

502
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,440
Where's Armin?

503
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,280
Where is he?

504
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,600
Wait, Janine.

505
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,360
Wait!!!

506
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,280
He's not here! Armin's not here at all!

507
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,840
What's going on?

508
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,280
Please calm down, everyone.

509
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,040
Armin will be here soon.

510
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,960
- When will he be here?
- What day exactly?

511
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,280
So, he's definitely coming today, right?

512
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,640
Take it easy. Calm down.

513
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,040
Oh, is that Armin?

514
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,520
Yes, that's Armin!

515
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,800
Mr. Armin, can we get an interview?

516
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,200
- Stop, stop, stop! Everyone.
- Mr. Armin, can we get an interview?

517
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,840
Everyone, please calm down first.

518
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,400
He'll answer all your questions.

519
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,880
But please, calm down first. Excuse me.

520
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,880
It's okay.

521
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,240
I'll answer every question directly.

522
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,640
You know, there’s only one thing that can really stress me out.

523
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,320
That is seeing you unhappy.

524
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,640
Right now, we might not be able to go public yet.

525
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
But with TD, you can always be yourself.

526
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,720
TD loves you, Tada loves you too

527
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,120
I want to see you shine as the brightest star.
