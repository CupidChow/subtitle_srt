Armin Tiwanon.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Began his entertainment career in 1997,

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,000
starting as a guest actor and later transitioning into supporting roles.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,400
He proved himself through his talent and dedication,

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,240
becoming one of the most successful actors of his era.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,520
He is also the only one selected to star
in the internationally acclaimed film Psychosis,

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,400
which achieved global success.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,720
Thank you, TD.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
I was once a supporting actor with small roles...

49
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,200
I couldn't act well, I didn't perform well.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,120
I had no work...

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,280
and I considered giving up on acting many times.

52
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,080
But there was one person... who never gave up on me.

53
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,520
They were my first fan, always encouraging me,

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,760
like a guiding star,

55
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,880
leading me to meet many other guiding stars.

56
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,240
And that person is all of you.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
And most importantly,

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:40,520
I have to thank... the person who has been by my side
from the day I had nothing to the day I achieved success.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Thank you so much…

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Charlie.

61
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you.

62
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,800
Congratulations on your success. I'll always support you, TD.

63
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,520
Congratulations on your success. I'll always support you, TD.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,760
If I wanted to ask him to meet me just once,

65
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,280
so I could thank him... would that be possible?

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
Congratulations.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Thank you.

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
Hello, Charlie.

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
Did you hear what I said on stage?

70
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,680
I already know what you said on stage.

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,640
Uh, when are you coming to the after party?

72
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,520
I just have a quick interview, but I’ll hurry.

73
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
I want to hug you.

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,159
You should hurry back, Guests are all waiting for you at the party.

75
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,040
Talk to me first. I want to clear things up.

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
What was that sound?

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,720
It’s nothing… just a guest… someone at the party…

78
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,600
I’ll talk to you later. See you soon.

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Hey... so where exactly are you giving that interview, huh?

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,640
I’ll just do the interview at the after party. Let’s go!

81
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,920
Huh... M-Mean the party? Armin...

82
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,520
Are you sure about this, Armin?

83
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Oh man...

84
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,280
After Party at Armin’s House.

85
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,120

86
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,600

89
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,920
Mr. Armin, may I interview you for a moment?

90
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,040
Congratulations! But right now,
I’d like to know more about your announcement.

91
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,159
- How is it?
- Have you been together for long?

92

How did you meet and where?
There’s never been any news about it before.

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,960
Uh... Everyone, all the journalists,

94
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,840
we’re going to have an interview over there.

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Armin is heading into the event now. Let’s go, quickly!

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,920
Thank you…. Thank you…Everyone, Thank you.

97
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,480
Hey...

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
What do you think you're doing?

99
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,320
Why did you invite so many reporters here? Huh?

100
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,160
Today is my special day.

101
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,960
I just want everyone to know the real me

102
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
before I retire.

103
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
Have you really thought this through?

104
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
I want everyone to know the person I love.

105
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,559
Phat.

106
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,320
Sorry, I need to hurry and go set up the food.

107
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,200
You're still mad at me?

108
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,680
Were we ever friends before?

109
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,520
I didn’t think I had the right to get come near you.

110
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
I apologize.

111
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,760
Congratulations, Armin.

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,000
You beat me twice, both at the audition and now with this award.

113
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Thank you.

114
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,720
Congratulations.

115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,080
Excuse me, there's something someone asked me to give you.

116
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,640
For Armin.

117
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,040
From who?

119
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
Well, now that we're all here…

120
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,200
Shall we have a drink?

121
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,720
Uh...excuse me, waiter.

122
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
Can I get a glass?

123
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,240
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,640
Whoo…

For Armin.

128
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,080
Mr. Ren, Mr. Pharit.

129
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Could I take a photo here?

130
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes, of course.

131
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Excuse me, I'll take my leave now.

132
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
Armin

133
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
Are you okay?

134
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
Um, I'm okay.

135
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
Sam, you have to leave. Armin will see if you stay.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,880
Talk to me first. I want to clear things up.

137
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,640
No, it’s just... people can’t know about us.

138
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
That’s enough.

139
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Answer me first.

140
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,640
What will happen to us from now on?

141
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,600
Am I just going to be your secret lover like this?

142
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
We’ve talked and cleared things up, haven’t we?

143
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,360
What else do you want now?

144
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,840
We need to go down to the event.

145
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,960
Kiss me.

146
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Just tell me you love me, and I’ll do anything for you.

147
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,960
Sam.

148
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Sam.

149
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
Sam.

150
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
Sam, I love you.

151
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,120
Is that enough for you?

152
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,280
No matter how much Armin claims me as his,

153
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
it doesn’t change anything between the two of us.

154
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,680
Trust me.

155
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
I love you too.

156
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,640
Armin.

157
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Armin.

158
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,960
With Sam, huh?

159
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Armin.

160
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,920
Armin, listen to me first.

161
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,880
Armin, listen to me first.

162
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,160
How could you do this to me?

163
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
Armin, listen to me first.

164
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,120
Let go !!!

165
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,720
Damn it!!

166
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,200
Because of you!

167
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Armin.

168
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,000
Armin.

169
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,600
Calm down.

170
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,280
Calm down.

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,800
Let go.

172
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Let go of me!

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,760
Your nose is bleeding.

174
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,560
Leave me alone!!!

175
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
I’m going to tell everyone.

176
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,760
How terrible the two of you are.

177
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Armin, please don't do that.

178
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,080
Do you think you’re the only one who can treat me this badly?

179
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
It didn’t mean anything. It was just sex.

180
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
Charlie.

181
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,560
You just told me you loved me!

182
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,680
Shut up, Sam!

183
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,560
But you just said…

184
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,680
What did I say?!

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,040
The person I trust as my lover,

186
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,080
and my best friend who I think of as a brother.

187
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,680
Just a few hours ago, you pretended to be so innocent in front of me.

188
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,600
The reason to pretend is because you’re more famous than me,

189
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
so I have to stay quiet.

190
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Armin.

191
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,560
I’ll do anything for you. I’ll do whatever it takes.

192
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,240
I’ll even be your mistress if that’s what you want.

193
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,480
Don’t make a big deal out of something so stupid, alright?

194
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,120
Please. Armin.

195
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,000
You’re really disgusting.

196
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Get out of my house!

197
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,680
Get out of my house!

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Get out of my house!  G-E-T   O-U-T !!!

199
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
Get out of my house!

200
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,960
- Armin.
- Get out!

201
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,360
Stop Armin.

202
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:29,960
Let go of me.

203
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
- I told you to stop.
- Let go of me.

204
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,800
Let go.

205
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,440
How could you do this?

206
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
How could you do this?!

207
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,280
I didn’t mean to.

208
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,080
How long has it been?

209
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,240
I love you.

210
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
Listen to me first.

211
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,240
I love you.

212
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,520
Why did you do this?

213
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
What did you so, Sam?

214
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
All because of you.

215
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,440
Armin.

216
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,760
You…

217
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,640
Because of you!

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,440
I told you to stop!

219
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,040
I’ve always helped you.

220
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,600
How could you do this?

221
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
Get a hold of yourself.

222
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,040
Ahhh!!!

223
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,920
Armin.

224
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,680
Armin, Armin.

225
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,760
Everything I've fought for my whole life.

226
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,960
Is this it...? The prize of  success.

227
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
So this is how painful it is?

228
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm going to die.

229
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,280
Dying in the most pathetic way.

230
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,680
- Armin.
- On set of "The Throne Series" (1999)

231
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,280
- Armin, are you okay?
- On set of "The Throne Series" (1999)

232
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
- Armin.
- On set of "The Throne Series" (1999)

233
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,480
- Armin how are you?
- Armin.

234
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Armin, Armin.

235
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,840
Armin.

236
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,120
Armin.

237
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,400
Oh...!!! Ugh!!!

238
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,920
What the hell is wrong with you? Hey!

239
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Hey!

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,960
Congratulations.

241
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
What the hell is wrong with you?

242
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,120
Huh? What is it?

243
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you? Hey!

244
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Hey, what the hell is wrong with him?

245
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,680
What the hell...what's going on?

246
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,119
If this is the afterlife.

247
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
Then what's happening to me now?

248
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
What's it?

249
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
Join us for the 1999 Loy Krathong Festival at Amornkiri temple.

250
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,920
Or is this not death?

251
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
But it is….

252
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,920
Reset.

253
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,440
Hey…You

254
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,080
Hey…You

255
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
Hmm... Finally woke up, huh?

256
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,920
I thought you were gonna die on me.

257
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,720
Phat.

258
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,600
Yeah,

259
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,960
it’s me.

260
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,800
Were we ever friends before?

261
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Why aren’t you old?

262
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,560
What the hell? I’m only in my twenties!

263
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,400
What’s the matter with you?

264
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
Running away from the mess you
left behind on set and now pretending to be crazy?

265
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,920
What the hell just happened?

266
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,480
I just died.

267
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,040
I just died.

268
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa Armin. Calm down.

269
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,920
Armin, calm down.

270
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
- Let go.
- Armin.

271
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,560
Armin.

272
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,680
- Armin, calm down.
- Sir, please!

273
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,720
Nurse, please help me stop him.

274
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,520
Armin!

275
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
Catch my friend please!

276
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,960
Let go!

277
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,560
Armin!

278
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,160
Phat tell me what year this is?

279
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
It’s 1999, okay?

280
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,680
1999

281
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,080
Here.

282
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,200
All cleared.

283
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
How did I end up here?

284
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,360
Huh…

285
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,960
I should be the one asking you.

286
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,280
The hospital contacted me and said a good Samaritan brought you in.

287
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,440
Who brought me here?

288
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,840
They left, but paid for your medicine and everything.

289
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,520
Seems like they were not just a good Samaritan, but a rich one too.

290
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,600
Why?

291
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,400
Do you know them?

292
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,360
Hmm..I don’t.

293
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Oh come on, stop wondering!

294
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,960
Let’s go, time to head back.

295
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,960
I gotta help Aunt Jeed open the shop.

296
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,720
Hey, why are you just standing there Mister Supermodel?

297
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,600
Hurry up.

298
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,000
Wait a minute. Can you take me to a place first?

299
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,000
Let’s go.

300
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,880
Armin.

301
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,360
Where the hell did you have me bring you?

302
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,040
Are we meeting to pick up some drugs?

303
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,520
My life, it really reset.

304
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,560
Here. Your meds!

305
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Now go back to your room and don’t cause any more trouble.

306
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,720
I’m already losing enough income as it is.

307
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,800
You’re lucky I don’t have to pay for your drugs.

308
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
I just wanted to be sure about something.

309
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,680
I...

310
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,600
Armin, I’m begging you, can you stop being so polite with me?

311
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,880
Huh, buddy?

312
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,360
Just a little bump on your head and you turned out like this?

313
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,520
And how about now? Are you sure?

314
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,440
Huh?

315
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,000
You’re sure now, right?

316
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,800
Yes, I’m sure now.

317
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,600
Ok then. I’m leaving now.

318
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,560
Hey... Armin is with you, right?

319
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,480
Hmph... Your friend gives me a headache every day.

320
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,360
So damn annoying.

321
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
Uh…Hello?

322
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,040
Armin, where are you?

323
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,720
Get back to the set right now!

324
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,520
How could you drive someone else’s car away like that?

325
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,680
Take it easy, sis.

326
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,360
Ah... this isn’t Armin.

327
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,440
Huh…?!?

328
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
Well then go get him on the phone, Dummy!

329
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,840
Ok.

330
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,800
Armin, Miss Lily is on the phone.

331
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Miss Lily.

332
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Yeah….Miss Lily!

333
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,240
Hello….Hello.

334
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,960
Hello! Hello! Hello, Miss Lily. Hello.

335
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,600
Hello.

336
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,480
Let's take a photo all together.

337
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,040
Hello, Ar...min.

338
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
Long time no see!

339
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
I thought you left the industry already.

340
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
Just kidding.

341
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,760
Long time no see as well!

342
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,240
Still got that same sharp tongue, huh? Haha..

343
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,720
Come, come.

344
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,360
This is Ashi. My newest star.

345
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:11,920
Yes.

346
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,800
Armin, where are you?

347
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,280
How could you run off like this?  Get back here right now!

348
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,040
Screaming like that through the phone,

349
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
I thought you had run over her father or something.

350
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,800
Your own father!

351
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I heard you!

352
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,440
Whoa... take it easy, sis.

353
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,480
It might have been an accident or something.

354
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,640
Haha... an accident?

355
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
You guys must be on drugs or something.

356
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,240
It’s like a demon possessed you to act like this. Huh,

357
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,680
I don’t know what happened to me.

358
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,880
It’s just… at that moment, I lost it. I really didn’t mean to.

359
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,160
Well… now that you realize it, hurry up and get back here!!

360
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
Ugh, forget about continuing to shoot!!

361
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,440
We're done for the day!

362
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,800
Hey, just wait a moment. Don’t call it a day yet

363
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Wrap it up! They’ve called it a day, did you hear that? Huh?

364
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
They’re gonna come after me for the damages!

365
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,800
You get back here and make up for this right now, you jinx!

366
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,880
We’ve been waiting on you just to wrap this whole thing up.

367
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,600
They won’t even let us recast your role
because your character is continuity critical!

368
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,440
You better remember this,
because there’s no way you’re getting the next role.

369
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,120
Can you stop talking for a second, please?!

370
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,280
I…

371
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
I don’t know what crazy thing happened to me.

372
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,800
When I woke up, I was just there…

373
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,800
in this body, in my own past.

374
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah enough with the crazy talk.

375
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,520
I’ll deal with the production crew myself.

376
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,320
That’s it.

377
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,280
Ugh!!! Wake up already, damn it!

378
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
Wake up! Wake up, finally!

379
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,240
Are you out of your mind?

380
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,760
I need to rest.

381
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,280
Is this the rental room I used to live in?

382
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,920
November 15, 1999.

383
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,680
I have to play an extra role with just one line of dialogue.

384
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,120
I’m so nervous.

385
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,280
I hope the shoot goes smoothly.

386
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,600
For the next project, I hope I get more lines so I can earn a higher salary.

387
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,320
Amen.

388
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
I've traveled back to the past.

389
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,680
Into my own life.

390
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,000
Fate is playing a cruel joke.

391
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,120
I should be dead.

392
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,960
Stop this pain that I still remember so clearly.

393
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,520
But I'm still standing here, watching this pathetic life of mine again.

394
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,240
Why give me an opportunity I didn't want?

395
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,240
Why?

396
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,760
You shouldn't rush back to heavy work like this.

397
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,440
Is it really a good idea to let Armin see you?

398
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,160
Just do as I say.

399
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,400
I want to know why you went there...

400
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,360
It’s like...

401
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,760
You knew you would meet him there.

402
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't know either.

403
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,840
All I knew was that I had to hurry there.

404
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,280
That's all.

405
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,920
It seems like you’ve taken quite a liking to this one, haven’t you?

406
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,360
Why don’t you offer him what you’ve offered me?

407
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,880
You make me famous in return for my body.

408
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,760
It will be an exchange.

409
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,240
I want to rest now.

410
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,880
Can you forget those rules?

411
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,880
Please don't make me feel uncomfortable like everyone else.

412
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,680
Mr. Tada.

413
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,920
See the guests out.

414
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Min.

415
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,080
Armin.

416
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,200
Armin.

417
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,720
Wake up... wake up, wake up, wake up, Min.

418
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,960
Min.

419
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,120
Min.

420
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,240
Miss Lilly sent me to drag you to the set.

421
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,480
She said you need to reshoot a scene from yesterday for her.

422
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,800
Are you awake yet?

423
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,040
Wake up already! I'll wait downstairs.

424
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Hurry up, Min!

425
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,600
Europe is interested in doing business with us.

426
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
What do you think?

427
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Look at the offer

428
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,440
and weight the pros and cons carefully.

429
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
Asia is still the main market.

430
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
However Europe is a great opportunity,

431
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,840
but cultural differences might make us work twice as hard.

432
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,720
Hello, Ms. Phawadee.

433
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Mr. Thiwthit.

434
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,400
Where is Tada?!

435
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,680
Oh…let me check for you, Ma’am.

436
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,040
You can't enter right now.

437
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,320
Mr. Tada is currently in a meeting.

438
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm sorry, you can't enter right now.

439
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,160
Would you excuse us.

440
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,440
Oh yes, certainly yes.

441
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
What’s with this termination letter?

442
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,320
I’ve personally looked at this letter myself.

443
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,640
There shouldn't be anything difficult to understand.

444
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,400
Hey you.

445
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,200
Should I call security now, Mr. Tada?

446
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,880
In any case, I am the wife of the president.

447
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,520
That is a personal matter of my father’s,

448
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,480
and I don't think it will be a problem with the management of Crown.

449
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,400
But anyway,

450
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,360
I believe my father would understand well
the effort to help our company move forward.

451
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,320
Which is not embezzlement.

452
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,680
Mother.

453
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,720
The fact that I let you go is already very kind of me.

454
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,880
You and your child have received what you deserve.

455
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,239
And I think that is more than enough.

456
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,560
Hey!!

457
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,960
This has gone too far, Brother.

458
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,560
You are just a small part of Crown Enterprise.

459
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,280
But it would be better if we didn't consider ourselves related.

460
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,480
If you're done with your business,

461
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,960
please feel free to leave.

462
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,000
He thinks that just because he's the president of Crown,
he can do whatever it wants?

463
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,320
Don’t worry, Mother.

464
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,200
I will make sure we rise above Crown.

465
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,600
What do you think you’re going to do?

466
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,360
I just moved some money around and I still got caught!.

467
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,200
He’s got eyes like a pineapple!!

468
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,840
He won't be number one for much longer.

469
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,520
Both Crown and Tada himself!

470
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,840
Let's go.

471
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,440
What’re you looking at?!

472
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,440
- Hello, Mr. Boy.
- Hello.

473
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,800
Actually, I brought a new member to introduce.

474
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,680
How is this person? The name is... Uhm... N' Ar... Ah..."

475
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
Oh... Armin, hey!

476
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,240
Wow, you... You really made a mess for me yesterday.

477
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Assistant, come here, take him and get him changed quickly!

478
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,880
Oh, wow!

479
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,040
The little troublemaker is here!

480
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
Where have you been?

481
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah, go and handle him.

482
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
What did you do yesterday?

483
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,800
Now it's causing me trouble.

484
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,680
Go, hurry up and change, then come back.

485
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,600
Hey!!

486
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Hey, check wardrobe for him, will you?

487
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,920
Hey, are you done yet? Hurry up, we're shooting!

488
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,600
Mr. Boy, here he is.

489
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,760
Come over here.

490
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,760
How is he? His build is pretty good.

491
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,040
- This is  A...chi.
- Hello.

492
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,160
Hey, set that up over there, hurry up.

493
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Clear it all those crates and baskets.

494
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,120
Hey, cameraman, where the hell are you?
Hurry up and set up the camera!

495
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,640
What’s with all these crates?

496
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,520
Oh!

497
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
Miss Lily…

498
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,240
Tuck in your pinky first!

499
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,920
Can you even act like a leading man?

500
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,640
Ugh!

501
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,960
Hey, come here.

502
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,760
Sit here.

503
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,400
Hey, play back for him to watch.

504
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,560
Ha.Ha… you ignorant brat.

505
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,320
Shut up!!

506
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,320
I'll avenge your life with my own life!

507
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,560
CUT!

508
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,160
Sorry. Sorry.

509
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,600
Just one simple line and you can’t deliver it?

510
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Ugh, look at this, the whole crew is waiting for just you!

511
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,920
Do you see how you acted?!

512
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,280
Even with the simplest cue, you still messed it up.
You can't even get the lines right.

513
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,240
Who the hell cast you?

514
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, you wanted an extra who looks good but is cheap, so...

515
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,400
This is what you get

516
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,320
Yeah right, saving on the  budget…
and look where that got me, huh?

517
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,080
You made me have to reshoot over and over!.

518
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,360
I apologize again.

519
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,880
I won't make the same mistake.

520
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,640
Yeah, let's just get it over with
so you and I can be done with all this.

521
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,560
Hey, Toey!

522
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,040
- Are you done?
- Yes, sir?

523
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,400
Next set!

524
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,840
- Hurry up!
- Yes, Sir.

525
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, nearly done

526
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,520
Uh huh.

527
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,360
Can I have the script one more time?

528
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,480
I can’t remember.

529
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,400
You still can't remember the line with just one sentence, Armin?

530
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,280
Could I read the previous scene?

531
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
And if there's a backstory, that would be great too.

532
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Did you disappear to take acting classes with Coach Sodsai or something?

533
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,880
Is that why you're asking for a backstory?

534
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,200
Hey, go take care of it for him!

535
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,600
And don’t forget to review the fight choreography with him too,
just in case we need to reshoot yesterday’s scene.

536
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,960
- Yes Sir.
- Go.

537
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
Ugh... so frustrating!

538
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,920
What a drag!

539
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,680
Mr. Boy.

540
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,840
Um... haha... or maybe, here.

541
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,160
This is Achi.

542
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,000
Hello.

543
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,120
This is my newest talent. I personally trained him.

544
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,800
He’ll be all ready for the next project for sure!

545
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,920
Can we save this for later?

546
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,880
Let’s get through this one to finish first.

547
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,760
Sigh!!!..

548
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,400
Mr. Ren, please wait for the next scene.

549
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Hey, Armin!

550
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,680
I’m ready!

551
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,600
Hey, are you ready or what? Have you heard?

552
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,320
All the main actors are about to pull out because they
have to wait for the supporting actors to get their act together.

553
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,600
This is wasting time!

554
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,240
Alright, We’re ready, the set is ready, actors,
please take your positions. Let's go, everyone ready?

555
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,520
Alright, positions first, let the actors go in first. Actors, go in first. Ah.

556
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,920
Ugh... get into position already.

557
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,760
Slate! Slate the scene now, please.

558
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,000
Please don't waste any more time.

559
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
Cut 7. Take 1

560
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,680
Five…Four…Three…Two…Action.

561
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,120
Reset.

562
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,800
Hey!!

563
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
Hey, why did you two come back?

564
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,400
What do you want?

565
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,560
I came to take back everything you stole from my family.

566
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,520
You ignorant brat.

567
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,400
Shut your mouth!!!

568
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,960
I will take revenge on you with my own life.

569
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,440
Wow!!

570
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,320
What the hell has possessed him?

571
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,240
Hey!! Take care of  him!

572
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,000
Don't!

573
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't!

574
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,000
Don't do anything crazy!

575
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
What do you want? I'll give you everything!

576
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,040
Why are you taking so long?

577
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,960
Deal with it!

578
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,920
Die already!!!

579
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,160
Brother!!!

580
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,520
No, no, no, please, no!

581
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,160
Brother, wait, wait, wait, wait!

582
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,760
Brother, calm down first.

583
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,680
You have to stay with me.

584
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,800
Brother, why are you doing this?

585
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,360
No, no, no, brother!

586
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,440
Cameraman, cameraman.

587
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,040
Move over to catch Armin's tears.

588
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,000
Brother!!!

589
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,440
Stay with me, please!

590
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,280
No, no, no!

591
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,920
No, no, no! No! Please! Please!

592
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,280
No...!!! Please, please, no...!!!

593
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,680
No, no, no!

594
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,320
No, no, no!

595
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,200
No, no, no! No! Please! Please!

596
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,560
No...!!! Please!!!

597
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,960
No, no, no! No! Please! Please!

598
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,760
No, no, no! No! Please! Please!

599
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,280
No, no, no! No! Please! Please!

600
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,440
CUT!

601
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,920
Done.

602
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,040
That’s a wrap!!!

603
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,600
It was a beautiful and amazing death.

604
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,400
That was amazing! Really impressive!

605
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,840
Thank you.

606
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,040
Great job.  Awesome.

607
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,840
Ren, who would have known that one day..

608
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,080
you'd be the one sitting there applauding for me.

609
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Thank you.

610
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,200
You were great today!

611
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,120
Thank you.

612
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,920
You're so cool, boss!

613
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,240
Out of nowhere, he just showed up on camera like that... yeah.

614
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,720
Thank you for today.

615
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,840
Thank you.

616
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,280
Hey!

617
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,600
You did great today.

618
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,040
Thank you.

619
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,920
And also, I'm sorry about yesterday.

620
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Also, for the other days when I wasn't performing well.

621
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,400
I truly apologize.

622
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,400
But I truly think that I want to become a good actor one day.

623
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,040
I will never ruin my second chance, I promise.

624
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,480
Well, at least today you did well.

625
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,320
And if you can perform like this in every scene
and not lose your cool like yesterday.

626
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,240
I can guarantee that you'll easily make it in this industry.

627
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,400
Yes sir.

628
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,320
I want to develop and keep going.

629
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,800
Excuse me, I’m going now.

630
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,640
Or is this the reason for my return?

631
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,760
Uhhh Hmmmmm.

632
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,280
Oh…get out of the way!

633
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,880
Here’s your fee, with a 30% deduction and a fee for wasted time.

634
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,040
As for the damages from yesterday,
the producer didn't charge you for that.

635
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,040
So consider it an accident.

636
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,080
Why are you looking at me that way? Is it not enough?

637
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,840
The one who is never satisfied... is not me.

638
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,640
But I'm glad to have come back and see you again
and to see that you never changed.

639
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,400
Never changed?

640
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,960
What do you mean?

641
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,360
Or looking beautiful like always?!

642
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,720
I've come back from the dead.

643
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,040
Back into my old body.

644
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,840
No one believes what happened to me.

645
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,960
I just want to know if God determines our fate…

646
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,480
Why bring me back?

647
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,240
If rebirth is a sacred blessing for all things

648
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,960
I have to find the answer to this rebirth of mine.

649
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,160
Thai News, Issue No.16 November 1999.

650
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,080
You…

651
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,400
You who once helped me.

652
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,760
Let's just say it's a token of thanks for helping me.

653
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,640
I still haven’t thanked you for helping me.

654
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,200
If what happened that day was just a coincidence.

655
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,200
Then what about today?

656
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,320
What are you doing around here?

657
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,880
I live around this area too.

658
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,920
Would you call this a coincidence?

659
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
You look too rich to live around here.

660
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,480
I once bought a unit around here to rent out for profit.

661
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,120
And I’m hoping that the land value in this area will rise in the future.

662
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,280
The prices of goods always go up and down,
but land is the only thing that keeps rising.

663
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,000
However, after the Tom Yum Kung Crisis, everything changed, you know.

664
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,120
I guess so, because my fate has truly changed as well.

665
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,360
Because as far as I can remember, in the past.

666
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,040
I’ve never met you.

667
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,720
What do you mean by that?

668
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,520
Just a film script.

669
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,320
Uh...

670
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,800
I’m an actor.

671
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,000
You might not be familiar with my face.

672
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,080
Because...

673
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,960
Because, in my memory, I’m just an up-and-coming actor.

674
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,720
But I've made up my mind that I will come back
and become a famous actor.

675
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,400
Remember my name.

676
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,240
My name is Armin.

677
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,080
Armin.

678
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,080
I will remember that.

679
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,080
Are you not going to introduce yourself?

680
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,000
You’re the Mr. Mysterious Gentleman, huh?

681
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,360
I'll tell you...

682
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,440
when we meet again.

683
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,000
Until we meet again.

684
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,280
Do you want me to take you home?

685
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,480
I've never let someone I don't even know the name of take me home.

686
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,840
I'm the type of person who finds it hard to trust others.

687
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,760
That's just how old people are.

688
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,960
Is that so?

689
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,720
Never mind.

690
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,680
I hope that whatever it is, it will bring us together again soon.

691
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,560
Good Night.

692
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,200
Am I smiling?

693
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,360
How long has it been since I felt like this?

694
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,280
In past life, sometime around the year 1999…

695
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,320
Yes Sir.

696
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,200
Armin, you didn't pass the audition.

697
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,080
Maybe you can audition again next time.

698
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,080
I didn't get the part?

699
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,480
Practice your pronunciation, listen to yourself.

700
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,280
TD, your fanclub.

701
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,600
Yes, sir.

702
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,360
Of course, sir.

703
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,120
Thank you, TD.

704
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,480
My first ever fan club.

705
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,600
My past life went so far from the starting point.

706
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,800
But this time, it has to be even better.

707
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,200
I haven't seen you drink beer like this in a long time.

708
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,640
It helps me sleep well.

709
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,640
Yeah, Weinai.

710
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,640
Tomorrow please help me buy a unit in the same building as Armin.

711
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,400
It’s going beyond what you said about not getting too involved in his life.

712
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,200
I already told you, just do as I say.

713
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,200
Yes Sir.

714
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,160
Yes, sir.

715
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,520
Thank you.

716
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,680
TD.

717
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,120
My first ever fan club.

718
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,360
Min.

719
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,480
Hey Armin.

720
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,200
Min.

721
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,680
Min.

722
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,480
Min.

723
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,840
Where's your phone?

724
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,440
Did you sink it in water or something?
I’ve been trying to call you but couldn’t get through!

725
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:34,920
Uh... what?

726
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
I knew it. The battery's dead.

727
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Where's the charger?

728
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
Go! Hurry up and get changed!

729
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,240
Get dressed for what?

730
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,320
Hmph... We're going to your series wrap-up party  tonight, remember?

731
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,160
Huh.

732
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, P'Toey, the assistant director, ordered food
from my place for the party.

733
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,960
He tried calling you but couldn't get through, so he called me instead.

734
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,400
He said you’re going to the party tonight too,
and told me to go with you.

735
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,840
I don't  even remember that I have to go to the wrap-up party for this series.

736
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,360
Yeah, you can stop with the Alzheimer's now.

737
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,440
They never told you, so how could you remember?

738
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,520
I think this one's fine.

739
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,480
But doesn't your manager know about this?

740
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,360
I think they're hiding it and didn't bother telling you.

741
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,360
Go, hurry up and get dressed.

742
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,560
Hurry up, I’m going to deliver food to a customer first.

743
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,880
Hurry up, Armin!

744
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,880
Hey, Armin.

745
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,640
Go get dressed, go get dressed!

746
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,920
A return to change.

747
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Change the old me into…

748
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,160
A new person.

749
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,640
Hey…it’s Armin….Hey…Hey.

750
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,280
Hello.

751
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,320
Yesterday, you played a death scene, and today,
it's like you’re a completely different person!

752
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,880
Hey, bro. My kid.

753
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,440
Ha... ha. Oops!

754
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,680
If you had played well and looked good like this from the start.

755
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,720
You would've been the lead actor already!

756
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,480
Hey everyone, let’s celebrate today!

757
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,440
If anyone’s not drunk.

758
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,680
I’ll make sure we do a reshoot for all of you!

759
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:50,840
Come Come Come. Let’s party!

760
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,680
Hurry up, go go go

761
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,080
Come on, get your glass!

762
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:54,720
Go Go Go.

763
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,360
Come on…Hurry in.

764
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,520
Hey…

765
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,120
You dare show up at this party?

766
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:04,840
Huh.

767
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,880
I made a mistake.

768
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,000
I  took responsibility for it.

769
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,760
Why wouldn’t I dare to come?

770
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,280
But you, on the other hand...

771
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,680
Do you think what you did is good?

772
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,560
Huh? Me.

773
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,640
What did I do?

774
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,080
You know what you did.

775
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,600
What you're doing isn't just about not telling me about today's wrap party.

776
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,720
- In past life, sometime around the year 1999…
- Miss. Lilly, is it true that I don't have any work at all these days?

777
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:32,280
Oh, please don't bother me right now. I'm in a hurry! Oh no.

778
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,960
Miss Lily, is there no work at all?

779
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,680
I mean, I'm willing to do anything, just let me know.

780
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
Hey, don't bother me right now. I'm working.

781
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,240
P'Lilly, let me handle the backstage.

782
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,400
I really have no money left.

783
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,000
You would do anything at all?

784
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,680
Yes.

785
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,720
Well, there is a job that pays well and doesn’t really require any skill.

786
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,200
You're Tall, Good body.

787
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,960
Fresh…You got it all!

788
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,160
If you want to make money, I can find someone to take care of you.

789
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,240
Are you interested?

790
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,880
Is this the kind of work you do?

791
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,840
Oh, don't be so naïve. It's just having a meal together
and maybe a little something more afterward.

792
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,440
If  they like you, they might even help boost your fame.

793
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,000
So picky, seriously.

794
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,600
I sell my talent, not my body.

795
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,840
I would  be a supporting actor for the rest of my life if I had to.

796
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,480
Instead of destroying my dignity as an actor.

797
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,480
Ha..Ha…being an extra until you die.

798
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,800
Really?

799
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,360
Then I will wait for that day that you…..die.

800
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,240
Don't follow me.

801
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,960
I’m sick of your face!

802
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,960
What you did, why did you do it?

803
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:24,280
What did i do?

804
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,600
- Why did you ruin me?
- What did i do?

805
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:26,920
Why?

806
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,720
Stop it!

807
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,520
Are you crazy? Just because I didn't invite you to the event.

808
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,120
You're acting this crazy?

809
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,880
You want to know the reason?

810
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,840
It's because I can’t stand your face.

811
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:47,600
And don't think that getting to play two scenes will make you a superstar.

812
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:53,240
Without me, you'd probably just remain an extra.

813
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,520
Come on Achi.

814
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,240
Wait for the director to start the party!

815
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,720
Achi is here.

816
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,280
Everyone this is Achi.

817
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,000
Introducing Achi, an up and coming star.

818
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,360
Life in the entertainment industry must be like this.

819
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,560
In the beautiful lights.

820
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,840
Full of competition, vying for position.

821
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,600
And ready to destroy each other.

822
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,960
- Congratulations Armin.
- Congratulations.

823
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:30,840
Thank you.

824
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,280
Thank you. Thanks.

825
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,880
But in the end.

826
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,120
Being a beautiful star in the sky,

827
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,320
A drink?

828
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,200
- is still my dream.
- I’m a fan!

829
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,280
Just come home with me, huh?

830
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,360
Where are you going?

831
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,680
Or do you like it in public?

832
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,120
Come on…no..

833
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,520
If not here, then come with me.

834
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,120
Ashi, this is the one who Lily is seriously mentoring.

835
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,880
Hey…stop it. Come on Ashi, come with me!

836
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,720
Who is this?

837
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,800
It's nothing, Just a colleague from the same agency.

838
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,880
Your manager told you to come with me, right?

839
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,440
Okay…Okay.

840
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,440
Don't make me wait long.

841
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,480
No more waiting…Come on…let’s go.

842
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,560
Huh…what a hassle.

843
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,600
Ashi, let’s go.

844
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,560
Come with me.

845
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,320
What the hell is wrong with you.

846
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,520
You’re just an EXTRA. Stay out of my business
and don’t go telling anyone about it!

847
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,360
How should I tell you?

848
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,400
That you'll only be famous for a little while.

849
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,920
And after that...

850
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,680
This kind of feeling.

851
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,000
If this feeling is from being poisoned.

852
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,600
Then my death might not have been an accident.

853
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
For Armin.

854
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,640
For Armin.

855
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,840
It’s really good.

856
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,120
Armin.

857
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,240
You...

858
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,720
- The incident that happened before Thada met Armin.
- I will take revenge on you with my own life.

859
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,640
Mr. Armin died so realistically.

860
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,920
Stay with me for a moment, Brother.

861
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:31,359
No, no, no, don't.

862
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,800
No, no.

863
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,800
No, no.

864
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,600
No, no.

865
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,680
Brother.

866
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,439
Yes.

867
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,920
It seems too real.

868
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,040
Just Armin's performance can hurt me this much.

869
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,359
I won't just be someone who watches him anymore.

870
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,040
Where is Armin now?

871
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
As far as I know.

872
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:05,279
This evening, Armin, will be attending
the wrap-up party for The Throne series.

873
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,520
Wanna come in for a swim?

874
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,560
Or are you scared?

875
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,120
In this life,

876
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,560
I have nothing left to fear.
