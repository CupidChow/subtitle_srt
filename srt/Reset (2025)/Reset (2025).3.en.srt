1
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,040
- In past life, 1999.
- Grilled meatball skewers!

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,920
- In a past life — B.E. 2542 (1999 A.D.)
- Peanuts anyone?

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,079
- In past life, 1999.
- You wanted 5 skewers, right?

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,280
- In past life, 1999.
- 10 baht for 1 skewer.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
We also have fried bananas.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Really delicious too!

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,680
Peanuts anyone?

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,480
Really tasty.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,320
- Ohhhh…wow!
- Nice and hot!

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,240
Ah….!!! It’s Mr. Nok

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,800
P'Nok is here. Nhoom.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,520
P'Nok is here.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,120
P'Nok is here.

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,640
I’m going to go ask for an autograph.
Wait here, ok?

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,240
Okay.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,160
Hey!!! It’s Mr. Nok, Chatchai.

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,680
Hey Min… look after our stall,
I’ll be right back.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,080
Hey…lemme help.

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,320
Hey Mr., I want to see Mr. Nok’s face.

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
Can you help me up there?

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,960
Sure.

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,320
Be careful.

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,880
I want him to know that he’s my inspiration.

24
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
He’s the reason I want to stand back up
and walk again.

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,520
Are you okay, Nhoom?

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,200
Did you get it? Did you?

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,160
Oh…

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,360
I’m sorry. I couldn’t get to him.
Too many people.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
It’s okay.

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,200
We’ll try again next event, okay?

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Okay.

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,320
It’s okay. It’s okay.
I promise… next event.

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,200
Hey… hey…

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,640
Mr. Nok. Mr. Nok

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,960
P' Nok, My brother is such a fan!

36
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Could you please give us your autograph?
Please sign it for us!

37
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
Of course.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Thank you.

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
Get well soon, ok?

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
I’m rooting for you!

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Thank you so much.

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,360
Thank you. Thank you so much.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,080
The events of that day inspired me
and gave me the courage to dream.

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
I made a firm resolution that
I would become an actor no matter what.

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,880
Even though I don’t know anything about you.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
Whenever I’m near you.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
I feel an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,640
Mr. Thiwthit has been promoted to MD of Venus.

49
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,960
Crown Enterprise might be facing a bigger problem
than it has ever dealt with before.

50
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,960
Pharit!!!

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
It really is you!!!

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,960
Aaaah! Can I have your autograph, please?

53
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,720
You know I’m filming a hidden camera show, right?

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Is this your way of trying to
cling to me for fame?

55
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,120
I just became MD and
there’s already trouble? Seriously?

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,480
Tear up his contract and fire him.

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,440
I want to stay under my Venus contract.

58
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,120
For everything I’ve messed up,
I’m truly sorry.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,079
What kind of ghost possessed you?

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
This is...

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,760
Hurry to the casting right now!

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,480
I’m Armin from Venus Company.

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,240
Venus sent someone else to replace you, Armin.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Armin!!!

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,959
Actors over here are you ready?
Go sit over there for now.

66
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,560
Hello  Hello Hello Hello Hello!!!

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Hello Mr. Liu

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Hello.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,960
Hello!!!

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,520
- This is our producer for this project.
- Ah…Hello.

71
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,440
- Hello.
- They help with the casting today

72
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,920
Great... We’ll go thru the list of talents together.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
Come on Pharit, have a seat.

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,600
This is the next one.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Is it Armin?

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,600
Looking at his profile.

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,400
He doesn’t seem qualified.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
Can he handle this?

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,400
How did he make it to the audition?

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,920
Uh… There’s no way
I would jeopardize my film project.

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,640
I selected him to audition because
I think he fits the part.

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Let’s get started.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,560
We will get to know each other,
and one day we will become rivals.

84
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,640
Rivals?

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,520
Are you crazy?

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,880
The way you approach people is unbelievable.

87
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,840
But sorry.

88
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,480
I’m not interested in getting to know attention-seekers.

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Okay, right?

90
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
It's time for us to start the audition now.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,640
- “Deep Depths”
- I will pair everyone up for the audition.

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Please get ready.

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
"The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet"

94
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
Mr. Liu!

95
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
Can I try something?

96
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,160
Sure.

97
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,920
I want to see if what you said that day.

98
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,320
If you can actually prove it to everyone
and not just talking nonsense.

99
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,520
I'll have you audition with
the stage play Romeo and Juliet.

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,800
Come here for a minute, Pharit.

101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,280
Just a moment… um… I think…

102
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,920
Let’s not make things complicated.

103
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,000
As the lead actor, I’d like to have a say in
who I’ll be working with...

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,480
This will be a good way to see
if they can really handle it.

105
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,480
But this is too difficult.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,880
The language is complicated.

107
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,920
And we don’t have time for them
to sit and memorize lines.

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,159
Do you really think these kids even…

109
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,080
Been exposed to reading this
Romeo & Juliet literature?

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,000
I ask to just keep things easy so
we can get through everything fast…Come on…

111
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
I want to try.

112
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,920
Huh…

113
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,840
The script of Romeo & Juliet is
one of my favorite scripts.

114
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
Good.

115
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
Pharit!

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,920
If you still want me to be
the lead actor in this project.

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,880
this is my first condition.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,120
Mm…

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,720
Armin, here's the thing.

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,640
I don’t have much time.
So if you can’t handle it, then just…

121
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,720
Please give me some time to understand the script.
It won’t take long.

122
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,240
Oh...

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
Alright, then assistant.

124
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
Please take the Romeo and Juliet script to
the photocopier and distribute it to everyone.

125
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,480
Then everyone will memorize
the Romeo and Juliet script.

126
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,680
We'll use this for the audition.

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Okay, Alright!

128
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,159
I want this person to audition and
I want them to get the role as well.

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,080
I watched the latest video of his performance.

130
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
And he’s really interesting.

131
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,360
But this is a lead role,
and we need an actor with high skill.

132
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,280
Otherwise, it could cause our film to fail.

133
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,000
I want him to have this part.

134
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,000
It's because I see he has the talent for it.

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Mr. Tada, if that’s what you want it will be easy.

136
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,800
I wanted to set up the audition only.

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,320
Because I wanted him to have the chance
to show off his talent for everyone to see.

138
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
But it really doesn’t matter.

139
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,760
If he is going to be casted for that role already.

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,960
It is necessary.

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,640
Because.

142
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
I want him to be proud of himself.

143
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,080
Director Liu.

144
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Oh Mr. Tada.

145
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,000
You came to the audition.

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
How is the audition going?

147
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,280
Everything isn't going according to the plan we set.

148
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,280
Now, suddenly, Pharit gave Armin
some random script to perform.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,400
The script is really long,
and the dialogue is extensive.

150
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,920
It's something new for Armin as well.

151
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,080
Armin is going to fail.

152
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,160
I want to go in and watch.

153
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,080
Mr. Tada, wait up here.

154
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,280
If he can’t do it because of others,
I’d be really disappointed.

155
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,080
"Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare

156
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
If I can’t place my trust in the truth of slumber.

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Then my dream hath whispered
glad tidings on the wind.

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Tidings from fair Verona.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,200
How fares my Juliet?

160
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
I lament to bring thee this sorrowful tidings.

161
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,400
False!

162
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,480
You shalt never attain that
which thou don’t desire.

163
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,280
Go, prepare mine steed for me.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,880
I am most certain that
he shall sell unto me the poison.

165
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
and I shall carry it hence to Juliet's tomb.

166
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,600
And employ it there.

167
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Oh Wow!!!

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
That was amazing.

169
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,200
So good.

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Very impressive, Armin.

171
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,080
Wow…In just a short amount of time
you remembered the script. Excellent

172
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Wait a minute.

173
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,640
Director Liu.

174
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
I’d like to try a scene with him.

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,360
Romeo clashes with Tybalt of the Capulet family.

176
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,880
But this scene has another important character.

177
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
Mercutio, Romeo's close friend.

178
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,160
Alright, who wants to volunteer
to perform this scene?

179
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
I’ll do it.

180
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
Give me some advice, Admin.

181
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,280
Camera ready?

182
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
5…4…3…2...

183
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Action!!!

184
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
Good morrow, kind sir, on this fair afternoon.

185
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,840
May I have a word with one of
thee for but a moment?

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
Art thou certain.

187
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
That but words shall pass between us?

188
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
Shall we duel, then? Pah!!!

189
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
Draw thy sword!

190
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Huh!!!!

191
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Hold, gentlemen,
I beseech thee—stay thy hands!

192
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Tybalt!

193
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,400
The Prince hath forbidden thee to clash
within fair Verona’s walls.

194
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,040
Mercutio!!!

195
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,200
- Mercutio, hold thy hand!
- Unhand me!

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,080
- Unhand me!
- Enough!

197
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,760
I said, enough!

198
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
I am hurt…

199
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
I am undone…

200
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
He hath fled.

201
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,120
I gave him not so much as a scratch in return!

202
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,880
Aye, and rightly so.

203
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Sam!

204
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,360
CUT!!!

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,080
Excellent!

206
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,760
How was that? Are you satisfied, Pharit?

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
I'm good.

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,600
Alright, let’s continue then!

209
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,840
Not too bad.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,280
I'm good.
You can continue with the auditioning.

211
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,440
Okay then…we’re good to go.

212
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,800
Armin.

213
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Armin, Back there did you forget
and use my real name?

214
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,880
No problem at all! Thanks so much.
You set up that scene so well for me.

215
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,520
Alright, if we're ready,
let's get back to our audition for Deep Depths.

216
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,440
So, what's next on the cue? Who’s up next?

217
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,440
You’re good.

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,600
Yep, I’m good.

219
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
Alright, I think overall it went well!

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,280
I think he’d be a great fit for the project.
I’m good with it!

221
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,720
Thank you.

222
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,040
This is my lucky charm.

223
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,360
Whenever I feel uneasy.

224
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,040
It helps me.

225
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,480
Did you do it well?

226
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you.

227
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,000
It helped me so much.

228
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,680
I see how it is! A big meal on you
to show your gratitude, then!

229
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,200
Umm…Sure.

230
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
This is my reward?

231
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
Oh yeah...

232
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,520
Well!

233
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,720
I’m starving.

234
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,240
You dragged me from the market
so early this morning.

235
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,000
And I haven't eaten anything yet?

236
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,120
This is just an appetizer.

237
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,240
But we’ll go to the market and
I’ll show off  my shopping skills to you

238
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,200
You seem really happy today.

239
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
You did well in the audition room, didn’t you?

240
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Mmmm…..Yep!

241
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,200
I got to step back into that room again.

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,160
But this time...

243
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,120
I knew what I was doing...

244
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
And why I was doing it.

245
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,880
It’s like... I finally went back and won
the game I had always been losing.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,440
The game of fate, you mean?

247
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,280
I really wish you could’ve seen it...
just how cool it was in that room.

248
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,520
I know you did great.

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,520
You speak as if you had seen it yourself.

250
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,480
Hey you…

251
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,080
Ah, yes, it's Loy Krathong today!

252
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,240
Would you be my Loy Krathong partner today?

253
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Hmmm….

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,360
Actually, I haven’t floated
a floating lantern in a long time.

255
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Back in my day, they were campaigning for...
digital floating lanterns.

256
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,760
But since we are here already.

257
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
I’ll consider it as something for you then.

258
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,400
Uh…so what is digitally floating your lanterns?

259
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,680
Floating Lanterns…Floating!!!

260
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,880
Hello.

261
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,960
Which color do you like?

262
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,320
What did you wish for?

263
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,720
Telling you will spoil the sacredness of it!

264
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,599
Come on in. Don’t be shy.

265
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Uh… Hold on one moment.

266
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,920
Um... Nevermind, it’s okay.

267
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
Uh…How about these?

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,880
Oh yeah.

269
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,640
Just put them down here.

270
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Have a seat here.

271
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
Let me set everything up.

272
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,680
You can’t find a home-cooked meal
like this just anywhere.

273
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,920
Sorry about that, you see,
There’s some news about me and Pharit lately.

274
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Going outside could easily make it into the headlines.

275
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,480
Plus, you live here, right?

276
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,200
What could be easier than having a good meal and
then just walking back so close to relax afterward?

277
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah that’s true.

278
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,560
Okay then… Come on.

279
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,360
One moment.

280
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,400
Huh?

281
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,760
Right there?

282
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,080
Why?

283
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,120
Not fancy enough for you?

284
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
No, it’s just… won’t it get too messy?

285
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
I can clean up very well.

286
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,280
What the heck?

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,000
What’s going on?

288
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,520
Is there something wrong?

289
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,280
I guess I haven’t cooked at home in a while.

290
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
The pot isn’t working.

291
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
Then we can just go eat…

292
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
You're right! We can go cook in your room!

293
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,640
My room?

294
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,560
But it’s so far from here.

295
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,720
I thought you said you lived in this building unit?

296
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,640
Uh...

297
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,560
Right… uh…

298
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
Then let’s go!

299
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,360
Wait… wait.

300
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,080
Come on… let’s go… you carry those bags.

301
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,000
You're room is so empty.

302
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,960
As if you just moved in yesterday.

303
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,600
You really want to live here, Sir?

304
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
It's quite far from Crown, Sir.

305
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Arrange to have this room made up ready to move in.

306
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,800
As soon as I can handle all the chaos at Crown.

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,520
I am going to workation here.

308
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,720
Yes, Sir.

309
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Normally I stay at another place.

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
This is a space to stay close to work.

311
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,880
In that case, may I use the kitchen?

312
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,280
Do you have a pan?

313
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,680
Here…

314
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
Oh… found it.

315
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Oh yeah… right.

316
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,160
Hmmm... and it’s brand new.

317
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
Um…

318
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
You seem quite skilled.

319
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,720
Not at all like you said you don’t cook often.

320
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,040
You like to cook don’t you?

321
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,960
I use to...

322
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
Only for someone….

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
Who was special to me.

324
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,400
How could you do this to me?!?!?!
How could you do this to me?!?!?

325
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,520
I didn’t mean to!!!

326
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,640
How many years!!!
How long have you been with him?

327
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,040
How long have you been doing this?!
I love you!!!!!

328
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,080
Listen to me first.

329
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
I love you. How could you do this?

330
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,800
Hey…!!!

331
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,880
It's the onions… I haven’t cooked in a while.

332
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,120
I wasn’t careful.

333
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,560
Let me help you.

334
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,640
I told you. I want to cook.

335
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Look…

336
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,920
I want this meal to be more special
than any you've made before.

337
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,080
Is that possible?

338
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Thank you.

339
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,320
Ummm… Stir.

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Okay.

341
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,680
Mmmm….

342
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
You really can’t find cooking like this anywhere else.

343
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,960
Come to think of it, every time we meet.

344
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,160
We’re always eating noodles…

345
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,120
Egg noodles, Noodle soup.

346
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,880
spaghetti

347
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,080
Am I right?

348
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,840
Mmm...

349
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Noodle boy with connections!

350
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,160
Next time what would you like to eat?

351
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
Ummm… Let’s have some udon.

352
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,040
Okay.

353
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,520
I’ll be waiting.

354
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,320
May I?

355
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
We still don’t have any drinks.

356
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,200
Hey…..No!!!!

357
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,280
Are you being stingy over the beer?

358
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,120
It's not like that…

359
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,080
I just think that….

360
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,080
Wine would better suit our meal.

361
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
And…

362
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
Do you have wine?

363
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,360
No…

364
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,560
Let's just drink the beer.

365
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,800
I'll order us some wine then.

366
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,240
Order wine…?

367
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,360
At this hour?

368
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
And where are you going to order from?

369
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,880
Thru an app?

370
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
There is no delivery service at this hour.

371
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,000
I have a special delivery service of my own.

372
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Right this moment, Sir?

373
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,160
Uh…Okay, Sir…I’ll have it delivered asap.

374
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,960
Sir…Yes, Sir.

375
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,840
What makes you want to drink something right now?

376
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
I thought it was some kind of delivery service.

377
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,360
Turns out... it was just your assistant delivering it.

378
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,160
That’s right. He’s my personal delivery service.

379
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,600
You're quite mysterious, you know.

380
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,800
You always manage to surprise me!

381
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,600
Like...

382
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,640
When you…

383
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,920
Like when you helped me at the party.

384
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
And you knew exactly where and
when I had to go for the audition.

385
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,120
I’m seriously asking.

386
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
How did you know all of that?

387
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,880
I know Director Liu.

388
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,240
So I knew you had an audition.

389
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,600
How did you come to know Director Liu?

390
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
You...

391
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,800
Feels like I’m playing
a 20 Questions game with you, huh?

392
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,320
Today is Loy Krathong day.

393
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,840
Do you want to play a game?

394
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,160
What kind of game?

395
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
Ah, it's like a game of spin the bottle!

396
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,840
Whoever the bottle points to has to tell the truth.

397
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,280
Are you brave enough?

398
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
I’ve never been one to back down.

399
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
Looks like we don’t have a bottle, huh?

400
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
Guess we’ll have to use this stick instead.

401
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,680
You ready?

402
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,960
How do you know Director Liu?

403
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,280
I’ve worked with him before.

404
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,440
What kind of work did you do together?

405
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,320
Stick to the Rules, You!!!

406
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,560
You have to spin….

407
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,520
The stick first…

408
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,440
What kind of work have you done with Director Liu?

409
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,120
I work in the industry too, you know.

410
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,720
Enough already!

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,920
I know you’re cheating.

412
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,840
You used your finger to block the stick.

413
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,520
Stopping it on my side from the very first round.

414
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,560
Then why did you answer?

415
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,760
Well, it’s like in the business world, you know.

416
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,240
The first person to do something wrong is
often the one who ends up at a disadvantage.

417
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,960
As of right now, you have to do as I ask.

418
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,040
Go ahead.

419
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
It's your turn. What do you want?

420
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,840
Why don’t you guess what it is that I want.

421
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
If I’m not being too biased.

422
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,200
I think...

423
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,160
You should ask for...

424
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,160
I want to be yours.

425
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,160
I want to be someone special to you.

426
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,320
I want to be the one who’s part of your life story.

427
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,560
now and forever.

428
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
I want to take care of you.

429
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,880
By your side, like this.

430
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,080
Am I asking for too much?

431
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,720
This... it's not asking.

432
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,560
You’ve given me more than that.

433
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,000
I think you’re drunk.

434
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Mm...

435
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
Go to sleep. Aren’t you sleepy yet, boy?

436
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,320
Do you like coming up here?

437
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,440
Whenever I come up here.

438
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,880
I feel at ease.

439
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
Is there anything else you’d like to ask me?

440
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Just telling me what you want to share, is enough.

441
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,520
A story you want me to share?

442
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,040
It's all just headaches.

443
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,640
Right now, Venus is ready to dump me at any moment.

444
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,160
My manager is always ready to stab me in the back.

445
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,680
And if I don't make it through the audition for this movie.

446
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,160
I’ll probably be left waiting on work for a long time.

447
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
I’ve been given a second chance at life.

448
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,160
So why do I have to face the same old issues again?

449
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,960
Hey.

450
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,320
Hey... you’re talking about
being reborn again, aren’t you?

451
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
In actuality.

452
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,400
In 25 years.

453
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,120
I'll be an uncle in my 40s.

454
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,840
Who has passed away and
come back to life in this body.

455
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Is this a sci-fi movie plot, you’re talking about?

456
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,080
If you don't believe it, that’s fine.

457
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,800
Sigh... But it’s true, though.

458
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,160
If it were turned into a movie.

459
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
It would actually sound pretty interesting.

460
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
But i think it’s a good thing.

461
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,760
Because if I hadn’t been reborn...

462
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,240
I probably wouldn’t have met you.

463
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
I think it’s more like fate.

464
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,720
That brought us both together.

465
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,440
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

466
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,360
♫ Like a book already written ♫

467
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,520
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

468
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,960
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

469
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,200
♫ The day I found you ♫

470
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,120
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

471
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,120
♫ It was fate that drew the line, making me love you ♫

472
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,840
♫ I believe that ♫

473
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,920
I really want to know.

474
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,000
♫ If that day we hadn’t met ♫

475
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,680
- If there’s something you're still keeping from me.
- ♫ if I had simply overlooked you ♫

476
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,360
- If there’s something you're still keeping from me.
- ♫ Would things have changed? ♫

477
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
♫ Even if the story were different, ♫

478
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
♫ I think we'd still be the same, ♫

479
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
- When are you going to tell me?
- ♫ I think we'd still be the same, ♫

480
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,880
- When are you going to tell me?
- ♫  nothing would change ♫

481
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,280
♫ Even if I turned back time 
and start over countless times, ♫

482
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,880
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

483
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,520
♫ Every time I meet you ♫

484
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,160
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

485
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,320
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

486
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,200
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

487
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,560
♫ The moment I look into your eyes ♫

488
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,760
♫ Believe me, I will love you the same ♫

489
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,240
Ohhhh...

490
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,560
Can i have another glass….

491
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,080
Enough already, You!

492
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,880
Come on.

493
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,760
Get some sleep.

494
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,720
You can’t handle anymore?

495
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,800
Hey!!!

496
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,600
You...

497
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,679
Huhhh.

498
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,760
I thought you’d be bold enough.

499
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
A kid is always a kid…

500
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,960
Hmmm.

501
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
You can't outlast this old man!

502
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Crown Enterprises.

503
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,400
Tada Mekasawakul, Chairman of the company.

504
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,880
Who are you, really?

505
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,360
The Chairman of Crown Enterprises.

506
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,080
Ahhh!!! Phat.

507
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,680
Ohhh!!! I'm all wet!!!

508
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,960
You idiot!!! Snap out of your daydreaming!

509
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,080
Do you mean Chairman of some charity event?

510
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,400
The Crown Enterprise Chairman is
worth hundreds of millions, even billions.

511
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
Why on earth would he stay in a dump like that?

512
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,320
He really has a room there.

513
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,880
If you don't believe me, go see for yourself.

514
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,480
Huh!!!

515
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
Who’s that?

516
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,320
Read it.

517
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,720
Tada Mekasawakul.

518
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,920
Come on, give it back. Auntie.

519
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,880
But do you and auntie think it's weird,
or just a coincidence?

520
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,760
Dude, this isn’t a coincidence anymore.

521
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,720
This is what you call Mission: Impossible!

522
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,360
like one of those rich-heir protagonists.

523
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
Tam tam tam-tam-tam, tam tam tam tam tam.

524
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,920
Who floats down from above…Poof

525
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,680
Tam tam tam-tam-tam.

526
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,880
And moves into a cheap rental room.

527
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,480
Oh wow... this can't be real.

528
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,280
By the way... you and the Chairman, huh?

529
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
How intense is it between you two, buddy?

530
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,680
It's not as intense as you think.

531
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But it seems special.

532
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,240
But don't you think it's...

533
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,560
Kind of strange that someone like him
would like someone like me?

534
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,840
It's really hard to believe, huh?

535
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,640
But I think people at Crown Enterprise
must have peculiar taste.

536
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,760
Why do you say that?

537
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
Their company is so far away.

538
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,920
Yet they always call to have food from
Aunt's restaurant delivered to their office.

539
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,800
There are plenty of restaurants around there.

540
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,920
But they've become fond of Aunt Jeed’s cooking.

541
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
Do you think their taste is strange?

542
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,760
Don’t you think it’s peculiar.

543
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,880
Does that mean...

544
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,080
Tada has been a part of my life since a past life?

545
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,960
Wait, Auntie...

546
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,280
How come I never knew about this?

547
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,520
It was back when you disappeared from the shop.

548
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,640
Off to shoot some scene in
that cheesy drama or whatever.

549
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,000
I had to make Phat deliver food to him for years!

550
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,000
Yep…

551
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,560
Yeah… Phat!

552
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
It’s time to put some ice on the fresh ingredients hurry!

553
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,000
Auntie.

554
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
When will Crown order food for delivery again?

555
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
How can I help you?

556
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,080
I'm from Jeed's Underground Kitchen.
I'm here to deliver food.

557
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,120
Uh... about the payment for the food,
please wait a moment.

558
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,720
I'll call them to check.
They didn't leave it with me.

559
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Ok. Thank you

560
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,680
At that time, I had not yet joined Crown.

561
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,720
I was at Venus, the known rival company.

562
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,640
In past life.

563
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,960
Where is the overdue rent? Pay up!!!

564
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,280
Here.

565
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
The rent for this month.

566
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,680
And don't pay late next month.

567
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,080
I've been out of work lately.

569
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,280
And I probably won't be here next month.

570
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
Continue to rent the room.

571
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,640
I… will pay for it myself.

572
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,360
Your wife?

573
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,680
Who are you talking about… WIFE?

574
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,120
Not his wife.

575
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,920
But I am the one who will offer a good proposal to Armin.

576
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,280
So he can have everything he wants.

577
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,440
Here.

578
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,880
The rent money for next month.

579
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,920
Excuse me… You’ve gotten your money.
Do you mind leaving.

580
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,560
Both of us have some business to discuss
without your presence.

581
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,280
Please go on your way.

582
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,800
Hello, Armin.

583
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,680
How do you know my name?

584
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,480
Are you from the Bank?

585
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,240
Or if you're here to sell something,
I don't have the money to buy it.

586
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,840
Look at my face, my smooth skin,
and this great shape.

587
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,960
I'm definitely not a banker or here to sell anything.

588
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,560
I… am going to be your manager.

589
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,040
Hello...

590
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,480
I'm Janine.

591
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,480
Come on, give me your hand!

592
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,640
Manners, right?

593
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,960
This is your contract and a list of all the jobs
you'll have to audition for.

594
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,280
After the day Janine started managing me.

595
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,000
It seemed like many things began to change.

596
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,840
Here I am…

597
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm here.

598
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,280
How much.

599
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,400
You have to pay the young man standing over there.

600
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,560
Who?

601
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,360
Over there.

602
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,360
Oh…

603
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,720
Janine.

604
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,480
Oh..!!! My!!!!

605
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,480
Wait, wait a moment...

606
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,800
Have we met before?

607
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,640
But I don’t think we’ve met before.

608
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,280
Ah...

609
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,960
In due time.

610
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,360
Huh? What is In due time?

611
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,960
Oh...

612
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,200
Oh, here you go.

613
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,240
No need for change.

614
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,760
I prepared the exact amount.

615
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,320
You want your money, right?

616
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,920
Why didn't you say that from the start, gosh.

617
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,920
Well… Okay then.

618
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,000
Miss Janine.

619
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,360
Yes.

620
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,160
They’re waiting for the food.

621
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,920
Oh my goodness…

622
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,480
Thank you, dear.

623
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,520
I'm coming, I’m coming.

624
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:29,920
On my way.

625
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,000
Excuse me. Thank you.

626
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,520
Yes.

627
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,320
Yes, Miss Lily.

628
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,000
Armin...

629
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,240
Where are you?

630
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,520
Come to Venus right now.

631
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,120
The new executive, Mr. Thiwthit,
wants to meet you.

632
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,040
Is it necessary for him to meet me?

633
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,560
If you don't come now.

634
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,280
You won't have to come back here again.

635
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:09,920
That's all!!!

636
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,520
Lily…

637
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
Pause all of Armin's work.

638
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,360
Because you went to the audition
without informing Venus.

639
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,080
Yes, Sir.

640
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,480
As per the contract.

641
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,600
Venus has the right to make
decisions regarding your work.

642
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
Because if we find that you're not suitable.

643
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,240
We can send someone else in your place.

644
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,760
Therefore…

645
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,800
Lily is not at fault.

646
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,400
But the person who is…

647
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,160
...Is you, for going to the audition
without informing Venus.

648
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,320
Listen closely…

649
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,920
I don't like it when people overstep their boundaries.

650
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,200
And even if you pass the audition.

651
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,160
Venus won't allow you to take the job.

652
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,080
But if you insist on doing it...

653
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,720
Venus will sue you for all that you have.

654
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,400
By doing this.

655
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,240
Are you deliberately using the contract to torment me?

656
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,760
Just tear up my contract then.

657
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,880
Well... wasn't it you who didn't want me
and Venus to cancel your contract?

658
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,240
You change your mind so easily.

659
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,040
You want to be a freelance actor, do you?

660
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,880
In that case, tear up the contract and pay the hefty fine.

661
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,040
And if you can't pay.

662
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,600
I’m sure you know what will happen.

663
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,600
And Crown will be sued...

664
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,120
If they continue forcing you to work on this project.

665
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,800
You are the product for which I hold the rights of.

666
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,760
Remember that.

667
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,160
Even though it seemed like everything had changed.

668
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,080
Events ended up repeating just like in my past life.

669
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,680
As if nothing had really changed at all.

670
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,960
Seriously though.

671
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,120
What’s so special about you?

672
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,040
That makes my brother
so infatuated with you like this?

673
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,480
Mr. Tada is your older brother?

674
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,240
I never knew this before.

675
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,800
Soon, you'll get to know me better.

676
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
Including Tada as well.

677
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,520
Hey Min.

678
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,960
If it gets too much for you.

679
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,680
Why not retire from the industry
and do something else?

680
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't want to do anything else.

681
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,240
I want to be an actor.

682
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,680
Why does life keep throwing
all these challenges at me again?

683
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,440
Auntie.

684
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,560
Look at Min.

685
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,600
He's stressing out like an old person.

686
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,240
Just like you.

687
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,480
Oops!!!

688
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,600
Phat!!!

689
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,240
You and your big mouth ruined it.

690
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,880
So, what should we do now, Auntie?

691
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,800
Ah.

692
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Let's get started.

693
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,440
Mmmm.

694
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,240
Quick, bring the ice.

695
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,400
Auntie!

696
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,240
This won't help any.

697
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,040
Just try first.

698
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,800
Take a sip... Ahem...

699
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,360
You'll soon know if it can be fixed or not.

700
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,400
Hey!!! Ah huh…

701
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,440
Phat!

702
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,000
I told him to drink, not you! Well...

703
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,680
You're the first one to start, huh?

704
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Ahh... my throat is dry.

705
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,840
Drink to relieve the tension.

706
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,120
Cheers!!!

707
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,400
Relieve the tension.

708
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,240
Drink until it all fades away.

709
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,920
Mmmm...

710
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,640
Good stuff.

711
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,720
In my past life.

712
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,240
Even though my contract got put on hold.

713
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,520
I still have some small
supporting roles to get some experience.

714
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,280
And some connections.

715
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,600
But in this life.

716
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,040
I'm being targeted like this.

717
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,080
So what should I do?

718
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,080
Huh?

719
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,440
What do people usually do in situations like this?

720
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,680
Huh…

721
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,600
What's he rambling on about?

722
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,800
Everything is going to be the same again.

723
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,760
No matter what path I choose.

724
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,560
Everything just keeps looping back to the way it was.

725
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,280
So what am I supposed to do.

726
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,400
Phat? What should I do, huh? What should I do?

727
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,520
You just have to… Cheers!

728
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,560
Come on.

729
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,320
Cheers!!!

730
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,120
What is it, Wenai.

731
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,560
What's the status on the wine I ordered?

732
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,960
Almost there.

733
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,880
But along the way, I came across
something interesting about Armin.

734
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,680
No matter which path I choose...

735
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,120
Everything turns out the same again.

736
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,320
The future repeats itself once more.

737
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,960
Huh...

738
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,520
Why did I come back into the past then?

739
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,360
And how do you know about the future?

740
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,160
I know...

741
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,200
More about the future than you do, Auntie.

742
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,640
Remember this, Auntie.

743
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,560
It's in 2011, right here.

744
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,880
It’s going to flood.

745
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,520
Bangkok is going to flood.

746
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,440
You're really working hard to curse me, huh?

747
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,120
Phat, take him home already.

748
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,240
Don’t no, Auntie.

749
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,440
Today, I have to watch Manchester United
fight for the third time championship.

750
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,200
Hey, hey, hey...

751
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,400
no need to worry about
the triple championship anymore.

752
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
Manchester United will win the triple championship.

753
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,320
And you are going to celebrate for 3 days and 3 nights.

754
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,920
And how do you know all this…?

755
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,880
Coz I'll be celebrating with you.

756
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,600
Hey, hey…

757
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,160
I'm begging you.

758
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,160
Go home Min.

759
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,280
I receive you request.

760
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,960
Good.

761
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,800
But i’m not going home.

762
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,600
Come. Come...

763
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,480
We should have never started!

764
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,160
This booze is all gone.

765
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,880
But don't worry—I'll take care of it myself.

766
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,520
He’s not going home…

767
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,040
Armin!!!

768
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,480
So handsome…

769
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,200
Who are you?

770
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,200
That’s Mr. Tada, Auntie.

771
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,600
That's Armin’s condominium neighbor.

772
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,880
Mr… Ta… da…

773
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,360
Yes, Ma’am. I’m Tada, Armin’s neighbor.

774
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,760
Are you okay?

775
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,000
Mr. Tada…

776
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,240
It's good that you showed up.

777
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,760
Do you know...

778
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,800
That your younger brother said
he would sue me if I took the job?

779
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,600
I won’t back down! Go ahead and sue me.

780
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
I’ll keep going after him relentlessly.

781
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,840
I won’t give in. Get out of my way!!!

782
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,640
Hey!!!

783
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,760
Armin!!!

784
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,680
Just let me go.

785
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,000
Hey you…

786
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,480
I want to get more beer.

787
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,160
Armin I think you’ve had too much to drink.

788
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,200
Phat.

789
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,520
That’s your friend over there.

790
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,800
When he’s drunk, he can get pretty flirty, huh.

791
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,040
Exactly, Auntie.

792
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,480
Why is it that when I see something like this... it’s...

793
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,640
Makes me ticklish inside.

794
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,840
Mr. Tada.

795
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,000
In that case...

796
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,120
Could you drop him off at home as well, please?

797
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,200
Please take care of my friend.

798
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,440
You don’t have to worry.

799
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,680
I will take care of Armin myself.

800
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,240
Phat, the more I listen to him, the more it... tickles…

801
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,800
We're almost there.

802
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh... Hey!!!

803
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,480
Armin.

804
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,280
Careful... please.

805
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,680
We're almost there.

806
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,480
I'm sorry for making things difficult for you.

807
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,520
But I can’t walk straight.

808
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,960
Don't worry… I’m strong.

809
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,720
That's right.

810
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,080
Someone like you, being young,
must have a lot of energy.

811
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,080
Yep…

812
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,160
Young man…

813
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,240
Oh!!! Armin.

814
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,400
Just a little further… that’s it.

815
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,320
Whoa… hey hey...

816
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,080
Almost there, almost there…

817
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,680
A bit more.

818
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,520
Oh…..

819
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,080
Oh... hold on.

820
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,000
Okay, nice and slow.

821
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,640
- Hey you!!!
- My pillow???

822
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,600
Here…the pillow is here.

823
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,080
Ugh!!!

824
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,920
Hey…wait a minute. Take it easy.

825
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,200
- Hey!!! What’s it stuck on?
- Hey... wait, wait.

826
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,640
I'll help.

827
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,520
Uh... Take... take off... the shirt...

828
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,360
It's... it's hot...

829
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,280
Hold on. Ahhh…

830
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,120
Hey you!!! You’ll fall off the bed.

831
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,840
Hey you!!!!

832
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,680
Thank you.

833
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,720
And sorry.

834
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,840
Sorry?

835
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,920
Why are you apologizing.

836
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,400
Thank you for taking me to the audition.

837
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,880
But I can't play the role.

838
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,720
Thank you so much. Mr. Tada.

839
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,280
- It's because of your brother.
- Oh!!! You...

840
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,640
Oh!!!

841
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,560
Why are you all playing games with my life?

842
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,800
You gave me an opportunity and
then your brother comes to ruin it.

843
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,680
What do you want with my life?!!!

844
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,680
You mean Thiwthit?

845
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,160
Please turn off the lights too.

846
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,720
Charlie...

847
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,760
Charlie!!!

848
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:36,320
Wenai, please help check the contract
between Armin and Venus. ASAP, please

849
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,320
Oh, and also... please investigate
who this person named... Charlie is?

850
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,640
Hey... is this your doing?

851
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,560
I can give you even more than this.
