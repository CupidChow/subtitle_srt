1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,320
This is Janine, he will be your new manager.

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Manager?

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,520
We meet again.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,280
You are my artist.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
No matter what you desire,

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,240
I’ll always be here to take care of you
and support you in everything.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
#ArminFanclub

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,200
Please give me one more chance, Mr. Tada.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,240
Narin, let go.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,640
I apologize for interrupting.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,720
What I hate the most is being the third wheel,

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,320
but right now, I really hate that I’ve become
the third wheel in someone else’s relationship.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,640
Ever since I was born,
I’ve never been in a relationship.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
You’ve got it all wrong.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,319
What we had was strictly business.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,360
If there’s anything
you want me to change, I will.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
I’m truly sorry for everything.

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,400
You’ve got it all wrong.
What we had was strictly business.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,880
I’m truly sorry for everything.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,520
Narin approached me with a deal, everything between
him and me was business. But with you, it’s different.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
Here’s your work schedule for this month.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,760
I thought I wouldn’t get any more work.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,760
What made you think that?

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,920
Well, your boss said that...

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,160
That if he provided advantages to Narin.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,759
It’s because Narin did.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
Well, you know...

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,600
But since I didn’t agree
to that kind of offer,

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,480
I shouldn’t be provided with such benefits.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,960
Listen up.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
If he were going to cut ties with you,

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,320
I probably wouldn’t be sitting here, right?

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,840
Ohhhhh…

34
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,960
The truth is,

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,440
I’m not one to gossip about the boss.

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,200
The way he gives you everything...

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,120
Without you having to return any favors to him.

38
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,360
Don’t you think that means…

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,680
That you’re someone special?

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,360
Let’s just say...

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Honestly, from me to you.

42
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Well... I believe that...

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,520
Had Mr. Tada known he’d end up
getting close to you someday...

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,640
He probably wouldn’t have gotten involved with
someone else, just to avoid problems like this.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,440
But then again...

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,520
You can’t change the past,
that’s just how it is.

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,400
At the end of the day, it’s your call.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
If you…

49
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,280
Believe Mr. Tada or not

50
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,920
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
♫ Like a book already written ♫

52
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,760
The food is not to blame.

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,079
That mean you’re aware you did something wrong.

55
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,440
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,320
♫ The day I found you ♫

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,000
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,720
I don’t know how to make you understand.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
♫ I believe that ♫

60
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,640
♫ If that day we hadn’t met ♫

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,959
But if you don’t want to understand,

62
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,600
then just please don’t hate me that’s all I ask.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,320
♫ Even if the story were different ♫

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,200
♫ I think we'd still be the same ♫

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,680
♫ Nothing would change ♫

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,960
♫ Even if I turned back time
and start over countless times ♫

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
With food like this,
how could anyone stay mad?

68
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,040
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

69
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,560
♫ Every time I meet you ♫

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,200
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,480
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,040
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,320
♫ The moment I look into your eyes ♫

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,520
Tada.

75
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,280
♫ Believe me, I will love you the same ♫

76
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,240
What is it?

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
The food is not to blame.

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,080
I’m going to finish eating it all.

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,560
No, I’m calling to ask
if you can come out to meet me.

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
I’ll give you 30 minutes of my time.

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
That’s more than enough for me.

82
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
To be honest,

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
I have nothing to prove to you that...

84
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,160
You’re not just a hookup to me.

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,120
But my feelings go beyond that.

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
That's all that you wanted to say, right?

87
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
That's not all I want to say.

88
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,400
I just wanted to see you in person.

89
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:43,840
I understand you may
not trust me at the moment.

90
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,200
But given enough time...

91
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,960
I’ll prove myself to you.

92
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,480
All I’m asking is…

93
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Can you give me a little bit of your time?

94
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
In that case you’ll have to
give me some time first.

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
How long do you need?

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,280
As long as I need.

97
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,320
If you’re not willing to,
don’t expect me to make time for you.

98
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Take whatever time you need.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,400
Waiting is something I’m good at.

100
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
This is my good luck charm that guides me.

101
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,680
When I feel uneasy, it helps me.

102
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,200
People have noticed me in my new life
much faster than expected.

103
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
My life has become more
valuable, thanks to you..

104
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
Tada.

105
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
You have time for me now, right?

106
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,560
Come see me tomorrow
at the perfume photoshoot.

107
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,600
Bring your lucky charm necklace with you.

108
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,480
I'm able to find happiness with my new life.

109
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,240
Because of you.

110
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,720
Tada.

111
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,840
Armin, come in! Quick, quick!

112
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Today, we’ll be doing the photoshoot here,

113
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,240
and soon the crew and the director
will come to give a briefing.

114
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,720
Hello.

115
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,640
Excuse me.

116
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,040
Could you please get
the storyboard for Ren?

117
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,160
For BC Perfume,
we’ll be shooting three sets,

118
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,440
and also shooting with...

119
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,520
With that celebrity over there

120
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,200
Katie the rising model will be here too.

121
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,600
Super Fabulous!

122
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,120
So, today might be
a bit of a tough day at work.

123
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,760
But I’m not talking about Katie.

124
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,480
You probably know who I mean, right?

125
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,440
Alright, let me take a look at the storyboard, please.

126
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,080
This is set number 3 'Bloody Mary'.

127
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,560
The concept is BC Perfume will be
like a seductive cocktail drink.

128
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,720
In the scene, there will be blood
flowing down where Katie is standing.

129
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
- Katie, are you okay with that?
- Alright.

130
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
Ah, the props team, please.

131
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,640
Props team, let me just...

132
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
This whole scene is!!!

133
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,520
Bring the items over for them to hold and try out,
so they can get familiar with them.

134
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
- Who, this one?
- Yes.

135
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

136
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,560
Hey!!! Pass me the gun.

137
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,520
All of this will happen two years from now.

138
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,640
In my past life, I was just part of the crew.

139
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,440
- In my past life.
- In my past life, I was just part of the crew.

140
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,520
Here you go.

141
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,480
The gun without bullets.

142
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll give it one more clean
before the scene starts.

143
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,280
Hey...Kid!!!

144
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,280
Yes, Sir.

145
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
Get up here and help set the scene now!

146
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,640
Move fast!

147
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,720
Yes, sir.

148
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,640
Hey young man.

149
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
Can I get the prop gun, please?

150
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,320
Thank you.

151
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,240
You must be the model the client
added to the campaign, right?

152
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
It's just that I don’t really
have much time to watch TV.

153
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,880
So I don’t really know anything about you.

154
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,040
It’s a pleasure to be working with you.

155
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,040
How could you do this?

156
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,200
How could you do something like this?

157
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
I didn’t mean to.

158
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
How many years…

159
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
I love you.

160
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Listen to me first.

161
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,160
I love you…

162
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,920
Why would you do this to me?

163
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,240
Charlie, could you please come over here?

164
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,240
See you on set.

165
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
What am I even fighting for anymore?

166
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,320
Everything’s changed,

167
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,640
but here I am still having to face Charlie.

168
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,960
It feels like I’m running in circles
inside a maze full of traps, with no way out.

169
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
No matter which way I turn,
all I find are traps waiting for me.

170
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,600
Armin.

171
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
Are you okay?

172
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,560
Tada.

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,560
Since when did you follow me here?

174
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Just a moment ago.

175
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,160
Right when I saw you
talking with that photographer.

176
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
Is that Charlie?

177
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,440
That photographer there…

178
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,200
Is Charlie, right?

179
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Is it the same Charlie...

180
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,120
The one you used to talk about in your sleep?

181
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Turn off the light too, please.

182
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,160
Charlie.

183
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,840
Charlie?

184
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,480
Wenai.

185
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,200
Help find out.

186
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,520
Who this…Charlie person is?

187
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
You…

188
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,440
Still remember what you
told me back then, don’t you?

189
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,840
Anything you want.

190
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
I’ll be here to care for you and have your back.

191
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
Today.

192
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,760
I brought you….

193
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,480
My lucky necklace…

194
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,240
I’ve always made it through
everything on my own.

195
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,080
And this time is no different.

196
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,120
You can’t help me with this.

197
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,040
Armin... get ready for the first set, alright?

198
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
They’re probably discussing something important.

199
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,320
Excuse me for a moment.

200
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,880
Hair and makeup all ready, right?

201
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,440
- Yes.
- This wardrobe set for you Armin.

202
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,160
Okay.

203
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,160
The black outfit from the brand.

204
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,119
Isn’t it supposed to be mine only?

205
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,640
Uh... so, here’s the thing.

206
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
Ren’s look well, we thought
it might really please the fans.

207
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,280
So I figured the white outfit
from the new collection might suit better.

208
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,440
Here’s the thing...

209
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,720
If it’s a film, you can understand
that we have to act according to the script.

210
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
But this...

211
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,040
This is a commercial photoshoot, you know.

212
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,120
The most famous celebrity, of course.

213
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Is the one who gets to wear
the brand’s signature color.

214
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,680
Oh, and one more thing...

215
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,280
I’m guessing you all have been
in the industry for quite a long time, right?

216
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,880
You probably know way more about this than I do.

217
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
So then, the black suit.

218
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,520
Has to be for Ren only.

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,920
Come on Ren, let’s go
and change your wardrobe.

220
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,760
Excuse me, please move aside.

221
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
We’re going to change outfits.

222
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
This is a total mess.

223
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,480
What am I supposed to do
with these picky actors now?

224
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,840
You're okay, right?

225
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm good.

226
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,160
I can wear anything.

227
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,240
You sure?

228
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,000
If that’s the case, do you have any
standby outfits or anything else extra for us?

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,120
- I’ll hurry up and check it for you right away.
- Anything?

230
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,960
Quick quick! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

231
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,240
White...

232
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,440
Armin, you look really handsome in this outfit!

233
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,160
- White is Okay?
- I think this outfit suits you really well, Armin.

234
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, why is this kind of thing happening now?

235
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,920
Make sure everything’s handled carefully.

236
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,400
Alright, let’s give it a try first.

237
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,520
Give it a try.

238
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,920
Yes, just like this, but with a bit more deep emotion.

239
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Good.

240
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
Good.

241
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,920
But I want you to dive deeper into the emotion.

242
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
This angle, okay.

243
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,160
Come on.

244
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,920
Uh, Mr. Tada, should I have
the crew bring a chair for you to sit?

245
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,080
I’ll count on you to keep an eye on Armin, alright?

246
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,840
Yes, Sir.

247
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,000
- Mr. Tada...
- I’ll wait outside for a bit.

248
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,840
Won’t you come inside first?

249
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,880
But…Mr...?

250
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Really aren’t going in.

251
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh dear… what the heck is this?

252
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,320
No it’s not stress or anything like that.

253
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Do you understand
what I mean by emotional depth?

254
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,480
You're promoting the product just fine,
but please stay in character I envisioned!!!

255
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,840
Did you see the storyboard?!

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,800
Take Ren to rest first.

257
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Miss Muay.

258
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,800
You can take Ren for a break first.

259
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,640
Um…Ren.

260
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
You can go over there and take a break.

261
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
It's okay.

262
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,400
Charlie, Do you want Armin to shoot?

263
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
Ok, bring him on set then.

264
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
What a waste of time.

265
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Fighting!

266
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,080
Kiss me.

267
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,920
The essence of this perfume is all about killing softly.

268
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,960
You Know?

269
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,920
It needs to be seductive.

270
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,640
An obsession so deep, even a killer
can’t bring themselves to end you.

271
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,400
I want to see desire.

272
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
A killer's deepest desire lies within you.

273
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,320
A killer's deepest desire lies within you.

274
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,520
Before deep inside.

275
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,120
Okay?

276
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,160
Let’s do this.

277
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,080
Come on, let’s start shooting!!!

278
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,240
Okay.

279
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,480
I know you can do this. Come. Bring it!

280
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay.

281
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,680
You’re still the same.

282
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,440
Just like the first time we met.

283
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,680
Back then, I was just a crew member
secretly admiring your charm.

284
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,120
I fell in love with you.

285
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,400
But now I realize it was just a trap.

286
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,480
You stabbed me in the back.

287
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
You betrayed me.

288
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,600
You lied to me.

289
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
When did it all begin?

290
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
What made you want to get rid of me?

291
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
What made you want to poison me?

292
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,240
It was a plan, not an accident
like you wanted everyone else to believe.

293
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
Why?

294
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Why!!!

295
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,200
Why!!!

296
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
Why!!!

297
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,840
Why!!!

298
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,800
Stay there. Stay there.

299
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,480
Good.

300
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
Okay.

301
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,480
Hold it. Hold it.

302
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,840
Does he think he's shooting
a prime-time soap opera or something?

303
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,120
That kind of over-the-top acting
doesn’t belong here.

304
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,600
I don’t get it.

305
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,760
A high fragrance fashion brand.

306
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,360
Foreign brands this grand.

307
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,960
But the concept? Oh, it’s positively ancient.

308
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,240
Right you are.

309
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
His acting is like he’s possessed by something.

310
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
If you think this is a possessed ghost...

311
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Then I guess that’s just a lost, morbid soul, huh?

312
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,760
And here I was thinking today’s shoot was going to be
for some luxury high-fashion brand.

313
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
Instead, I ended up stuck with a ghost
straight out of a graveyard horror flick.

314
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,760
If I’d known I’d be dealing with
a bunch of loudmouths,

315
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,280
I would’ve come ready to throw down.

316
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,040
Those nosy loudmouth ghouls who do nothing
but trash-talk everyone else.

317
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
Janine…you!!!

318
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,040
- What?!
- Uh…excuse me.

319
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
Please go ahead and change into
the next outfit for the upcoming set.

320
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
The next set.

321
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,840
It's the Angel and Devil set.

322
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,040
Okay, You good here?

323
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

324
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,880
Just don’t act like a possessed ghoul, alright?

325
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Let's go son.

326
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,560
Oh...

327
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,400
It’s not so much the actor causing the issue.

328
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,960
The manager….

329
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,360
Is over the top.

330
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
Ugh… praising your own kid
until they’re completely spoiled.

331
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,960
If you can’t act well,
then don’t come around envying others.

332
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,120
You crazy.

333
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Oh...so how were you just now?

334
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,080
Everyone was quite startled.

335
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,720
But i just want to tell you.

336
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,480
You were fabulous.

337
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,200
It was so good.

338
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,280
Oops..

339
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,760
Well... I think Charlie.

340
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,920
He must really like you
more than anyone else, for sure!

341
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,960
I can tell.

342
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
Hmm…

343
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,680
If it’s really like what I think.

344
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,160
Everything must have changed by now.

345
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,480
I have to be able to change everything.

346
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,920
Uggh…

347
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,840
Change.

348
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,680
Change what?

349
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,320
Uh...You mean change your wardrobe, right?

350
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,440
So, you’re still… in the zone?

351
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,960
You mean you’re still deep
into the character, right?

352
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Fabulous, my boy!

353
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
Armin, let’s change outfits now!

354
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,760
Go change first.

355
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,040
Before those restless ghouls
come bother us again.

356
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,480
Hurry.

357
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
Great job.

358
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,240
Oh my god.

359
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,280
Let’s do the acting all cool and smooth this time!

360
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,560
Show them all how it’s done.

361
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,720
Hey, watch out!!!

362
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,080
Oh my god!!!!

363
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,120
Hey, Art team, why aren’t you being more careful?!

364
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,800
Hey, Art team,
why didn’t you clear the area properly?

365
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,440
And what if that got on Ren’s?

366
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,400
Who!!!?

367
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,720
Um…sorry about that Miss Muay.

368
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,840
Please, you and Ren come rest over here for a bit.

369
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,000
So sorry…

370
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,240
Hey! Why are you still holding the wings?
Put them down, now!

371
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,040
And be careful.

372
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
Can I please have a more competent crew?

373
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,560
We’re so sorry.

374
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,480
Hey, I thought of something fun and clever.

375
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
I want this kind of emotion, okay?

376
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,120
Just like this emotion.

377
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
Start giving me that emotion.

378
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,240
Okay.

379
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Beautiful.

380
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,360
The devilish allure that draws you
in with irresistible temptation.

381
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,400
Or can it ever rival an angel killed
and reborn seeking revenge?

382
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,640
The client really loves this idea.

383
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,520
Producer, producer!!!

384
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Yes.

385
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,720
Ren can go and take a break.

386
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,280
Okay.

387
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,040
Okay then.

388
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,480
Let's go Ren. Let’s come and take a break.

389
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,200
I'll take care of him myself.

390
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:18,960
Come on.

391
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,520
The light should hit right here.

392
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Sorry, I need to work first.

393
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,840
Hold on one moment.

394
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,320
Come on, let’s go up first.

395
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,120
But why?

396
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,520
What did I do wrong?

397
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,360
I'm actually the main character.

398
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,800
Where is the producer? Go get her.

399
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,360
Maybe he likes to act stiffly.

400
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Okay.

401
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,160
Okay, this mood, alright?

402
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,120
I love your eyes when you look at me.

403
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,640
Such bitter irony.

404
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
In the end.

405
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,160
I ended up facing the person who caused my death.

406
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,160
Bring the camera.

407
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,720
I want an angry emotion.

408
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,680
Something like...

409
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
I’ve killed you before.

410
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,120
Now look at me.

411
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,720
Okay.

412
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Okay!!!

413
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
Good.

414
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,160
Great.

415
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,600
So beautiful.

416
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Okay.

417
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,960
Don't come on the set.

418
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
I like this moment.

419
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,000
Hold it there.

420
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Hold it.

421
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,560
So beautiful!!!

422
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Come on, I really like this mood.

423
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,800
Okay!!!

424
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,440
Nice. Beautiful.

425
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
That’s right.

426
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,720
I once died because of someone I loved.

427
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,600
And this time…

428
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
If someone has to die again.

429
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,680
It’s not going to be me.

430
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,320
Good.

431
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,440
Okay!!!

432
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,640
Gorgeous... Okay!!!

433
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,040
If it put my person in danger, what would I do then?

434
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,360
How are you going to take responsibility? Tell me.

435
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Armin. I'm so sorry.

436
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
You go on home first. I’ll handle things here.

437
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,280
It's okay.

438
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,520
I'm really sorry.

439
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,320
It's okay.

440
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,440
I’m sorry. Are you alright?

441
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,280
How did this happen?

442
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,760
It's okay. Thank you anyway.

443
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,480
And who’s responsible?

444
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,880
Hey you!!!

445
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,440
I really liked our work in the shoot today.

446
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,960
I felt thrilled every time I...

447
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,640
The camera was focused on you.

448
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,720
I have to hurry to a small farewell party for a client.

449
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,560
If you're free someday in the future.

450
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I’d like to take your portrait.

451
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,800
And I hope you won’t say no.

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Charlie, could you please come over here?

453
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,880
Yes.

454
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,760
Armin.

455
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,520
You must be so tired from all day today.

456
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
I’ve made a reservation at a great restaurant.

457
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Shall we head out?

458
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Today, I just want to go back and rest.

459
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,840
There’s something I need to think about.

460
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,080
I’ll head back on my own, no worries.

461
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,680
Thanks so much, young man.

462
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
Hey, come visit Auntie, okay? Come often.

463
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,120
Drop by whenever you’re free.

464
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
Even if you’re busy, you can still drop by.

465
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,840
Look, in just a short time,
Auntie’s shop is already full of customers.

466
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
Phat’s been here since early morning.

467
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,960
Wow, sitting around just swatting mosquitoes all day long.

468
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,560
Hey, Armin.

469
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,280
You're here.

470
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,720
What kind of crazy mess is this?

471
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,640
Why do these two keep circling around my life endlessly?

472
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Min.

473
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,640
Armin.

474
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
Hey…

475
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
What’s wrong?

476
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,920
Sitting and spacing out, haha…

477
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Armin.

478
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,320
Hey…

479
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,680
They’re a fan club of the photographer
you went to shoot with.

480
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Hey, if you want to know anything, just ask him.

481
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay.

482
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,960
I wouldn’t know.

483
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,880
So you’re Just a fan, huh?

484
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,720
That's right.

485
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,320
Uh...

486
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,480
Mmm.

487
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,160
Phat, Go get some more food.

488
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,240
And also get some red syrup for Sam.

489
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
Look, it’s all melted already.

490
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,680
It's all watered down.

491
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
I'll bring you another new glass.

492
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,040
Auntie…

493
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,960
Where is it?

494
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,200
Oh…Come on Phat!!

495
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
It’s right there.

496
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,040
Is Charlie strict when working?

497
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,080
Actually, I really admire his photos.

498
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,320
I also went to see his solo photo exhibition.

499
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Only famous people get to be photographed by him.

500
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,680
As for me.

501
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
I’m super jealous of you.

502
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Armin.

503
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,040
If you get to meet Charlie again sometime.

504
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,120
If you happen to see him,
could you get his autograph for me?

505
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,400
Sometimes the right strategy.

506
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,680
Might not be running away.

507
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,480
But it’s about charging head-on.

508
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,440
Hello Charlie.

509
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,560
I’d like to arrange a meeting.

510
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,160
Sir, There's someone who would like to see you.

511
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
He has something to tell you.

512
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,880
The matter concerning Armin and Charlie.

513
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,440
Thank you very much.

514
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,320
For allowing me your time.

515
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,000
What do you want?

516
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,640
I have a proposal regarding...

517
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,680
So that I get.

518
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,000
And most importantly,

519
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,360
you will also get...

520
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,400
Regarding...

521
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,200
Armin.

522
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,520
I decline.

523
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,920
You really should  listen to me.

524
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,880
I know you want nothing more than to destroy Armin.

525
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
Therefore...

526
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,200
I would never do that.

527
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,160
You’re pretty amusing yourself.

528
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,280
Protecting someone who’s just going to...

529
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,040
Using you...

530
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,000
Just like they used
that photographer named, what was it...

531
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,680
Charlie.

532
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,280
What are you trying to say?

533
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,199
You probably don’t believe me, do you?

534
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,360
How about this, I think...

535
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,440
Even if you refuse to listen to my proposal, I still...

536
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,920
Be kind enough to...

537
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,400
There is something important for you.

538
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,120
With no strings attached.

539
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
You really ought to see it.

540
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm really happy that you came.

541
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,040
This is my studio where I create my work.

542
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,120
And shoot my own personal collections.

543
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,880
If i agree to have you shoot me,
I will get what I want?

544
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,720
This is my first time meeting.

545
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,640
Someone who is willing to share opportunities with others.

546
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,840
So easily such as yourself.

547
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,720
Come.

548
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
If you meet him, you will understand.

549
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,520
You must really like that kid, huh?

550
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,320
To do something like this.

551
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
I just want him to have what he desires quicker.

552
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,360
Letting two doomed things find each other more quickly.

553
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,920
How generous of you.

554
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,240
I am very lucky to have met you.

555
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,480
It’s my good fortune to have met you again.

556
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,080
To rewrite how our story began.

557
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,120
The question to which I know the reason best.

558
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,600
That you and Sam might have
conspired to drug and murder me.

559
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,000
I want to know what I did wrong,
what made you want to kill me?

560
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,400
I love the way you look at me.

561
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
I prepared something special for you.

562
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,920
Where are we doing the photoshoot?

563
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,400
Right here.

564
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
I’ve prepared everything already.

565
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,520
Take off your shirt.

566
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
Do you know?

567
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,800
In the future...

568
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,720
I will fall in love with you.

569
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,880
We will be lovers.

570
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,560
In secret.

571
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,160
For 20 years.

572
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,760
And one day you will stab me in the back.

573
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,320
Betray me.

574
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,160
And will ultimately kill me.

575
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,320
I like it when you take on the role of an actor like this.

576
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,040
You look so sexy.

577
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,360
But right now…
Let's talk about something else.

578
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,280
You know that I like…

579
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
You must like it too.

580
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,520
Armin!!!

581
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,760
Who let you in here, huh!

582
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,160
You bastard!!!

583
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,520
Mr. Tada!

584
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
What are you doing here?

585
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,560
What are you doing, Armin?

586
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,120
- Get the hell out of here.
- Charlie!!!

587
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,920
Huh!!!

588
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,840
Tada, Go!
Come out and talk with me.

589
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,600
Don't you ever mess with Armin again.

590
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,480
Come out and talk.

591
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,720
Mr. Tada!

592
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,760
Listen to me… come on.

593
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,320
Let’s go!

594
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,320
Get the hell out!

595
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,480
Pfft!!!

596
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,280
What the fuck is this?

597
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,200
Armin!

598
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,200
What the hell were you thinking doing that?

599
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,480
What are you doing?

600
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
Is there anything I can’t give you?

601
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,240
What made you think of doing that with him?

602
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,440
I’m the one who should be asking you!

603
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,160
The reason I agreed to come out is because
I didn’t want to argue with you in front of Charlie.

604
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,800
But you have no right to treat me like this!

605
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,640
I have no right, huh?

606
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,000
I have absolutely no right?

607
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,120
This isn’t about work!

608
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,240
The contract doesn’t say anywhere that I’m not allowed
to go take photos with other photographers.

609
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,240
For heaven’s sake, Armin!
I’m not just talking about work.

610
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,400
You’ve messed everything up.
Do you even realize that?

611
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,440
Do you remember what I told you?

612
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,160
That crazy time-travel story?

613
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,400
You can believe me now that it’s true!

614
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,360
And the fact that I traveled back in time!

615
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,360
Even though I should have died already, I still...

616
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,920
To take revenge on those who betrayed me!

617
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,800
I’ve been eagerly waiting for
this moment for a long time, but you...

618
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,520
You’re getting in my way.

619
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,840
You!

620
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,080
You’re just someone new in this new life,
someone I don’t even want.

621
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,600
Listen to me.

622
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,440
No matter you or whomever else.

623
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,280
You have no right to interfere with my choices!

624
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,800
I’ve died once before.
How many times I die again is my business.

625
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,160
Let me choose for myself!

626
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,040
What a shame.

627
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,360
In every life.

628
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,880
Your story...

629
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,400
I never existed in it, right?

630
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,160
Why are you pestering me now?

631
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I really should just watch you quietly from afar.

632
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,080
Yes.

633
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
You shouldn’t get involved in this.

634
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,280
Please, I’m begging you.

635
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,120
Don’t interfere with my business anymore.

636
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,080
I forgive both of you.

637
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,600
This is a gift.

638
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
What crazy nonsense are you trying to say?

639
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,720
Who are you?

640
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,280
Hello, Mr. Charlie.

641
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Armin told me if I wanted to meet you, to come here.

642
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,600
Is that so?

643
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,520
You are the kid Armin talked about, right?

644
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,360
Yes.

645
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,360
You’re hurt. May I help you dress the wound?

646
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,800
Or if you’re not available, I can come another day.

647
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,520
Sorry.

648
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,200
Come inside first.

649
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,920
You want to be a model, right?

650
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,760
Yes.

651
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,160
Do you want to be part of my collection?

652
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,680
Really?

653
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,920
I really like your eyes.

654
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,920
Mmm... Just right!

655
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,880
You really can’t judge someone from the outside.

656
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,800
You need to look on the inside like this.

657
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,920
Auntie… I’m just as handsome as him, really.

658
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,320
Hmm... you really dare to compare yourself to him.

659
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,120
Auntie, I'd like to order some food, please.

660
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,280
Sure thing.

661
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,080
What would you like?

662
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,520
Let’s go!

663
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,360
Oh wow…

664
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,280
Your kid friend is not so bad.

665
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,360
Someday he’s gonna be loud and bright as fireworks.

666
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,920
But you’re pretty generous to have helped him.

667
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,760
What you did for Sam and Charlie.

668
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,480
I wasn’t being generous with Sam.

669
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,320
I was generous to myself, rather.

670
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,760
Just know that the both of them
were meant for each other is all.

671
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,080
That's all you have to know.

672
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,600
If they were meant to be together.

673
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Then what about you?

674
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,640
Who are you meant to be with?

675
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,160
The Chairman?

676
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,320
I don’t talk to him anymore.

677
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,000
Huh?

678
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,960
Why?

679
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,640
I thought…

680
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,240
You said you were going to open the door to opportunity.

681
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,400
That door is gone now.

682
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
He doesn’t understand me.

683
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,760
Oh…

684
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,760
The young and upcoming celebrity.

685
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,400
If he doesn't understand you

686
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,520
And… Have you even tried to make
yourself understandable?

687
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,000
He just doesn’t understand.

688
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,680
What am i supposed to do?

689
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,480
♫ Do you believe in destiny? ♫

690
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,960
♫ Like a book already written ♫

691
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,040
But you were the one that said...

692
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,840
The Chairman made your life so much better.
♫ Two strangers once so far apart ♫

693
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,720
Think about it.
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

694
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,280
Is it worth it to try harder?
♫ Now standing here, heart to heart ♫

695
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,520
♫ The day I found you ♫

696
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,000
♫ Could not have been just a coincidence ♫

697
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,520
♫ It was fate that drew the line, making me love you ♫

698
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,720
♫ I believe that ♫

699
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,560
What your heart is feeling?

700
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,800
You think you are so sure?

701
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,120
You don't want him in you life anymore?

702
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,520
The gift you ordered me to buy has arrived.

703
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,120
Throw it out!

704
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,960
Armin doesn’t want anything from me anymore.

705
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,400
But…

706
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,400
Sir, you intended to give it to Armin.

707
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,840
Sometimes, the intention…

708
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Can also make someone feel uncomfortable, Wenai.

709
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I've decided.

710
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,240
I will step back and return to being…

711
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,040
Someone watching him from afar, just like before.

712
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,000
And…

713
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,440
The Business Trip you were planning…

714
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,800
Move it up to tonight.

715
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
Take care of these changes.

716
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
Oh, they’re coming.

717
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,480
- Hello.
- May I have a quick interview, please?

718
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,520
- Hello.
- Welcome.

719
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,480
May I have a quick interview, please?

720
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,040
The title ‘Deep Depths’ what is the story about?

721
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,840
Deep Depths, well… it features main characters who…

722
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,920
Everything is going exactly as I planned.

723
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,320
The main character…

724
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,000
- But I find no happiness.
- helps a homeless young man.

725
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,840
- Just because you’re not here.
- Who doesn’t have any possessions with him.

726
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,880
Tada…

727
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,480
But one day, he met Jira.

728
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,240
And what about you, Armin?

729
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,600
Uh…yes.

730
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,080
The character Jira is...

731
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,880
This camera, please.

732
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,480
Smile for this camera.

733
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,840
This camera.

734
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,840
Tada…

735
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,280
Hello, Armin.

736
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,480
I came alone.

737
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
Here’s something from Mr.Tada to give to you.

738
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,600
At first, Mr, Tada was going to give
it to you on the movie premiere day.

739
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,920
But Mr. Tada is no longer able to attend the event.

740
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,080
He told you to give it to me?

741
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,600
I took the liberty of bringing it to you myself.

742
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,280
Mr. Tada was going to leave it behind because he thought
you probably wouldn’t want to accept it anymore.

743
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,080
If he thinks that way…

744
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:34,960
You should take it back.

745
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,200
Please accept it, alright?

746
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,600
I believe you deserve to see how sincere Mr. Tada.

747
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,720
In past life.

748
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,400
Finally, your time has come, TD.

749
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,200
Who sent this, my dear?

750
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,920
My very first fanclub.

751
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,360
If it weren't for him, I probably
would have left the industry already.

752
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,680
Thank you, Mr. TD.

753
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,920
So it turns out you are...

754
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,680
TD.

755
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,880
The mysterious man and my very first fan.

756
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,400
The person I want to meet the most.

757
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,280
Tada, The one who’s been behind my success all along.

758
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,400
Mr. Tada.

759
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,320
Mr. Tada, where are you?

760
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,120
Mr. Tada, please answer me.

761
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,160
♫ Even if I turned back time and start over countless times ♫

762
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,160
♫ I'm still certain it would be you ♫

763
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,800
♫ Every time I meet you ♫

764
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,560
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

765
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,200
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

766
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,080
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

767
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,120
What’s going on?

768
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,440
Why did you have to come all the way here?

769
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,800
If something’s going on, you have to tell me.

770
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,800
I can help handle it.

771
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,800
I want to see him.

772
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,080
Wait, I’ll take care of it.

773
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
Is Mr. Tada in?

774
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,200
Just a moment, I’ll check for you right away.

775
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,000
Make it urgent, okay?

776
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,160
Mr. Wenai!!!

777
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,600
Let’s continue the conversation inside.

778
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,720
Mr. Tada is here, right?

779
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,520
Mr. Tada is not here.

780
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,040
So where did he go?

781
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,800
When will he be back?

782
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,640
And is it possible to make an appointment
to see him in advance?

783
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,160
Mr. Tada does not allow anyone to know
where he is or when he will return.

784
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,520
And also isn’t accepting any appointments with anyone.

785
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,200
But Wenai, we’re all part of his inner circle, you know.

786
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,880
You already know how things really stand,
don’t you? You know what’s what, huh?

787
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,640
Please, I’m begging you.

788
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,440
I really have something important to discuss with him... okay?

789
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:55,800
PHUKET.

790
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,240
Thank you for allowing me to come see you.

791
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,280
I just wanted to know why you wanted to see me.

792
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,760
I’m here to reclaim the lucky charm necklace.

793
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,720
You still want it?

794
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,840
You probably don’t need my lucky charm
to guide you anymore, do you?

795
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,440
If I didn’t want it.

796
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,440
Would I have come all this way here to see you?

797
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,640
Please let me have it.

798
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,760
I'm truly sorry for the way I acted toward you.

799
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,040
Despite the fact that you’ve always meant well
and cared for me for so long.

800
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,000
I never thought it would be you.

801
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,720
And I'm truly so happy that it is.

802
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,240
My very first fan club.

803
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,320
How did you know?

804
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,960
Did Wenai tell you?

805
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,200
Not Wenai.

806
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,360
It was this watch.

807
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,960
I once received it from TD...

808
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,440
In a past life.

809
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,320
I’ve been trying to find out who TD really is...

810
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:05,640
But everything that has happened in this lifetime
has made me realize that TD is you, Tada.

811
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,280
You are TD.

812
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,640
The one who has been sending me gifts
for the past twenty years.

813
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,320
Thank you for always being my support and encouragement.

814
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,640
If you want to thank your fan.

815
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,400
TD has received your message.

816
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,200
And he thanks you as well.

817
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,240
He will continue to be your fan just like this.

818
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,320
Because he can’t be anything more than that.

819
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,440
Tada.

820
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,640
May I sit with you?

821
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,400
You can drink this can of beer right away.

822
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,320
No need to save it.

823
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,560
If I had never aged.

824
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,880
I probably wouldn’t have known
what it feels like when an old person sulks.

825
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,680
Hey…

826
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,760
Are you calling me old?

827
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,600
I’m just explaining that an old guy.

828
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,840
Like me is seriously trying to make up
with the young chairman.

829
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,200
Being middle-aged like you isn't easy either, huh?

830
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,560
If there’s anything that makes you struggle.

831
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,320
I really don’t want you to have to do it.

832
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,560
Still got a full head of hair.

833
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,160
So why so easily hurt.

834
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,120
King of Crowns?

835
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,760
Thank you, TD — my very first fan.

836
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,240
If it weren’t for you.

837
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,920
I probably wouldn’t want to live anymore.

838
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,960
You are everything that I have.

839
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,240
Tada.

840
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,760
Knowing that you are TD.

841
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,880
Made me fall in love with TD — like a lover.

842
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,240
Even though I had never been in love before.

843
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,160
I don’t even know how to explain that feeling.

844
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:37,640
I’m sorry for what I said to you that day about.

845
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,760
My time travel.

846
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,360
It had nothing to do with you…

847
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,600
But when you disappeared.

848
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,480
My heart felt completely empty.

849
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,520
It made me realize that...

850
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,480
Coming back in time…

851
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,160
To revisit my past life…

852
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,040
In a way I had never seen before.

853
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,480
Never truly valued.

854
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,240
In every moment of life.

855
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:17,120
Whether my past life or this new one…

856
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,680
You’ve always been there.

857
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,240
Never once drifting away.

858
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,640
I still stand by what I said.

859
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,800
Whatever it is you need?

860
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,120
I will be the one to care for and support you myself.

861
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,400

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,760
♫ I'd fall in love with you just the same ♫

900
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,720
♫ Though the years may pull us far apart ♫

901
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,400
♫ Someday we'll meet, just like the start ♫

902
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,560
♫ The moment I look into your eyes ♫

903
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,760
♫ Believe me, I will love you the same ♫

904
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,720
3...2...1...

905
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,480
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

906
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,720
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

907
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,760
If you're happy and you know it,
then your face will surely show it.

908
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,880
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

909
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,280
You look at me like you're afraid I'll disappear.

910
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,520
I’m just afraid this is only a dream…

911
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,480
That I’ll soon have to wake up from.

912
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,680
But at least it’s a sweet dream.

913
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,360
There’s nothing for you to be afraid of.

914
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,720
So lucky… that it’s real.
