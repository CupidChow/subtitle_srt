1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,520
The security guard said
there's a package from Armin’s fan club.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,080
Thiwthit.

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,080
I had a feeling all along that
he wouldn’t just disappear without reason.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,280
Do as I ordered.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,320
All you need to do
is listen carefully to my orders.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
Your first movie is about to premiere.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
Everyone will see you the way I see you.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,760
Wow!!

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,400
You’re such a big spender.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,760
The crew should be on
standby up on the rooftop.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You might want to make a final check
before Mr. Armin arrives, Sir.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,560
So where’s the crew?

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,960
I want to go over the surprise plan
for Armin before he arrives.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,720
Sure thing, Sir. I’ll go check for you.

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
After the movie premiere is over,

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
I have something I want to ask you.

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,680
Let's meet up when you're finished with work, TD.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,479
I think I was the shyest, if you ask me. Yes.

19
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,840
Armin probably wasn’t shy, right?

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,479
Let's meet up when you're finished with work, TD.

21
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,440
- Hey.
- Here.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,240
Yeah, Here you are.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,520
Can you please turn on
the lights at event area?

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,240
Thank you.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes sir.

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
Who are you?

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,880
Step back.

28
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
Surprise!

29
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,760
Hey bro!

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm glad that you still remember me.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,440
The brother who never reveals his identity.

32
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Thiwthit.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
Don't hurt Mr.Tada let him go.

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,880
Hey!!

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
Who me?

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
I wouldn’t hurt my own brother.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,520
A lackey like you.

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
You're nothing to me.

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Hey.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Take care of him now.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,360
No!

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,240
Hurts, doesn’t it?

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,120
But this is nothing.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Nothing compared to
what you did to me and my mom.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
It was you and her who destroyed everything.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,720
You have no right to say a damn thing.

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,120
No!

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,200
If it had been me from the start,

49
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
things wouldn’t have turned out like this.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Let’s wait for that side character to show up.

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,240
I really want to know...

52
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,480
what makes him so special compared to me?

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
No Thiwthit.

54
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,120
No!

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,080
Let Armin go, this doesn’t involve him.

56
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Let Armin go.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,520
Shu!!

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,880
Shut up bro!

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,680
The power of the King of Crown
can’t control me anymore.

60
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Mr. Tada.

61
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Tada.

62
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,159
Tada.

63
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Where are you Tada?

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
Looking for your sweetheart?

65
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
Thiwthit.

66
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,160
Aww… don’t you guys feel sorry for the poor kid.

67
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
Bring out his beloved, now.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,480
Tada.

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Go.

70
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Are you alright?

71
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,120
Tada.

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Bet you never thought someone as powerful
as Tada of Crown Enterprise,

73
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,680
would end up like this?

74
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,560
Why would you do this?

75
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,320
It’s because he fell for someone like you!

76
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
Even if he never loved me

77
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,160
my brother never hurt me

78
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,440
not until he fell in love with you.

79
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,280
He loved you so blindly

80
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,600
he hurt my mom, hurt me

81
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,040
cornered me like an animal.

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,040
And the idiot never even realized that the whole time

83
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,000
he let me stay close,

84
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
I knew everything about him.

85
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,640
Armin is the one Mr. Tada has been quietly helping
from behind the scenes all along, sir.

86
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,600
Helping with what?

87
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,840
Since when?

88
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,080
Since he returned to Crown

89
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
he’s been helping with scholarships,

90
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,480
acting courses, and various gigs.

91
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
A childhood toy.

92
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,640
He will get bored of him soon.

93
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
Shit!

94
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,320
Damn.

95
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,960
Will you have me continue the investigation?

96
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,040
Enough!

97
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,120
I don’t want to see him anymore.

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Get out.

99
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,920
Why not me?

100
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,520
Tada.

101
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,560
Why?

102
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,360
I turned my love into vengeance.

103
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,240
Let Armin go Thiwthit. Let Armin go.

104
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,760
Damn.

105
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,800
Let him go? How could I?

106
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,120
I’ve been running

107
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,400
from creditors like crazy, barely surviving,

108
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,960
but I still had to come back.

109
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
Come back to celebrate

110
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
your success

111
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,600
which should’ve been mine.

112
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,480
My brother and I,

113
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
we really understood each other.

114
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,680
I want to kill every last one of you, damn it!

115
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,400
Shut down the building, surprise the lover.

116
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
Damn it.

117
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,320
Damn it.

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,360
If you don’t want me to call you stupid,
then what should I call you?

119
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Tada.

120
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't!

121
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,400
NO!

122
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,280
Don’t let go Armin.

123
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,960
Fate has always hinted at it

124
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,400
that what once happened will happen again

125
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,200
even my own death.

126
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,600
But at least, this time, my death isn’t pathetic.

127
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,240
But at least, this time, my death isn’t pathetic.

128
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,160
I die protecting my love…

129
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,080
and the one that I love, Tada.

130
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,040
- Let go! Let go!
- No Armin don't.

131
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
- Let go! Damn.
- No Armin don't.

132
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
Let go! Let go! Let go!

133
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
- Tada.
- Let go! I said let go!

134
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
- I love you.
- Let go! I said let go!

135
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,440
NO!

136
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,400
Officer! Officer, please help over here!

137
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,320
Weinai!

138
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
Someone’s hurt!

139
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,360
Call an ambulance, Janine!

140
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,680
You can’t go in, sir.

141
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,480
Please wait outside.

142
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,640
How's Armin?

143
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,720
The doctor has removed the blood clot
from around the brain lining,

144
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,760
but the patient is still unconscious.

145
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,920
We will need to monitor
and assess the condition closely.

146
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,200
If there are any changes,
I will inform you immediately.

147
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,160
- Past Life, 2025
- Lead actor award goes to...

148
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
Armin Thiwanon.

149
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
Armin!

150
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,000
We have an update on the autopsy of
famous actor Armin Thiwanon.

151
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
Traces of poison were found in his body.

152
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,520
Police investigations revealed that
a waiter at the party confessed,

153
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,920
Mr. Thiwthit Mekatsawakun had hired him
to serve champagne to Armin,

154
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,760
which led to Armin becoming
intoxicated and losing control.

155
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,240
Excuse me,
someone asked me to give this to you.

156
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
It’s for Mr. Armin.

157
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,480
For Armin.

158
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,119
Ohhh Armin!

159
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,000
All done! Let’s set up now.

160
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,000
Come on, we’re ready to shoot!

161
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
The power is in your hands now. Shoot! Shoot!

162
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,080
Don’t force me to do this.

163
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,440
Shoot!

164
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,000
Come here!

165
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
Grab him!

166
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,680
Armin.

167
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,840
What hurts more than losing you

168
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,920
is the guilt I feel,

169
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,800
because the conflicts
in my family caused your death.

170
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,560
Can you wake up, Armin?

171
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I know I’m asking for the impossible,

172
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,040
but if there’s a miracle

173
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,760
a chance to see you once more.

174
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
I will come to you.

175
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,840
I won’t just watch from afar anymore.

176
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,680
Please let me go back and fix

177
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,480
the story between you and me.

178
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,720
I will love you

179
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,440
and protect you... with my life.

180
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,400
I often dream of the lifetime in which I lost you.

181
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,160
That was the reason I decided to reveal...

182
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,880
- You!
- my true self to you that day.

183
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,200
I want to know why you went there.

184
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,160
It’s like… you knew you’d find him.

185
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,520
All I knew was that I had to rush there.

186
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,000
That’s all.

187
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
Armin.

188
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,080
- Tada.
- Let go! I said let go!

189
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,120
- I love you.
- Let go! I said let go!

190
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
No..No!

191
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,320
Armin.

192
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,440
Please...

193
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,080
Please come back to me.

194
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,160
Can you wake up?

195
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,000
Please give me one more chance…

196
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
will you, Armin.

197
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,000
Come back to me.

198
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,280
Please don’t leave me like this.

199
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm sorry.

200
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,400
Tada.

201
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,840
Nurse! Nurse!

202
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,200
Armin’s awake! Armin’s awake!

203
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,760
Would you like some water?

204
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
Are you okay?

205
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,040
Okay?

206
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,600
After you fell,

207
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,640
Thiwthit was arrested by the police.

208
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,440
He was the one behind all the attacks against you.

209
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,720
He hurt you...

210
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,120
just because he wanted to take revenge on me.

211
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,920
I shouldn’t have let him have the chance
to do all those terrible things.

212
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,600
It means...

213
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
everything is truly over now.

214
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,720
And everything in my future...

215
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,640
will really change.

216
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,040
Because those who hurt me have finally faced

217
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,600
the consequences of their actions.

218
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,320
From now on,

219
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,960
no one or nothing will harm you again.

220
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,560
I will be by your side.

221
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,080
I will be your present every single day, Armin.

222
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,640
#ArminFanclub

223
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,320
I’ve already had our outfits prepared.

224
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
You know…

225
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,240
if you wear a matching shirt like this,
everyone’s gonna find out.

226
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,240
That's fine.

227
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720
Then let the whole world know…

228
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
that you’re mine.

229
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Let me help you change.

230
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,360
Hey…

231
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,680
shouldn’t we be hurrying to the event?

232
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,320
I think…

233
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,000
we still have a bit of time.

234
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,760
They are here.

235
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,640
Awww.

236
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,480
This camera please.

237
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
This camera please.

238
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,040
Looking so handsome.

239
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,080
Over to this camera, please.

240
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,400
Looking so handsome.

241
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,560
Over to this camera, please.

242
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,520
This camera please.

243
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,720
Over to this camera, please.

244
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,680
Congratulations.

245
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
Most importantly, I want to thank the fans

246
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,600
- Most importantly, I want to thank the fans
- Armin.

247
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,800
and everyone here for opening your hearts to...

248
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,680
Excuse me.

249
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,040
So… will there be a part 2?

250
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,440
Well.

251
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,720
- What's going on?
- That's alright.

252
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,320
Let’s have a drink to celebrate our movie!

253
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,960
Cheers.

254
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,160
Come to think of it you’re pretty lucky.

255
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,000
You stepped in for Ren and landed a hit movie.

256
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,120
I also have to thank Ren for giving me
the chance to be in this movie.

257
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,000
Honestly, it’s a pity for Ren too

258
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,960
for choosing the wrong path.

259
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,240
If he had known the path
he chose would lead here

260
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,240
maybe he wouldn’t have chosen it.

261
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
But it’s no use talking now,

262
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,000
Ren already made his choice.

263
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,840
This is real life, not a game.

264
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
Where can we hit reset and start over.

265
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,880
Yes you can. Look at me.

266
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,800
Huh.

267
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm kidding.

268
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,120
Quick, drink!

269
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,880
Everyone is chasing the life they want

270
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,600
just like I did in my previous one.

271
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,400
Chasing money,

272
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,000
chasing dreams,

273
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,240
chasing love…

274
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,040
determined not to waste this life.

275
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,960
Because no one knows
if they’ll ever get a second chance.

276
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,400
Pharit and I we’re no longer rivals
like we were before.

277
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,800
We’ve become friends.

278
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,960
Sam found out Charlie was cheating
and chose to walk away.

279
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,080
It made me realize...

280
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,040
some people can change,

281
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,480
and some never will.

282
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,560
As for me, with this new life.

283
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,120
I want nothing else except him.

284
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,639
I know you like it.

285
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
Thank you.

286
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Just a moment please.

287
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,960
Give me a minute please.

288
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,680
What would you like to eat?

289
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,920
Wow, you’re serving it yourself.

290
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,640
Sorry to keep you waiting.

291
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,800
No worries at all! Thank you so much, thank you.

292
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,440
- Thankful.
- Let’s go. Let’s grab something to eat.

293
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,360
Wait, please  pick it up later, okay?

294
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,200
Yes.

295
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,600
That looks pretty tasty, Auntie!

296
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,280
Hey Min, you’re a star
you gotta keep your figure, man.

297
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Don’t I work out or what? Huh?

298
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,680
Hey Min, you’re gonna get fat soon.

299
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,760
Give it here, I’ll eat it myself.

300
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,120
Hey no!

301
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,240
- Hey.
- Min.

302
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,920
You two grown-ups already,
and still arguing.

303
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,040
Cut it out.

304
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,520
If we’re all grown up,

305
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
then who will you scold, Auntie? Haha!

306
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,360
You made me face-plant, Phat.

307
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,880
Phat, you really don’t know how to grow up.

308
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,720
Armin, as for you, you’re a famous actor now.

309
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,040
Go entertain the guests. Go on.

310
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,800
Come on, Auntie.

311
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,120
Who else would I care about
more than my family?

312
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,120
Wait a minute, Min.

313
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,880
What’s with the sweet talk?
What do you want?

314
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,160
Oh no, it’s not like that.

315
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,160
I just don’t want to miss out anymore.

316
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,240
Given a second chance…
I just want to hold on to it.

317
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,680
Hold on to what, huh?

318
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,240
You and Auntie.

319
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,480
You’re not a doctor, you’re an actor.

320
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,360
What exactly are you trying to “heal”?

321
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,760
Oh, you’re really the master of dramatic moments!

322
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,960
Oh, so you’re going to play that role now.

323
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,120
Doctor, could you please check this out?

324
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,840
The guests say all the food here
is delicious, Aunt Jeed.

325
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,920
Oh my, please give me a hand, Mr. Tada.

326
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
Hold me up.

327
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm about to float away! Haha.

328
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,000
I really have to thank you, Mr. Tada.

329
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,840
Without you, I probably wouldn't have
made it into the industry…

330
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,880
The entertainment industry?

331
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,520
Whoa, the culinary industry will do just fine.

332
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,880
What entertainment industry are you talking about?

333
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,760
Excuse me.

334
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,880
Excuse me.

335
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
Drink for you.

336
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,560
Well thank you.

337
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,000
I’m appreciate it.

338
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,960
Wow nice shirt.

339
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,960
Let's drink.

340
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, no problem. We’ll talk about it later.

341
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,560
Thank you.

342
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,680
Aw, so sweet.

343
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,400
He proposed to you, didn’t he?

344
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,720
Not yet.

345
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,560
Oh, what are you waiting for?

346
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,640
Hey, speak a little softer, will you.

347
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,800
Ever since that day... the day I proposed,

348
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,120
Tada was hurt, and so was I.

349
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,920
So I thought...

350
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,840
maybe it’s better if our love stays a secret.

351
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,240
Besides, it won’t affect our work that way.

352
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,720
So…

353
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,720
Do you think Mr.Tada will be okay with that?

354
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,560
He may understand.

355
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,560
What?

356
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,480
You acted like you didn’t care about the wedding.

357
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,040
How’s he supposed to understand?

358
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,800
There’s no way he will.

359
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,600
Yeah he may get it.

360
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,560
We’re together anyway,

361
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,160
so what’s the need for a ceremony.

362
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
This is enough to make me happy.

363
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,280
Hum...

364
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,760
That's odd.

365
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,880
I just don’t understand…

366
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,640
why Armin never talks about
the wedding anymore.

367
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,080
Even though he knows that day,
I planned a surprise for him.

368
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,200
Try to surprise him again?

369
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,320
I don’t want Armin to feel troubled anymore.

370
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,160
Since the incident with Thiwthit,

371
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,120
it seems like Armin doesn’t want anyone
to know about us anymore.

372
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,240
Would you like me to try investigating for you?

373
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
No, thanks.

374
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,560
I want the matter with Thiwthit to truly be settled first.

375
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,360
I don’t want it to affect Armin any further.

376
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
The news is out, sir.

377
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,480
Thiwthit, former executive of Venus,
sentenced to 20 years in prison for intentional homicide.

378
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,000
I hope prison will make him realize his mistakes.

379
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,360
Doctor, do you know?

380
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,280
that I’ve launched many famous stars

381
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,440
At Venus.

382
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,680
Have you heard of it?

383
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,960
I am managing director of that company.

384
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,600
And I’ll make Venus even bigger than Crown.

385
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,040
Crown.

386
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What have I done?

387
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,600
Some people want to change and repent,
but it might already be too late.

388
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,560
- I didn’t do it.
- It’s nothing. Really, it’s nothing.

389
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,240
As for me, I want to start a new life…

390
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,360
better than before.

391
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,600
What are you doing, Chef?

392
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,480
It’s a diet meal. Want to eat together?

393
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,400
I think...

394
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,520
I need to call the director of
your new movie soon.

395
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,320
Why do you have to lose weight?

396
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,680
it makes it hard for us to eat the same food.

397
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,800
Going to dinner together
becomes difficult, you know.

398
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,680
And you have to eating tasteless food like this.

399
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,760
Hey, why are you acting
like a kid and throwing a tantrum.

400
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,280
I have a diet meal that you might like.

401
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,920
Where is it?

402
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,960
Excuse me, I’m going to wash my hands.

403
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,840
Here.

404
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,800
Is it mine?

405
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,160
Since you wouldn’t eat the diet meal with me.

406
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,320
I ended up making
a fat kid’s meal for you instead.

407
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,240
Fat kid?

408
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,320
Umm.

409
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,120
Don’t forget, you’re younger than me.

410
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,240
Umm.

411
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,120
You’re starting to make me like
having an older boyfriend.

412
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,120
Yes.

413
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
Older boyfriend.

414
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,520
Yes.

415
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,320
Thank you.

416
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,000
You are most welcome.

417
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,040
Go to work now.

418
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,880
Mr.Tada here’s the summary
budget plan for Q4 this year.

419
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,120
And things related to technology advancement.

420
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,480
Uh, the total percentage would be...

421
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,200
It’s time to eat, my love.

422
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,640
There will be communication...

423
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,680
It’s noon already. I think you all should
take a break and have lunch.

424
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,200
Um, but there’s still...

425
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,280
Hey, do you want to take a lunch break
or maybe an extended break from work?

426
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,040
- Lunch.
- Lunch better.

427
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,960
Hello, housekeeper,

428
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,880
have you seen a lunch box?

429
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,960
A small gray lunchbox?

430
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,840
Order security to find this lunchbox.

431
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,920
Hello, Weinai, have you seen the lunchbox?

432
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,400
A small gray lunchbox?

433
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,600
Thank you so much Weinai.

434
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,960
Oh good Very good.

435
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,200
Can I get a OK sigh too?

436
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,920
Tada Okay.

437
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,480
The food looks really delicious.

438
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,920
Where did you order it from?

439
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,840
Armin did it.

440
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,440
Mr. Armin is really amazing.

441
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,040
not only good-looking,
but also a great cook!

442
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,240
- Want to try some.
- Can I?

443
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,640
Just kidding.

444
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,360
Armin cooked only for me.

445
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,760
If there’s nothing else,
may I excuse myself.

446
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,600
Go ahead.

447
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,640
Thank you Sir.

448
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,920
Weinai.

449
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,160
Yes sir.

450
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,560
There’s one more thing
I need your help with.

451
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,400
It’s definitely not something small for sure.

452
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,960
I still remember clearly

453
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,920
the first day we met.

454
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,880
If I hadn’t met you that day,

455
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,360
we might not be standing here together today.

456
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,040
Thank you.

457
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,480
I have to thank fate and a little miracle

458
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,840
for making me hungry that day.

459
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,680
Instant noodles saved my life.

460
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,560
That day, I went up there
in complete despair.

461
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,400
I had no one left.

462
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,600
But you…

463
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,560
you gave strength to someone who was falling,

464
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,880
and helped me stand again.

465
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:41,280
It’s because of you that I learned
the true value of staying alive.

466
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,000
You helped me realize the value of
having a second chance at life.

467
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,480
Back then, I was drowning in sorrow

468
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,760
trying to understand why someone I loved,

469
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,840
someone I trusted, would hurt me.

470
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,800
But then you the mysterious fan

471
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,000
hiding in the shadows.

472
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,680
You showed up and saved me.

473
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,160
You helped me reflect and choose a new path.

474
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,840
A path that led me to be with the one I love.

475
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,680
Everything you’ve done for me.

476
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,560
It’s brought me more happiness

477
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,840
than any success I’ve ever chased after.

478
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,240
Because I am your fan

479
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,440
and you...

480
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,120
are my artist.

481
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,640
Whatever you need.

482
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,960
I will take care of
and support you in everything.

483
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,120
#ArminFanClub

484
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,000
Come.

485
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,120
Hey, are you working as a guide
tracing the past or something.

486
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,960
Is that why you brought me here?

487
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,080
Surprise!

488
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,520
Wow, you really went all out like this, huh.

489
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,360
You went through
the trouble of cooking for me,

490
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,280
so I have to do something for you too.

491
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,480
But... what I did might seem
a little more special than what you did.

492
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,160
You really love to flex, huh?

493
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,640
Huh? This one? The king of showing off!

494
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,320
Easy, Babe.

495
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,560
You actually brought me to
the place where we first met.

496
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,680
Wow, the King of Crown.

497
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,600
I think you should expand your event business
to doing presentations too.

498
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,760
Mr. Tada truly ahead of your time.

499
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,280
Of course, my dear.

500
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,400
I can bring you even more than this,

501
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,600
because all the stars in the sky...

502
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,920
I...

503
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,760
can find them all for you.

504
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,440
With love... from my heart.

505
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,680
Please let me be your present

506
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,400
our every day, forever, Armin.

507
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,840
I consider this kiss my answer.

508
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,640
2025.

509
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:39,160
Time passed quickly, but the love
between me and Tada never faded.

510
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:45,600
We both did our best to nurture our love
and strengthen our relationship.

511
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:54,520
I can only hope that the chance
I’ve been given to reset and fix my past mistakes

512
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,080
will make it so that this life of mine
doesn’t end the same way as the last.

513
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,760
And I hope that in the days to come,

514
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,920
Tada and I will be together like this...

515
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,280
forever.

516
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,320
Good morning.

517
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,960
Mm, next month I’ll be going to
China to promote the movie.

518
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,360
Then let me come along too.

519
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,880
Sure!

520
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,520
So, shall we go on a trip together?

521
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,520
Sure! Where do you want to go?

522
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,240
I want to visit the filming locations of the series.

523
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,000
I just watched the latest one
and the views are amazing.

524
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,680
If you see it, you’ll be amazed.

525
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,800
Let me show you.

526
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,640
Here it is!

527
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,960
Shall we go?

528
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,960
I think it’s really interesting.

529
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,880
Sure, my dear.

530
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,080
Let’s consider this our honeymoon.

531
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,800
It’s our 100th honeymoon already.

532
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,720
So this will be...

533
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,360
the 101st.

534
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,280
You just keep leveling up
your bragging game with age, huh?

535
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,200
Have you ever heard the saying?

536
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,960
Ginger gets spicier as it ages, you know.

537
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,120
Yeah, getting older, sure.

538
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,720
But spicy?

539
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,680
That’s something we’ll have to find out.

540
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,320
Go ahead, have a taste.

541
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,320
Alright, that’s enough.

542
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,160
You have an important event today.

543
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,320
Hurry and get dressed.

544
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,600
The day I feared most has finally come.

545
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,000
It’s the day I died in my past life.

546
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,840
If this is the last day I get to live,

547
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,600
I will make sure to live it to the fullest.

548
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,080
- This camera please.
- Hello and welcome everyone to the Crown Awards 2025.

549
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:40,560
This stage is a prestigious one, dedicated to honoring the stars
who bring beauty and light up the sky.

550
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,040
And the Hall of Fame award this year goes to…

551
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,440
Mr. Armin Thiwanon.

552
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,240
I used to be a minor actor, playing small roles.

553
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,440
I couldn’t act well

554
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,680
had no work

555
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,600
and wanted to give up on acting many times.

556
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,560
I had a successful life,

557
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:53,240
but it felt empty... without love.

558
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,600
I died along with that life.

559
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,280
But fate gave me a miracle once again

560
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,320
to start anew,

561
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,680
and to meet someone.

562
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,880
That someone never gave up on me.

563
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,760
He was my very first fan,

564
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,640
my supporter, my guiding star,

565
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,040
leading me to meet...

566
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,000
many other guiding stars.

567
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,920
And those are all of you.

568
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,880
If it weren’t for him,
I wouldn’t be who I am today.

569
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,720
Meeting him was a wonderful blessing
I never expected to receive

570
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:54,960
and he showed me
a true love I had never known.

571
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,400
Thank you for changing my life,

572
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,600
Tada.

573
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,120
My very first fan.

574
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,280
and also...

575
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,720
the love of my life.

576
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,560
I love you...

577
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:30,760
Tada.
