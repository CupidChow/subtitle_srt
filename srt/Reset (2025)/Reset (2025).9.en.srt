1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,760
If you keep playing your dirty games like this,

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,560
you’ll end up with nothing in the end.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,480
If you’re that good, then stop me.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,520
Once it’s ready, we’ll set the scene, yeah

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
Please… don’t force me to do this.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
Shoot!!

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,440
Armin, Armin.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
- Armin.
- Are you okay?

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,400
I think I'm the one
who can take care of him best.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,120
Can you stop overbearing the nurse’s responsibilities.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,840
Does the patient want something else?

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
About that second wish you granted me.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,400
Do I still get to use it?

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,880
It’s valid for life.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,800
No limit.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Wait… you took care of this cactus.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Isn’t it cute?

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,160
It’s grown so much.

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,680
Thinking of getting a few more.

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,880
Just two are enough.

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,680
One to represent you,
and one for me.That’s perfect.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,920
No more new plant friends.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,640
Who knew Mr. Stone-Face,

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,759
could be this sweet.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,160
Don’t believe everything you see, okay?

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,320
You’ve got to test it for yourself.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,720
Now go get changed.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
I’m taking you out.

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,080
A delivery just arrived.

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
From who?

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,200
He said he is one of Armin’s fans.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,760
Thank you.

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,200
Let me see.

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,800
Pen.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Yes.

36
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,560
WOW!

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you like it?

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,600
I’ll get you one too…
But how about a hundred times better.

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,079
You know what they’d call you in the future?

41
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,880
A certified Show-Off.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,160
Just look at how hard
you’re trying to impress me.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,960
Then I guess you’ll have to call me...

44
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,680
Your Majesty the King of Show-offs.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,320
No one’s allowed to care for you more than I do.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,160
Not bad… kind of sweet actually.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
But it still can’t beat our little cactus.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,440
Enough with the flex, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Tada.

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,680
What's up?

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Pen.

52
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,840
Yes.

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Who sent this?

54
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,760
Umm I have no idea , he just left.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
What's up, Wenai?

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,560
Sir, you and Mr. Armin
should come back to Crown immediately.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,520
You will never live in peace.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,080
Congratulations on the success of King of Crown!

59
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,440
Security said a fan package arrived for Mr. Armin,

60
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,880
so I asked them to hold it here.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,440
But then I noticed there was blood
on the box. So I opened it.

62
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,480
You should see it for yourself.

63
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,760
Mr. Tada.

64
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,159
I reviewed the security camera.

65
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,480
And this is what I found.

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,440
Deliver this to Mr. Armin.

67
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Thiwthit.

68
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
I had a gut feeling…

69
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,240
he wouldn’t disappear that easily.

70
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,320
He’s bound to return someday.

71
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Yes, Sir.

72
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,440
Oh, thank you so much.

73
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,120
I hope next time you’ll consider our boy, Achi.

74
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,320
You saw how versatile he is, right?

75
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,200
He can take any role top or bottom,
he’s perfect for either.

76
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,080
Yes, Sir. Thank you again.

77
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,040
Goodbye.

78
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
- That's it?
- Yes.

79
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
Oh my god!

80
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Thiwthit.

81
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,280
What the hell are you doing here?

82
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,960
The police and the press
are looking for you, aren’t they?

83
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,919
Why the hell did you show up?

84
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,159
Did Ren come with you?

85
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
That selfish asshole?

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,880
He bolted with his damn mother.

87
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
I came here alone.

88
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,160
What the heck do you want?

89
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Money.

90
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
I don’t have any money.

91
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,960
It’s none of my business
to give you any money.

92
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
You really think you can betray me?

93
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,520
Don’t tell me what to do.

94
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
You have no power over me anymore.

95
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
And if I were you,

96
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,560
I’d leave now before I call the police.

97
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,920
Fine.

98
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,960
I’ll sell these damn photos to the black market

99
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,160
A talent manager running a brothel.

100
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,080
Turning her own kid into a prostitute.

101
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,160
How much do you think those pics are worth?

102
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,760
- Don’t you dare.
- Give it to me.

103
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
What the hell is wrong with you bitch.

104
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Achi.

105
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,000
You, get over here!

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
Help me!

107
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,520
So, what’s it gonna be.

108
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,840
I’m not just saying this
to get off, you know?

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,080
Help me!

110
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Help...

111
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,280
Is everything alright now?

112
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes sir everything is fine.

113
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
Hey… I know you’re worried.

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,320
But do you really need to
guard me in the bathroom too.

115
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,200
You travelled back in time.

116
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,160
Only to face all that cruelty from my family.

117
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
I’m truly sorry.

118
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,280
This isn’t your fault.

119
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,920
You don’t need to apologize.

120
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,040
Hey.

121
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,600
Do you remember that
TikTok video you made for me?

122
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,640
You said...

123
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,000
Whatever I need,

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,040
you’ll support me in everything.

125
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
Of course I remember.

126
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
But it should be only good things.

127
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,960
- Shouldn’t be like this...
- You are everything I need.

128
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I came back to love you.

129
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
To be by your side.

130
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,520
We’ll get through this together.

131
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Stop worrying.

132
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,960
Now...what can I do to help you feel better?

133
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,960
Just showering together,

134
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,160
Drying each other’s hair,

135
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,480
and sleep holding each other that’s enough.

136
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
Let me help bathe you.

137
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,280
Three…Two… Action!

138
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,280
You really are adorable,

139
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,800
Jira...my representative.

140
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
Cut!, Everyone prep for next set.

141
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
How are you? Does it hurt?

142
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,360
It's ok.

143
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,960
You were incredible.

144
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,640
I have to put so much of myself
on the line playing this role.

145
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,400
Not to mention the scene where I have to strip down
in front of you as a model for your drawing.

146
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,960
And all those other weird scenes.

147
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,320
But your performance gave me chills.

148
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,200
Hard to believe you used to be
just a background extra.

149
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,000
I had so much fun acting alongside you.

150
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,520
Thank you so much.

151
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,960
Actors, please go get changed.
We’ll shoot the next set right away.

152
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,200
Pharit, you’re up now.

153
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,920
Armin, you’re in the next scene, hang tight.

154
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,360
Bow, could you take Armin to rest for a bit.

155
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,920
Are you jealous?

156
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,640
You already know I am.

157
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,840
Our relationship can’t be public remember?

158
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,680
I know...

159
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,560
that’s why I chose to stay calm over here.

160
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,600
But I won’t let you be the only one trying.

161
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,360
What are you planning to do?

162
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,760
Excuse me, Mr. Armin,

163
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,320
a reporter would like to do
a short interview with you on set.

164
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,440
Alright, Thank you.

165
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,280
Did you call the reporter here?

166
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
Yes.

167
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,119
Can you tell us how the investigation
into your harassment case is progressing?

168
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,880
Well, it’s still under police
investigation at the moment.

169
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,960
On my side, I’ve become more
cautious with project selections

170
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,720
mainly for my safety and out of
respect for the legal process.

171
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,079
How do you feel about the situation
with Crown that’s been in the news lately?

172
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,160
I believe everyone knows
how much I’ve gone through to get here.

173
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,520
No one wanted what happened inside Crown.

174
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,600
We’re all trying our best to handle it

175
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,680
carefully and thoughtfully.

176
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
I still have faith in Crown I trust them.

177
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,800
Speaking of your debut film "Deep Depths", how are you feeling
about stepping into the movie industry for the first time?

178
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,480
I’m definitely excited. It’s my very first film.

179
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,520
And I just really hope everyone can see
how much effort we’ve all put into it.

180
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,440
It’s been said that you’ve had some wonderful
people supporting you, Armin.

181
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,520
We’re really curious where does
all that support come from?

182
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
This is my Northern Star necklace.

183
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,760
So, spill the tea who’s
the lucky owner of that necklace?

184
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
I can only say…

185
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
My love has the initials are TD.

186
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,280
Are they in the industry,
or someone special from outside?

187
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,480
Hope you don’t mind me
keeping the rest just for myself.

188
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
Aww, that’s too bad.

189
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,440
You won’t even give us a tiny hint?

190
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,400
Let's see next time.

191
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,880
You’re really keeping it a secret.

192
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,720
So, spill the tea who’s
the lucky owner of that necklace?

193
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,880
I can only say…

194
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,040
My love has the initials are TD.

195
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
- TD.
- Are they in the industry, or someone special from outside.

196
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,040
Tada.

197
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,840
Hope you don’t mind me
keeping the rest just for myself.

198
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,880
- TD.
- Aww, that’s too bad.

199
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,680
You won’t even give us a tiny hint?

200
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,080
Tada.

201
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,040
Let's see next time.

202
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,080
You...

203
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
Can you tell me one more time?

204
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
My love...

205
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,840
has the initials are TD.

206
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,000
Did you hear that?

207
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,960
TD.

208
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,400
Actually…

209
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,680
there’s something I want to do.

210
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,640
Say it.

211
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,360
I want to make my second wish.

212
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,480
Right here, in my place.

213
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,520
In our place.

214
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,320
My final wish.

215
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,440
From this second onward.

216
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
No matter what comes our way.

217
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,680
Let only death be the thing
that could ever separate us.

218
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
You’ll give me that, won’t you?

219
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
I’ve died once before.

220
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,640
But I never truly loved anyone.

221
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Through everything,
this is all I can give you,

222
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,080
my love.

223
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,680
Why the hell did you two come back?

224
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,920
What do you want?

225
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,560
I’m taking back everything
you stole from my family.

226
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,280
You pathetic little brat.

227
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
Silence!

228
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,360
I’ll have my revenge on you
even if it costs me my life.

229
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,800
I still remember all of a sudden,
you stepped into the role so confidently.

230
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
For that moment,

231
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,560
I forgot you were Armin.

232
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,480
First thing that I was able to reset
was my performance skills.

233
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,200
Bro!

234
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,440
No no, brother Just breathe… hang in there.

235
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,000
Don’t leave me.

236
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,360
Why are you doing this?

237
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Bro...

238
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,480
Bro...

239
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,840
Don’t leave me.

240
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,200
No no, brother Just breathe… hang in there.

241
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,040
Past Life.

242
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,880
Congratulations on your success.
I'll always support you, TD.

243
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,000
If I could ask to meet him just once,

244
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,480
so I could thank him,
Would that even be possible?

245
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,280
Are you really going in to meet Armin?

246
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,080
I thought… he wanted to see me?

247
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,320
I just want to congratulate him
in person just once.

248
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,480
One last time.

249
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,280
Oh!! Armin.

250
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,880
Armin!

251
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,280
What happened?

252
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,480
Armin!

253
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,600
Armin!

254
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,000
What terrified me the most

255
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,160
was the thought of losing you.

256
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,760
You’re saying that again.

257
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,360
If you’ve always seen me

258
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,400
then why was it only that
one time that you felt afraid.

259
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,840
Or was it nothing more than that.

260
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,280
My death...

261
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,880
wasn’t just another scene in your story, was it?

262
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,280
I just felt pain…

263
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,000
because I never told you
how much you truly meant to me.

264
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,040
Now that I finally have the chance.

265
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
I will never let you go.

266
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,360
You’re reciting lines in the car?

267
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,840
That’ll strain your eyes, you know?

268
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,760
Well… I still have to wear glasses, anyway.

269
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
When?

270
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,160
When will I ever look
into your eyes through those lenses?

271
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,880
I want to treasure this moment
for as long as I can.

272
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,840
Okay I wont read it anymore.

273
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,960
You know… I’m kinda excited too.

274
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,600
Today’s the wrap day
my first film as the lead actor.

275
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,720
There’ll be plenty more to come, you know.

276
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
So will you keep doing this for me?

277
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,160
Why?

278
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,520
Because you like it?

279
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,320
Well…

280
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,760
it’s just like any normal boyfriend would do.

281
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,160
Normally you’d have
a chauffeur driving you around.

282
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,720
We’re just like any normal couple, you know?

283
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,200
You know, if it weren’t for me,

284
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,440
you’d probably still be up there
in your ivory tower, like a crown prince.

285
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,560
How could this be? Driving yourself like this.

286
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,320
Because I have you, I get to try new things.

287
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,880
Waking up each day knowing
what I must do and who I do it for

288
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,920
that’s what gives my life real purpose.

289
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,720
Before you, I could only see
that life without you.

290
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,640
It felt like a dream

291
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,440
but a dream that seemed all too real.

292
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,320
Armin!

293
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,600
Now, I picture a future where I might lose you

294
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,120
and I realize how much I want to
cherish every moment with you.

295
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,040
Maybe I’ve been dwelling
on your past more than I should.

296
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,880
Seriously? It’s just a dream.

297
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,920
That’s why I want to be by your side every day,

298
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,080
as if tomorrow might be
the last time I get to hold you.

299
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,920
Enough with the drama.

300
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,280
No kissing scenes today, so no practice.

301
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,960
Focus on driving, okay?

302
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,640
Let’s go.

303
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,840
Alright, then let’s pick
this up again after wrap, okay?

304
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,960
If you walk out that door...

305
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,240
you’ll die.

306
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,560
Make your choice. Choose!

307
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,760
I told you choose.

308
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,080
The power’s in your hands now.

309
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,720
Don’t make me do this.

310
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,000
The power’s in your hands now. Shoot!

311
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,120
- Shoot!
- Please don’t force me to do this.

312
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,000
Shoot!

313
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,760
NO!

314
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,800
NO!

315
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,360
NO!

316
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,840
NO!

317
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,560
Cut!

318
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,920
That's wrap. Alright team, let’s call it a day.

319
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Absolutely fantastic.

320
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
Truly brilliant work.

321
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
Great, really great.

322
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,679
Great, really great.

323
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Excellent job.

324
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Great, really great.

325
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Excellent job.

326
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,679
Great, really great.

327
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Hold on, be careful it will dirty your shirt.

328
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,200
If it gets dirty… so what?

329
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,840
Alright, that’s a wrap Let’s get
a group photo everyone come together.

330
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,600
Come to the center.

331
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,520
Center, right, in the middle.

332
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,960
Let's take a picture.

333
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Come on, okay.

334
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,080
Ready, set, go!

335
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,000
Get close, get close.

336
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,640
One Two Go!

337
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,720
That’s a wrap on Deep Depths
produced by Crown Enterprise.

338
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,840
The premiere will take place very soon.

339
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,880
And rest assured the cast will be
out in full force for the event.

340
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,280
- Only one ?
- And rest assured the cast will be out in full force for the event.

341
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,720
And rest assured the cast will be
out in full force for the event.

342
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,600
I want you to deal with them both of them.

343
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Half up front as a deposit.

344
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,240
You pay the rest once the job’s done.

345
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,280
So, is this about business or an affair.

346
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,480
Your job is simple. Follow my orders.

347
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,720
Why do you even need to ask?

348
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Just listen to me and act.

349
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,000
I love you.

350
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,360
Armin.

351
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,760
What’s wrong?

352
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,600
Tada.

353
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,520
Are you okay?

354
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,320
I had a nightmare.

355
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,840
I dreamt that everything we’ve been through
together was just a dream.

356
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,000
It’s not just a dream, Armin.

357
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,400
I’m here, and I will never leave you.

358
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,480
Trust me.

359
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,600
I’ll make our story real.

360
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Everything okay?

361
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,640
Yes all set.

362
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,560
I can’t help but feel a little excited.

363
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,480
Your first feature film is about to premiere.

364
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,000
Everyone will see you the way I do.

365
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,920
This is my first success in this new life.

366
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,400
And you’re the gift you’ve given me.

367
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,440
Please change into your outfit
to prepare for the red carpet.

368
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,600
Janine.

369
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,760
Yes.

370
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Turn around.

371
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,000
Turn?

372
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,240
Like this.

373
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,480
Turn around? Why?

374
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,840
Oh! What are they doing?

375
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,080
Give them space.

376
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,640
Space?

377
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,320
Space.

378
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,240
Okay.

379
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,800
I want to see.

380
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
Excuse me, Janine.

381
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,400
Mr.Tada, Janine and I
will come back later, okay?

382
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,480
Take your time, no rush.

383
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,120
Wenai.

384
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,600
Take me.

385
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,280
How do I look?

386
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,680
You...

387
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,600
look stunning.

388
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
Tonight is your night.

389
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,120
Thank you.

390
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,520
After the movie premiere,

391
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,720
I have something I want to ask you.

392
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,520
So, let’s make a deal.

393
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,040
After the premiere of Deep Depths.

394
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,680
I also have something to ask you.

395
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,480
Let’s see who will answer who first.

396
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,000
Mr. Armin, it's time.

397
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,000
So see you later.

398
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,840
If everything that happened in the past
were to happen all over again.

399
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,960
Right now, I would be able to let go of all the pain.

400
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,840
And finally, I’m about to find
true happiness, isn’t that right?

401
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,800
- Smile for this camera please.
- Thank you.

402
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,600
This camera please.

403
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,960
Smile for this camera please Thank you.

404
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,000
This camera please.

405
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,040
This camera please.

406
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,680
This camera please.

407
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,040
Thank you.

408
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,160
I’m sorry.

409
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,920
But I can’t represent you any longer.

410
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,920
Please don’t force me to do this.

411
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,200
The power’s in your hands now. Shoot!

412
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,320
- Shoot!
- Please don’t force me to do this.

413
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,200
Shoot!

414
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,120
NO!

415
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,200
NO!

416
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,760
NO!

417
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,240
NO!

418
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,880
It's time.

419
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,920
Armin will do his interview first.

420
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Then I’ll take him to the place.

421
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,400
From that moment on…
my world will be entirely his.

422
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,720
The team’s probably already on the rooftop.

423
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:33,200
You’d better go do a final check
before Mr. Armin gets here.

424
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,240
This way please.

425
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,400
How do you feel after
the movie has premiered?

426
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,560
What’s the feedback like?
How are you feeling?

427
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,120
I’m really happy.

428
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,560
The press is waiting for you at the backdrop.

429
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,120
Hey Janine, did you see Tada?

430
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,560
Oh yeah I saw him
talking with the investors over there.

431
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,280
You should go to the interview first,
they’re waiting for you.

432
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,000
Wait wait!

433
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,760
Oops!

434
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,320
Seriously?

435
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,400
Oh my gosh, I’m blushing!

436
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,920
Wow!

437
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,680
You’re such a big spender.

438
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Okay, stop it. That’s enough.

439
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,640
Today is just full of good news I can’t handle this.

440
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,880
This is what they call love!

441
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,640
Awww L O V E.

442
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,760
I wanna scream, I’m so embarrassed in the best way

443
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,080
I just want to give him
the same love he’s always given me.

444
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,680
That’s all.

445
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,840
That's good.

446
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,680
In 20 years, they’ll call someone like you
a “BL fangirl,” you know that?

447
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,000
BL Girly?

448
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,960
Come on,T’m Cool, man!

449
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,560
Girly?

450
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,320
Okay, man go go!

451
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,840
Let’s go!

452
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,800
Mr. Armin, are you ready?
It's time for the interviews.

453
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,920
He's ready go go.

454
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,880
Thank you.

455
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,280
Mr. Armin is here.

456
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,480
He’s here.

457
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,080
- This way please.
- Excuse me.

458
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,680
Alright, let me interview both of you.

459
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,080
I’m very excited because everyone,
the whole crew, put a lot of effort into filming.

460
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,360
I hope that the audience takes something
meaningful away from it and enjoys the film.

461
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,800
Did you feel shy while acting?

462
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,680
I think I was the shyest, if you ask me. Yes.

463
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,040
Armin probably wasn’t shy, right?

464
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,960
Let's meet up when you're finished with work, TD.

465
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,160
Like I said, this role was challenging
for both me and Armin in this film.

466
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,320
This camera please.

467
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,960
Smile for this camera please.

468
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,360
I don’t wanna say this.

469
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,120
He asked you out on such a special day.

470
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
I’m telling you, something
surprise-ish is totally going down.

471
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,200
Is that right?

472
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,920
Ugh, I’m so excited.

473
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,720
Armin,

474
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,120
I’m really happy for you.

475
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,920
For everything.

476
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,920
You being in this exact spot
just like Mr. Tada said. Gave me chills.

477
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,840
He not only just said it.

478
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,600
But he kept helping
and always supported me.

479
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,920
Since the day that you came and started
managing me to make my life better.

480
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,720
Urrgh that was dramatic.

481
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,560
I’m proud.

482
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,280
You’ve proved everyone wrong.

483
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,960
Because I had you by my side,
supporting me all the time.

484
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,160
May today be a good day.

485
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,160
A very good one.

486
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,960
Okay.

487
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,440
Now go.

488
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,520
Don’t keep Mr. Tada waiting.

489
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,960
I’ll wrap things up with the cast
and catch up with you.

490
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,480
Hurry up and come.

491
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,600
Ugh, don't look at me.

492
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,240
Quick, Let’s go.

493
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,480
Don’t be slow now.

494
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,040
- Go.
- Yeah, I'm going now.

495
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,760
Hello.

496
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,160
Tada, Are you here?

497
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,400
Looking for your lover?

498
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,680
Thiwthit.

499
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,240
Go!

500
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,160
Are you okay?

501
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,760
Bet you never thought someone as powerful
as Mr. Tada of Crown Enterprises,

502
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,880
would end up like this.

503
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,440
No don't.

504
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,280
Don't let go Armin.

505
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
Let go!

506
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,960
- Let go!
- Tada I love you.

507
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,320
No.
