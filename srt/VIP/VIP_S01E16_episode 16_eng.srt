1
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,377
Sung Joon.

2
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,097
Let's call it quits.

3
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:47,597
Let's stop doing this.

4
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,557
Are you feeling okay overall?

5
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:03,537
Yes.

6
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:23,747
 

7
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:30,977
Yes.

8
00:01:31,827 --> 00:01:34,667
How's Ms. Na?

9
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,377
She's okay after being treated.

10
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:39,457
What a relief.

11
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:46,387
Did you sleep at the 
hospital last night?

12
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,867
Yes.

13
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,077
Are you going to work today?

14
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:57,657
I'll go in later in the afternoon.

15
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,127
See you at work then.

16
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,727
Okay.

17
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:36,117
 

18
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:39,267
 

19
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,447
Is it okay to start working already?

20
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,367
You haven't rested that much.

21
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:52,177
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

22
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:54,737
How was that your fault? It's okay.

23
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,357
I'm so glad that you didn't 
get injured badly.

24
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,557
Are you okay?

25
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,327
Why didn't you rest longer?

26
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,087
Is everything going okay?

27
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:06,217
It resolved quietly since the 
president gave out a gag order.

28
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:09,617
Geez, I'm so done with all this crap.

29
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,277
Yes, this is Na Jung Sun.

30
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,347
Yes, Ms. Ha.

31
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,277
How are you feeling?

32
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:21,177
I'm okay.

33
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,667
I'm glad it wasn't worse.

34
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:28,367
I won't forget how hard 
you work for this event.

35
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,977
I called you up because 
I wanted to tell you something.

36
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:43,267
I heard you know about 
Mr. Park and the VP as well.

37
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,707
With your support,

38
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:48,157
it would help us to 
form public opinion.

39
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,427
What do you think?

40
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,657
That's kind of...

41
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:55,127
what you wanted yourself, too.

42
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:57,777
I'm sorry, but

43
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:01,817
I won't get involved in matters
 concerning Director Park anymore.

44
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,047
Oh?

45
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,977
Did you already forgive him?

46
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:10,687
What a generous person you are.

47
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:14,947
I feel like revenge like this
 is meaningless now.

48
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:19,197
If so...

49
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,907
How about this?

50
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,747
What if...

51
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:27,977
I want you to be on my side?

52
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:32,327
You said you wanted to 
be on my side, right?

53
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,777
This would be your opportunity.

54
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:39,487
If you need the role 
similar to Director Park,

55
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,627
I won't be able to do that.

56
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:45,407
I'll do my best from 
where I am right now.

57
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:52,997
I understand what your position is.

58
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,657
I'll keep that in mind.

59
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:00,137
What a pity.

60
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:05,077
Scandals like this are 
more effective

61
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,997
when the wives expose them.

62
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,467
You look exhausted.

63
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:34,467
A lot has been going on.

64
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,257
Take care of yourself while working.

65
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,907
Okay.

66
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:07,247
 

67
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,477
 What a pity. 

68
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:19,167
 Scandals like this are
 more effective 

69
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,307
 when the wives expose them. 

70
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,737
Is she okay?

71
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:34,817
It's their fault, not hers.

72
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,457
I know, but...

73
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,397
 Here's the next story. 

74
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,637
 VP Ha Jae Woong of 
Sung Un Department Store 

75
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,327
 reportedly has more
 than 200,000 shares 

76
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,567
 under borrowed names according
 to an undisclosed source. 

77
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,027
 In order to take control 
of the company, Mr. Ha 

78
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:33,827
 has been purchasing stocks related
 to Sung Un Department Store 

79
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,517
 under the names of the
 executives including Mr. Park 

80
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:37,757
 and his mistress Ms. Lee 
over a long period timeâ€¦ 

81
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,567
She intentionally released this 
along with the adultery scandal.

82
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:47,127
So, you still can't reach Soo Jung?

83
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:48,127
No.

84
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,967
Ha Tae Young...

85
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,657
Mr. Park and Yoo Ri?

86
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,687
Why would Mr. Park and Yoo Ri...

87
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,317
How does that make any sense?

88
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,557
- Did you know about it?
- This is hard for Ms. Na.

89
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,667
Let's not treat it like a gossip.

90
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,957
Yes, that's true.

91
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:24,117
I guess you can't bring up 
quitting for a while then.

92
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:26,857
Considering the situation,

93
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,087
I'll bring it up when it passes a bit.

94
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,547
That's for the better.

95
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:42,057
Break up with Mr. Park.

96
00:08:43,097 --> 00:08:44,287
Father.

97
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,717
- Let me...
- That's why I warned you!

98
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,607
I told you not to see him 
until the paperwork finishes.

99
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:54,327
Choose Mr. Park if you want.

100
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,727
Instead,

101
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,207
you'll be leaving as 
On Yoo Ri, not Ha Yoo Ri.

102
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,597
 

103
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,037
That scandal...

104
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,417
I considered exposing
 it myself once.

105
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:04,187
I said to take it all the way 
because I was so angry.

106
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,417
Even if it meant it 
would destroy me.

107
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,217
I wanted to see the end.

108
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,377
But while I was

109
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:23,287
taking to the extreme, I realized...

110
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,337
that I didn't know...

111
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:32,267
about the things I needed to know.

112
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,717
Are you okay?

113
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:43,527
I thought to see him 
hitting rock bottom

114
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,617
would make me feel satisfied.

115
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:52,437
But that's not how matters
 of the heart work.

116
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:02,937
I don't even know who to blame

117
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:06,917
and who to get angry at anymore.

118
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,267
You can't just barge in like this!

119
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,777
I came here because
 I couldn't reach you.

120
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,397
I wanted to know what 
happened to your promise.

121
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,987
What did I promise you again?

122
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:40,957
If I expose the scandal,

123
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:43,747
you promised to get me a 
position at a branch abroad.

124
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,367
Oh, that?

125
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:50,187
As for that, you just said
that might be good.

126
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,937
I don't think I ever 
agreed to do that.

127
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:54,547
- You said you'd consider it.
- Yes.

128
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,117
- I said I'd consider.
- Ms. Ha!

129
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,517
Why are you yelling...

130
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,617
I don't think we have 
anything more to discuss.

131
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,367
Ms. Ha.

132
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,197
I'm at rock bottom anyway.

133
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:18,037
I'm not too thrilled about this.

134
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:35,487
Are you seriously threatening
 me right now?

135
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,437
Do you want to see 
the real rock bottom?

136
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,307
How violent.

137
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:04,877
Please send the end report
 as soon as possible.

138
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:05,807
Yes.

139
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,037
Yes.

140
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,837
Ms. Na, let's talk for a moment.

141
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,297
Are you feeling better?

142
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,097
Yes.

143
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,287
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,137
You're in a tough spot 
because of me.

145
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,547
When you did all those things,

146
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,427
were you ready to 
end up this way?

147
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,977
Was it really worth it for you?

148
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:10,157
 Was it really worth it for you? 

149
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:41,997
Are you okay?

150
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:48,567
There's no way you are.

151
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:57,977
I won't point the finger 
at you like everyone.

152
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:01,827
I wanted to do a good job.

153
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:06,037
I wanted to reach the top.

154
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:09,257
For someone who had nothing,

155
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:13,387
that was the only thing
 I could get by trying.

156
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,677
I think I wanted to prove something

157
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,317
to Jung Sun

158
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,647
and people.

159
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,787
I had to make a decision

160
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,907
at some point in the process.

161
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:38,287
What I thought would 
be acceptable

162
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:43,047
was actually very far away
 from what's acceptable.

163
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,607
When I came to my senses,

164
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:52,497
I was so far gone that
 there's no turning back.

165
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,067
But this is for the better.

166
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,167
I can at least stop now.

167
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,827
 

168
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:02,157
 Could you teach me 
how to drive tomorrow? 

169
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:44,727
 Hello? 

170
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,817
This is Jung Sun.

171
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:50,837
Using your right foot,

172
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,877
press the accelerator slowly.

173
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,667
- My goodness!
- Stop, stop, stop.

174
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,277
I'm scared.

175
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,867
It's okay.

176
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,907
Do it slowly.

177
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:07,187
Try pressing it again slowly.

178
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,077
That's it.

179
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:10,597
That's it.

180
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,667
- We're moving.
- Yes.

181
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,527
Okay, now...

182
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:16,687
try rotating the handle 
to the left slowly.

183
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,467
To the left.

184
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,867
Okay.

185
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,267
Since we stopped now, 
try rotating the handle.

186
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:26,987
A little more. A little more.

187
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:28,657
Okay, that's good.

188
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:31,177
Now try pressing the 
accelerator slowly again.

189
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,067
That's it.

190
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,887
You're good.

191
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:42,317
I'm driving right now!

192
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:55,617
This place has

193
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:58,637
clear air and lovely scenery.

194
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:01,527
You don't interact 
with people a lot,

195
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:04,867
but that can be pretty 
stressful, too.

196
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,127
What brings you to 
Yeoncheon anyway?

197
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:13,017
I'm on vacation.

198
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,717
I wanted to clear my head, too.

199
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,137
How did you know 
that I was here?

200
00:20:17,987 --> 00:20:20,087
I heard from Dad.

201
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:28,607
I heard about Sung Joon.

202
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:34,467
I was so fired up inside when
 I heard about that.

203
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,757
They say you can't trust 
anyone in the world,

204
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,007
but I still trusted him.

205
00:20:40,997 --> 00:20:43,397
I should teach him a thing or two...

206
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:47,667
I'm sure...

207
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,867
he'll regret it.

208
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,067
I regret it, too.

209
00:20:57,947 --> 00:21:00,237
I'm sure he'll regret it.

210
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,367
Are you in good health?

211
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,007
I'm okay.

212
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,737
I told you.

213
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:16,457
People like me don't die easily.

214
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:24,187
Hold on a second.

215
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,567
- Spend this on your trip.
- It's okay.

216
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:35,757
That's all I can give you.

217
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,657
Thanks so much.

218
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,867
Thank you for calling me up first.

219
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:49,667
I'm ashamed to say this, but

220
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,857
seeing you like this 
makes me happy.

221
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,507
It's just...

222
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:58,467
hard for me to keep hating you.

223
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:05,227
I'll get going.

224
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,907
Once I learn how to drive,

225
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,987
I wanted to drive myself

226
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:47,417
to go to the movie theaters

227
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:51,477
and travel somewhere, too.

228
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,107
There's a tent bar.

229
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:02,107
Let's get a drink there.

230
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:15,377
I had a great time today.

231
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:19,137
I learned how to drive

232
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,687
and we got to come to 
a tent bar together again.

233
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:26,107
I don't think I could 
ever forget this day.

234
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,767
What did you think, Sung Joon?

235
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,277
I had a good time, too.

236
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:38,747
You're lying.

237
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:42,207
You know what?

238
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,527
You always look sad

239
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,747
whenever you're with me.

240
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:53,147
I thought things would get better

241
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:56,187
if we spend more time together,

242
00:23:57,257 --> 00:24:00,017
but I think your sadness
 is getting deeper.

243
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:05,347
I didn't understand why,

244
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:09,047
but I think I do now.

245
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:17,887
I'm that kind of person to you.

246
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:23,027
Someone...

247
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,447
who reminds you of sad things.

248
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,967
The one who reminds you that

249
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:38,017
you broke up with Ms. Na.

250
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,387
Yoo Ri.

251
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:48,697
I didn't think I'd be lonely
 if I'm with you,

252
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:54,367
but I feel lonelier being
 next to you now.

253
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,937
That's why I...

254
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:10,127
decided to...

255
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:12,017
break up with you.

256
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:16,967
It's because of the scandal, too.

257
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:21,187
I can no longer see you 
while being criticized.

258
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:25,087
I finally managed to find 
my footing at work,

259
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:28,587
but I don't want to ruin 
everything because of you.

260
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:32,597
Let's break up.

261
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,857
I'm...

262
00:25:37,557 --> 00:25:39,327
leaving you.

263
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,437
I'm sorry.

264
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,367
I said I'm the one dumping you.

265
00:25:55,817 --> 00:25:57,197
I'm sorry.

266
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:58,817
There will be an announcement in 
the media that you'll step down

267
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,577
from your position, Jae Woong.

268
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,777
Take a break and travel
 abroad for a while.

269
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:07,657
Tae Young will take 
care of the company.

270
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,137
You'd better be careful, too.

271
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:14,347
Don't bring in people like Mr. Bae
 just because he flatters you.

272
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:17,477
It's a leader's job to be 
selective with people, too.

273
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:18,687
Yes, Father.

274
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:22,597
I'll take care of the 
scandal myself.

275
00:27:22,597 --> 00:27:24,347
Don't worry too much, Father.

276
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,037
Yes, you're right.

277
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,567
 

278
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:50,117
I thought I was almost there.

279
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,397
I'll reassign you to an 
appropriate position soon.

280
00:27:57,397 --> 00:27:58,867
So leave the country for a while.

281
00:27:58,867 --> 00:28:02,467
Let's consider this as a break 
before we start running again.

282
00:28:03,607 --> 00:28:06,077
I've respected you all along.

283
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:11,177
You gave me projects 
because you trusted me.

284
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:13,657
And I wanted to excel in them.

285
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,867
Maybe that's why

286
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:19,867
even when I was supposed to pause
and tell you the right thing,

287
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,667
I couldn't do that.

288
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:28,847
But I think I should stop now.

289
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:35,087
You gave me the opportunity, 
and I made all the decisions.

290
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,397
So I'll take responsibility

291
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:40,687
for the consequences as well.

292
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:43,847
Thank you so much

293
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:47,567
for trusting me all these years.

294
00:29:25,337 --> 00:29:27,027
 

295
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,557
 I packed up all your things. 

296
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:51,237
The superstar Song Mi Na 
ran a little late.

297
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:53,047
Please hurry up and have a seat.

298
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:54,437
I'd like to thank everyone

299
00:29:54,437 --> 00:29:58,547
for attending the award ceremony.

300
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,297
Here's the highlight of the night.

301
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:04,347
I'll announce the winner of the 
Employee of the Year award.

302
00:30:04,347 --> 00:30:07,317
I'm very curious myself, too.

303
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:09,507
Okay...

304
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,767
It was her.

305
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:23,767
The winner of the 
Employee of the Year is...

306
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:31,267
Song Mi Na! A round of applause!

307
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:35,487
How wonderful!

308
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:38,037
Okay.

309
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,797
The Employee of the Year 
award goes to Song Mi Na.

310
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,567
Ever since Song Mi Na started
 working at Sung Un,

311
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:46,957
she's been working as a working mom 
of two children for six years.

312
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:49,067
She has stepped up
 to the challenge

313
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,337
and is a model employee.

314
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:55,007
Therefore, we present her with
this certificate and reward.

315
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:56,907
A round of applause!

316
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,647
Please give her the bouquet.

317
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:05,007
Please give her the reward, too.

318
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:09,507
The flowers look very 
expensive and pretty.

319
00:31:16,437 --> 00:31:18,237
Yes, thank you.

320
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:23,077
Honey, thanks for 
all the hard work.

321
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:26,997
When did you prepare all this?

322
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:28,497
It's nothing.

323
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,947
By the way...

324
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:34,747
could you work a little longer?

325
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:38,767
I requested parental leave.

326
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:41,447
- What?
- So you can't quit right now.

327
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:43,047
I know you...

328
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,297
still want to work.

329
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:47,167
I'm sure you'll regret

330
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,977
if you quit now.

331
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:52,267
You can quit later on 
but now isn't the time.

332
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,697
But...

333
00:31:54,697 --> 00:31:57,707
You've always done this. 
Let me do it this time.

334
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:01,287
Will you be okay?

335
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,767
I requested leave to raise my own 
kids. What could they do?

336
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:07,297
Although my team 
leader will hate me.

337
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,117
Anyway, I already told them.

338
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,457
I can't take it back now.

339
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:12,437
Since I became a better parent,

340
00:32:12,437 --> 00:32:14,437
I'll do my best to support you.

341
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:16,607
So don't worry and focus on work.

342
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:20,517
Thank you.

343
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:22,717
Aigoo, I didn't do it 
for this reaction.

344
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:24,897
Make a lot of money for us.

345
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,167
By the way, I need to 
tell you something.

346
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,167
Huh?

347
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,227
It's a boy.

348
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:39,387
Good luck.

349
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:40,857
Good luck.

350
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,947
Aigoo, that's great!

351
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:47,417
So that's how it is...

352
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,767
That's a good thing, right?

353
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,257
Don't laugh.

354
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:04,267
I've known Sung Joon oppa a long 
time since my younger days.

355
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:07,187
That's why I thought 
I knew him well.

356
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:12,067
Honestly, I'm shocked.

357
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,707
I'm sure Jung Sun feels worse.

358
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,337
I've always thought it's 
better to hide stuff

359
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:24,237
you don't want to reveal,

360
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,567
but that ends up...

361
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,937
hurting everyone.

362
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:35,937
Keeping secrets often 
leads to a bad ending.

363
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:42,407
I hope you don't hide 
anything from me.

364
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:44,197
You can be honest with me.

365
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:51,047
Do you have the guts to 
be completely honest?

366
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:57,507
I actually weighed over 
100 kg until I was in college.

367
00:33:57,507 --> 00:34:01,017
This is the result 
of a cut-throat diet.

368
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,867
Now it's your turn. Tell me.

369
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:08,887
- Are you sure you won't be shocked?
- Yes.

370
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,277
So did I.

371
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:15,797
Really?

372
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:19,867
No way!

373
00:34:48,107 --> 00:34:49,327
Thank you.

374
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,577
It's a divorce paper.

375
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:07,317
I filled out my portion.

376
00:35:15,587 --> 00:35:17,787
Mother told me...

377
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,697
about your father.

378
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,637
I thought I knew you well,

379
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,227
but I guess I didn't.

380
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,967
I...

381
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:43,057
had a dream as a kid.

382
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,757
I wanted to have
 a loving marriage

383
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:49,927
and a child we love.

384
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:57,097
I dreamed of creating a family
 where no one feels lonely.

385
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:00,907
The first time we met,

386
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:03,647
you told me that

387
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:09,577
you could imagine your
 future growing old with me.

388
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:12,407
I felt that way, too.

389
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:18,077
I felt like I could create 
a family like that with you.

390
00:36:18,077 --> 00:36:21,357
Maybe that's why I liked you a lot.

391
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,207
But maybe...

392
00:36:28,747 --> 00:36:32,177
I only saw the side of 
you I wanted to see.

393
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,607
Did I really...

394
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,177
Did we really...

395
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:48,317
understand each other?

396
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:55,557
You did your best.

397
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:57,717
But I didn't.

398
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,767
You should've told me.

399
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:06,267
You should've given me
 the chance to understand.

400
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,867
You probably would've 
tried to understand.

401
00:37:12,617 --> 00:37:15,437
I'm sure you would've tried to
 defend me no matter what.

402
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,077
But I couldn't do that.

403
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:26,187
I know what you went
 through with your mother.

404
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:29,177
But I...

405
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:33,177
couldn't bring myself

406
00:37:34,407 --> 00:37:36,787
to tell you that we're
 the kinds of people

407
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:42,377
who hurt others like that.

408
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,687
If I were...

409
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,617
honest with you about my family...

410
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:56,977
If I discussed it with
 you when the VP

411
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,317
suggested those things to me,

412
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:04,217
everything would be different now.

413
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:07,987
That's what I regret.

414
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:12,957
Although there's no turning back.

415
00:38:20,337 --> 00:38:23,137
For the past ten years,

416
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:28,007
you were the most 
important person to me.

417
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:33,597
That's why I couldn't forgive you.

418
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:38,667
I really hated you.

419
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:44,377
But when Mother told me that,

420
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:48,027
I stupidly felt heartbroken.

421
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:54,177
Maybe we went through
 too much together

422
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:57,967
to feel nothing but hatred.

423
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:05,167
Let's call it quits.

424
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,067
I think that's the right thing to do.

425
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,037
Jung Sun.

426
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:25,097
I want you to be well.

427
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:28,747
I mean it.

428
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:34,387
Goodbye.

429
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:34,037
My father also says...

430
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:37,087
he doesn't need you 
when you're no longer

431
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:38,947
the VP of Sung Un.

432
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:40,737
He approved...

433
00:41:42,637 --> 00:41:44,247
our divorce.

434
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:47,127
Myung Eun.

435
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:50,547
The decision to divorce you or not

436
00:41:50,547 --> 00:41:52,947
is up to me now.

437
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:55,987
Myung Eun, please...

438
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:58,647
You're all I have now.

439
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:02,567
Finally, in the end...

440
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:06,067
you only have me.

441
00:42:12,927 --> 00:42:15,087
I'll be watching you.

442
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:17,217
To see how you behave.

443
00:42:18,277 --> 00:42:20,627
You should do it right 
this time around.

444
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,717
 

445
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:38,137
Wow, all the VP's people 
have been fired.

446
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:40,367
They got rid of the 
Prestige Team, too.

447
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,947
The president sure is
 switching up the game all right.

448
00:42:42,947 --> 00:42:44,217
I know.

449
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:46,317
No matter how hard we work,

450
00:42:46,317 --> 00:42:49,677
we're just higher-ups' 
pawns on their chessboard.

451
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:52,337
Gosh, I wonder if 
Jung Sun will be okay.

452
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,047
I'm going to the VIP Lounge.

453
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:16,217
It looks like the situation
 has been settled.

454
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:19,517
So, how do you like it?

455
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:26,017
Whether you like it or not,

456
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:27,557
it's all over.

457
00:43:27,557 --> 00:43:29,647
So, you should have 
a new beginning.

458
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,637
For you and me.

459
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:33,777
Yes.

460
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,177
I should.

461
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,287
But I need people like 
Mr. Park right now.

462
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,807
I know.

463
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:46,837
You're definitely not the type.

464
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,457
For the company as 
well as for me,

465
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:54,057
we need competent people.

466
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,417
As you've said,

467
00:43:56,417 --> 00:44:01,047
please do the best you can
 in your current position.

468
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:02,457
Okay.

469
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,957
Mr. Na, the previous 
meeting is running long,

470
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:21,537
so our meeting will be postponed
 for about 30 minutes.

471
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,647
Okay. Got it.

472
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:30,497
You'll be fine.

473
00:44:31,597 --> 00:44:35,137
You're a strong person, 
so all these things will pass

474
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,817
and you'll be fine.

475
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:40,677
Thanks, Sang Woo.

476
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,857
I wish for you to smile 
again, Ms. Na.

477
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:47,077
I have...

478
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,367
respect for you, Ms. Na.

479
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,677
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

480
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:42,947
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

481
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:44,197
- This one, too? 
 - Yeah.

482
00:47:44,857 --> 00:47:46,857
Thank you.

483
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:48,237
Sir.

484
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:49,777
The rest are expensive,

485
00:47:49,777 --> 00:47:51,337
- so be gentle with them. 
 - Yes.

486
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,387
Are we almost done now?

487
00:48:13,387 --> 00:48:15,507
We're done.

488
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:18,007
Good job.

489
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,547
Good job...

490
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:24,707
You did well.

491
00:48:24,707 --> 00:48:27,837
How about black bean 
noodles and beer?

492
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:29,677
I have to see Mi Na.

493
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:31,207
No, you can't go.

494
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,757
Let's make rice.

495
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:34,247
- Coming back early? 
 - Yup.

496
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:39,467
Our night is long now...

497
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:52,467
Ta-da!

498
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:54,907
What's this?

499
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:56,697
Move-in gift.

500
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,417
Put it on for me.

501
00:49:17,137 --> 00:49:18,337
Done.

502
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:20,307
How do I look?

503
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:24,357
Pretty.

504
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:33,397
It's pretty.

505
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:35,777
Thank you.

506
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:46,617
She's showing us.

507
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:49,187
So cute!

508
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,587
So cute...

509
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,517
- So cute...
 - So cute...

510
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:54,027
So cute.

511
00:49:55,087 --> 00:49:57,207
- So cute. 
 - Cute.

512
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:00,407
Here we are.

513
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:02,487
Young Joon and 
Seo Joon are here.

514
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:03,607
Aigoo, aigoo...

515
00:50:03,607 --> 00:50:05,567
- We saw our new brother. 
 - Oh, good. Come.

516
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,497
- You came. 
 - You guys...

517
00:50:07,497 --> 00:50:09,377
I washed, dressed, and fed you.

518
00:50:09,377 --> 00:50:10,947
But you still love mommy, huh?

519
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:12,167
Fine.

520
00:50:12,167 --> 00:50:15,467
While I'm home, no more
 snacks for you.

521
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:17,077
- Fine. 
 - Okay.

522
00:50:17,077 --> 00:50:18,707
"Okay"?

523
00:50:18,707 --> 00:50:20,897
"Okay"?

524
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,687
Young Joon?

525
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:25,887
Yes, Ms. Na. Are you here?

526
00:50:25,887 --> 00:50:27,037
"Okay"?

527
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:28,097
"Okay"?

528
00:50:28,097 --> 00:50:30,107
I'll change and be right down.

529
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:31,527
You said that?

530
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,127
There.

531
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:46,567
There.

532
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:47,747
Eat this one.

533
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:51,447
How come you don't look
 like you just gave birth?

534
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,777
Did you lose the swelling
 during the labor?

535
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:55,797
My stomach still hasn't gone down.

536
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:58,827
I'm so happy to eat lunch out.

537
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:02,807
I was craving food with 
tons of cheese.

538
00:51:02,807 --> 00:51:04,517
Eat a lot.

539
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:06,597
Did you move into 
Mr. Cha's place okay?

540
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:08,027
We finished quickly.

541
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:09,657
I didn't have much stuff to move.

542
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:11,577
At this rate, what if 
you marry Mr. Cha?

543
00:51:11,577 --> 00:51:13,847
Gosh, you're so hasty.

544
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:14,857
Don't even go there.

545
00:51:14,857 --> 00:51:16,897
You've seen Jung Sun and me.

546
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,167
I don't think you need to
 walk down that path.

547
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,187
It's too much paperwork 
when you return single.

548
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:22,917
Just live like that.

549
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,397
Why do you drag me into that?

550
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,827
- Mi Na is happily married, though. 
 - I am?

551
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:30,517
I have four sons.

552
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:33,917
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

553
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:37,377
Seeing a few hopeful examples and 
believing that you can be one of them.

554
00:51:37,377 --> 00:51:39,657
People are so foolish like that.

555
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:41,457
But hope is a good thing.

556
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,367
Perhaps you can put 
your trust in Jin Ho.

557
00:52:15,437 --> 00:52:16,797
 

558
00:52:23,177 --> 00:52:25,177
Father...

559
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:27,467
I'm leaving today.

560
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:30,147
 Okay. I'll see you when you return. 

561
00:52:31,427 --> 00:52:32,517
Okay.

562
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:35,387
Bye now.

563
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:03,467
Oh, you came.

564
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:04,697
I brought you kimchi.

565
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,867
Oh, my God. Great kimchi.

566
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,377
Wow, it's perfectly ripe.

567
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:23,067
Hey.

568
00:53:23,107 --> 00:53:24,997
It'll be delicious with ramen.

569
00:53:24,997 --> 00:53:27,467
Ahjussi, don't eat too
 many ramens.

570
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:29,587
At your age, you should 
consider your health.

571
00:53:29,587 --> 00:53:31,717
You even have
 a rice cooker there.

572
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:34,987
Don't eat ramen. 
Be sure to eat it with rice.

573
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:36,597
All right, man!

574
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:39,447
Your dad nags, too, and now you?

575
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:46,877
You look good.

576
00:53:47,947 --> 00:53:49,257
I'm well.

577
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:54,337
Are you in a new
 relationship or something?

578
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:00,987
I want to try to be happy
 by myself for now.

579
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:05,197
Great. That's not a bad idea.

580
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:14,767
 

581
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:22,367
Here is the wedding 
material you requested.

582
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:27,557
But you know, 
customer Jeon Ye Jin...

583
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:29,947
I heard it's her third marriage.

584
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:33,497
Yeon Ho.

585
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:37,387
Our job is to prepare a wedding that 
customer Jeon Ye Jin desires,

586
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:39,227
not dig into her personal life.

587
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:41,187
Did you upload the file
 I mentioned this morning?

588
00:54:41,187 --> 00:54:42,757
No, not yet.

589
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,937
Should I do it?

590
00:54:49,937 --> 00:54:51,287
No, sir.

591
00:54:53,947 --> 00:54:56,897
I'm sure he graduated from
 a good college. Geez...

592
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:14,317
 

593
00:56:31,407 --> 00:56:33,107
Are you doing well?

594
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,517
You're well, right?

595
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:39,827
Yeah.

596
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:41,367
I'm good.

597
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:49,417
I thought this after 
parting ways with you.

598
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:54,967
If I hadn't met you, to begin with,

599
00:56:54,967 --> 00:56:57,037
would that have been better?

600
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,497
But that was not the case.

601
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:13,917
I was still glad...

602
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:15,737
that I had met you.

603
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:23,487
I don't regret the time with you.

604
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:29,777
I wish you'd keep only
 the good memories.

605
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:33,817
I will.

606
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:42,767
Thank you for everything.

607
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:48,977
Thank you so much.

608
00:57:56,027 --> 00:57:57,477
Take care.

609
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:01,977
You, too.

610
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:06,387
I'll go now.

611
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:26,567
â™«  Did we ever even 
love each other?  â™«

612
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:35,897
â™«  The days we spent together 
pass by like the wind  â™«

613
00:58:39,207 --> 00:58:41,687
â™«  At one moment...  â™«

614
00:58:41,687 --> 00:58:44,507
 

615
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:55,367
â™«  The world feels like a birdcage 
when I looked from afar  â™«

616
00:58:57,447 --> 00:59:04,587
â™«  It feels as if a summer rain
 shower is pouring down  â™«

617
00:59:07,107 --> 00:59:16,077
â™«  My heart that was soaked 
seems to have dried up  â™«

618
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:20,977
â™«  Everything goes by  â™«

619
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:26,487
â™«  It's all right now  â™«

620
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:31,487
â™«  I have no desire to 
give into hatred  â™«

621
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:35,507
â™«  I will try smiling  â™«

622
00:59:35,507 --> 00:59:40,507
â™«  Everything goes by  â™«

623
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:45,987
â™«  Even love does  â™«

624
00:59:45,987 --> 00:59:51,017
â™«  The weak woman 
no longer exists  â™«

625
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:54,517
â™«  I will move forward  â™«
