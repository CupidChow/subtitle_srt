1
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,714
 

2
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:02,784
I'm here on Vice President's orders.

3
00:01:13,894 --> 00:01:16,024
This is all I have at home.

4
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:28,984
Vice President told me
 to give you this.

5
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,394
It feels weird.

6
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:36,594
Showing myself like 
this to a stranger.

7
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,314
If you need anything...

8
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:45,444
give me a call.

9
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,834
 

10
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,464
Well, then. I'll get going.

11
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,394
But the coffee...

12
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:09,344
Oh, here...

13
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:15,594
It's an old door.

14
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:18,694
Well, then.

15
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,244
Who is it?

16
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:50,334
 Yes, I'm here to fix the door. 

17
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,864
But I didn't call for you.

18
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:02,134
Hang on a second.

19
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:06,524
Mr. Park Sung Joon sent me.

20
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:10,234
It's this door, right?

21
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,844
Well, yes.

22
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:25,524
 

23
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:32,524
Thank you.

24
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:45,294
Is it someone you know?

25
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:46,934
Oh, no.

26
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,134
Hey.

27
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:51,314
That's Sung Un Department 
Store's star couple.

28
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,824
Do you know them?

29
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:56,734
Everyone here knows those two.

30
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,904
That guy is Vice President's 
right-hand man.

31
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:04,284
The rumor has it he'll be the 
youngest executive soon.

32
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:07,484
On top of that, she's 
from a rich family,

33
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,674
and super nice to boot.

34
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,224
Aigoo.

35
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:15,574
For people like that, life 
must be like a happy song.

36
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:20,664
If you think about it, everyone 
must have their own destiny.

37
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:23,864
Geez. In my next life,

38
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,014
I don't want an ordinary destiny.

39
00:04:26,014 --> 00:04:28,334
I want to live like that woman.

40
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:41,624
 

41
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:21,304
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:25,414
I know I shouldn't contact you, but...

43
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,024
But today...

44
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,664
Today was really...

45
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:21,664
I'm sorry.

46
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,594
But...

47
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,594
thank you for coming.

48
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:37,954
You seem to be feeling better.

49
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:39,574
I'll go then.

50
00:08:19,084 --> 00:08:21,874
 

51
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:33,064
Where are you?

52
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:36,834
I was about to call you.

53
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:42,754
Vice President is submitting a report
 to the Chairman in the morning.

54
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:45,074
I have to go to the office.

55
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,894
Will you be very late?

56
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:51,044
I think it will be difficult
 to talk tonight.

57
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,334
 Let's talk tomorrow. 

58
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:56,374
I'm okay with you being
 late. I'll wait.

59
00:08:57,324 --> 00:09:00,444
I think I'll finish in the early a.m.

60
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:02,264
Come even if you're late.

61
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:03,734
I can't delay any longer.

62
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,924
 I'll wait at home. 

63
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:31,704
Who is it?

64
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,384
 It's me. 

65
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:41,294
 Open it. 

66
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,214
When did you find this place?

67
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:11,964
How did you come?

68
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:14,504
You didn't tell me, so I followed you.

69
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,234
You don't have a man here.

70
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:23,004
Geez, it's a joke.

71
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,504
You're giving me a mean look.

72
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:30,424
Eat.

73
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:32,114
I'm okay.

74
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,084
I brought it for you, Honey.

75
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:35,684
You looked so listless all day.

76
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,674
Am I the best husband or what?

77
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,814
Buying porridge for my estranged
 wife so she won't get sick.

78
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:40,704
What about the kids?

79
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:42,494
Aunt is watching them.

80
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,874
I'll go home after you eat.

81
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:47,904
Are you okay?

82
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,194
I feel sick. I'll eat it later.

83
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,984
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

84
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,544
No, I'm fine.

85
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,024
One might think you have 
morning sickness.

86
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,904
No, no, no.

87
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,654
My bad.

88
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:06,714
Actually, Ms. Na asked if we're 
thinking about a third child.

89
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:09,834
I told her she shouldn't 
say such scary things.

90
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,054
- Ms. Na said that? 
 - Yeah.

91
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:15,114
But another baby will be cute, right?

92
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:17,394
We didn't know how to raise
 Young Joon and Seo Joon.

93
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:18,894
They're so big already.

94
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:22,434
At times, I'm sad they're 
grown already.

95
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,954
Well, I didn't raise them, but...

96
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:29,904
You should go. Aunt needs 
to go home, too.

97
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:31,294
Right.

98
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:33,034
But still...

99
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,324
now that I know where you are,

100
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:38,334
you won't collapse
 somewhere and die alone.

101
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:44,364
You know, "dok guh" 
(sounds like "live alone") die.

102
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:46,714
"Dok guh sah." 
(sounds like dying alone)

103
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:51,194
I think I lost my touch. 
My jokes are falling flat.

104
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,834
I have to step it up. I'll get going.

105
00:11:57,984 --> 00:11:59,894
You're okay, right?

106
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:01,744
About what?

107
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,904
Well, it's just...

108
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:06,044
Nothing major going on, right?

109
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:08,834
No.

110
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,464
All righty, then.

111
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,754
But don't take too long.

112
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:15,884
You know how impatient I am.

113
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:17,624
You have to come back soon.

114
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,334
Just get going.

115
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:24,834
Bye now.

116
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:26,774
Get some rest.

117
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:32,514
Go in.

118
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,634
Tell me.

119
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:03,704
At first...

120
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,514
I didn't know it'd turn out like this.

121
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:23,114
Let's go.

122
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,634
Transfer her to a less 
strenuous department.

123
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:37,304
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,574
 I met her through work. 

125
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:50,834
 Oh, here... 

126
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:56,374
 It's an old door. 

127
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,104
 Well, then. 

128
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,214
 I learned of her 
situation by chance. 

129
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,364
 "Her life can't be easy..." 

130
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,304
 That's all I thought. 

131
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:24,924
Thank you.

132
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,554
 It wasn't anything more, but... 

133
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:44,114
I'm not sure how...

134
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:45,974
this all happened.

135
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,944
Are you saying it was
 simply out of pity?

136
00:15:57,134 --> 00:15:58,624
It was...

137
00:16:01,464 --> 00:16:02,594
at first.

138
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,834
So who is it?

139
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,174
Is it someone I know?

140
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:24,414
I know you took the CCTV
 files from the office.

141
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:27,934
If that text was not true,

142
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,614
would you have gone
 to those lengths?

143
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,894
I took the CCTV footage to see 
who was pulling this prank.

144
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,284
What if I want to see who she is?

145
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,464
From the time we first met...

146
00:16:58,344 --> 00:16:59,544
It's strange, but...

147
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,664
I saw us holding hands 
as we grew old together.

148
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:08,014
I liked that.

149
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:12,054
That you'd be with me in 
the last moments of my life...

150
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:15,934
It gave me comfort.

151
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:20,774
So even after I did 
such a crazy thing,

152
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:22,974
I wanted to cover it up.

153
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:27,224
I wanted to live as if 
nothing had happened.

154
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:32,234
Jung Sun, I said it was
 for you, but...

155
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:36,584
it was actually for me.

156
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,064
Because thinking of 
those moments every day...

157
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,644
gave me so much warmth.

158
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,344
But...

159
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:53,394
a man who ruined 
everything doesn't deserve it.

160
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:04,674
Jung Sun.

161
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:13,014
Let's end things.

162
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,384
Are you saying we 
should divorce?

163
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:30,584
I'm sorry.

164
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:42,514
Are you seeing that 
woman again?

165
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,494
- No, it's not like that.
- Then...

166
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:45,994
why all of a sudden?

167
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:47,514
Why now?

168
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,014
You can't glue back 
shattered glass...

169
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,824
I know that now.

170
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:01,194
Don't make me laugh.

171
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:03,804
Shattered glass?

172
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:08,294
You're not the one bleeding over 
the shattered glass. It's me.

173
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:11,174
Who are you to decide whether 
we glue it back or not?

174
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:13,424
End things?

175
00:19:15,144 --> 00:19:17,274
Don't you think I've thought of that?

176
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:21,424
I wanted to say it a hundred, 
a thousand times...

177
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,094
but I shoved it back and endured it.

178
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:28,214
Even though I was bleeding like mad.

179
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:33,514
Thinking we could piece it 
back somehow.

180
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:37,334
I held on even though
 it was hurting me.

181
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:38,814
Why?

182
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,854
Because of those ten years 
we spent together.

183
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:45,994
And it shouldn't be ruined
 in a single moment.

184
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,004
Yet you bring up divorce?

185
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:55,414
Is that all that our 
marriage was to you?

186
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:03,254
Was it so trivial that you could 
bring up divorce so easily?

187
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:04,934
It was not trivial.

188
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:10,984
It was a stroke of fortune that a guy like
 me could start a family with you.

189
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:13,024
I wanted to protect it.

190
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:15,794
I thought I could, but

191
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:18,604
I ruined it all like a crazy bastard.

192
00:20:18,604 --> 00:20:21,014
But I wanted to hold onto you.

193
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:24,174
I did everything I could to 
hold onto you, but...

194
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:33,334
I can't do it, Jung Sun.

195
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,444
It's just not working.

196
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:53,324
We should do whatever you want?

197
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,634
Don't make me laugh.

198
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,824
I'll decide whether we end it or not.

199

215
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,344
The review of the Tifóne exhibition.

216
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,354
The first round from
 yesterday's event.

217
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:01,514
Thank you.

218
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,594
Are you okay?

219
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:10,954
About what?

220
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,294
Fine, then.

221
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:15,884
The all-mighty Lee Hyun Ah
 shouldn't waver over such.

222
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:18,124
Why didn't you tell me?

223
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:19,994
Because word might get out?

224
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:21,904
If so, that makes me sad.

225
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,904
I'm all about loyalty, you know.

226
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,594
It's not anything pleasant.

227
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,604
I'm off.

228
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:37,104
Sang Woo, watch your mouth.

229
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:38,644
Pardon?

230
00:23:45,654 --> 00:23:47,304
What's up with the wink?

231
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:15,704
Profit from the auction surpassed
 the expected amount.

232
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,424
Great work.

233
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:20,454
These results will be 
good enough to show.

234
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:22,704
Send it to Senior Managing Director Choi 
and Managing Director Park.

235
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:24,664
I sent it via email this morning.

236
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,134
Okay, good job.

237
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,524
They've been on Father's 
side for a long time.

238
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,814
Let's show our strength
 to reassure them.

239
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:32,844
We can't show them any flaws.

240
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:34,014
Yes, sir.

241
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:40,384
Did Yoo Ri report to work?

242
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,564
Yes, sir.

243
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,974
Okay.

244
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:48,524
Please take care of her.

245
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,344
Yes, sir.

246
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,714
All right.

247
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:19,204
Ms. Na.

248
00:25:19,204 --> 00:25:21,934
I was supposed to lunch 
with a valet company's CEO,

249
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,854
but a meeting came up.

250
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:27,634
If you have time, 
could you please go?

251
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,254
We have to get the list as well.

252
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,234
Sure.

253
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,274
Yoo Ri.

254
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:34,354
You should go with Ms. Na.

255
00:25:34,354 --> 00:25:37,564
After all, you were 
working alongside me.

256
00:25:37,564 --> 00:25:38,934
I'll be back.

257
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:43,824
I'll go instead.

258
00:25:45,024 --> 00:25:47,264
This is not fun and games.

259
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,474
Geez, this can't be...

260
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,744
- Yoo Ri, let's get ready and go. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

261
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:23,674
Aigoo, Team Leader is
 a man after all.

262
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,324
Are you okay?

263
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,754
Yes.

264
00:27:31,164 --> 00:27:32,394
Sorry.

265
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:36,494
Ms. Na, are you okay?

266
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:38,634
I'm not feeling too well.

267
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:39,944
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,724
Well, yesterday was a big event...

269
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:46,954
Yoo Ri, are you okay
 from yesterday?

270
00:27:51,174 --> 00:27:52,694
Yes, I'm fine.

271
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,654
I'm not in a place to 
say anything, but...

272
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,734
if it's a misunderstanding,
 wouldn't it be

273
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:01,544
good not to provide the cause?

274
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,734
Even more so, if it's not 
a misunderstanding.

275
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,764
For both you...

276
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,714
and the VP's wife.

277
00:28:22,224 --> 00:28:23,504
May I...

278
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,604
Hello?

279
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:30,994
What?

280
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,996
She was already weak. 
Then she caught pneumonia.

281
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,186
Her condition has worsened.

282
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:45,796
She's stabilized for now,

283
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:48,016
so let's monitor her condition.

284
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,096
Okay.

285
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,966
Mom...

286
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,486
Please don't be sick.

287
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,366
You can't get sick.

288
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,786
Okay?

289
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,526
Your mother will be fine.

290
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:27,516
I didn't want to show 
you this, Ms. Na.

291
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,026
My apologies.

292
00:29:32,026 --> 00:29:33,736
It's all right.

293
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:39,706
She seems like she 
was a good mother.

294
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,876
I was able to endure everything
 because of my mom.

295
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:48,656
Without her, I...

296
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:56,126
Because of me, I think...

297
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,266
my mom is being 
punished in my place.

298
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:07,166
That's not true.

299
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,746
She'll get better because 
of you, Yoo Ri.

300
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:22,616
We have to get back.

301
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,496
 

302
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:34,256
You stay here today.

303
00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:37,106
No, the doctor said she'll be fine.

304
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,156
I'll come back after work.

305
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:41,776
I'll be right out.

306
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:42,986
Okay.

307
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,346
 

308
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:09,546
 
 I met her through work 

309
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,866
 I learned of her situation by chance. 

310
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,166
 

311
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,866
 
 "Her life can't be easy..." 

312
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:20,196
 That's all I thought. 

313
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:27,136
Yoo Ri, I have to stop 
by somewhere.

314
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,566
You can get back to the
 office by yourself, right?

315
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,126
Yes.

316
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,706
See you later.

317
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:44,096
Manager Lee.

318
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,036
Take a look at this.

319
00:31:52,236 --> 00:31:54,646
 

320
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,766
 

321
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:15,706
 Our next news. 

322
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,926
 Sung Un Department Store's Vice 
President Ha Jae Woong's wife  

323
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:21,266
 was caught on video power-tripping, 
causing a controversy. 

324
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:24,966
 After this clip was uploaded 
to an anonymous website, 

325
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:28,036
 all the current real-time 
online searches 

326
00:32:28,036 --> 00:32:30,076
 are regarding this wine incident. 

327
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,466
Director Bae, did you 
see the article?

328
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:36,056
- By chance, that video...
 - I thought you'd be cautious.

329
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:38,186
You're more careless
 than I thought.

330
00:32:39,406 --> 00:32:40,256
Pardon?

331
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:43,476
Many eyes are watching.

332
00:32:43,476 --> 00:32:45,746
Why come and see me right now?

333
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:50,616
Don't worry.

334
00:32:50,616 --> 00:32:53,536
What you're worried 
about won't happen.

335
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,556
I'll summon you soon.

336
00:32:56,556 --> 00:32:58,346
Let's talk outside.

337
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,126
Okay?

338
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:03,326
Yes, sir.

339
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,106
Reporter.

340
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:20,996
I'll tell you after we 
sort things out.

341
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:24,066
We're not able to 
comment right now.

342
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,746
I'll call you.

343
00:33:25,746 --> 00:33:27,096
Okay.

344
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:30,096
You're back?

345
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:34,556
A catering employee 
released the clip.

346
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,936
A catering employee?

347
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:37,556
They must've filmed it secretly.

348
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:39,976
It's nuts. The situation
 is out of hand.

349
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,946
At that angle, it had to be
 taken from the stage.

350
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:46,436
When were the catering 
employees on stage?

351
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:49,326
For now, ask the PR Team to send 
us the rebuttal materials.

352
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:50,416
Okay.

353
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,356
What do we do?

354
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:03,626
What now?

355
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:08,816
 

356
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,246
It's spiraling out of control.

357
00:34:14,246 --> 00:34:16,636
Her personal info is 
already exposed.

358
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:22,416
 

359
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,196
 

360
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:28,056
Being in the spotlight last time is 
working against her now.

361
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,856
Yoo Ri, you should go home.

362
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,006
No. I'm fine.

363
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:36,346
This is an emergency. 
I should work.

364
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:39,826
You being here right now
 creates more work for us.

365
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:42,046
You see, right?

366
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:48,636
The reporters are 
probably at your house.

367
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:50,256
Stay elsewhere for a few days.

368
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,066
My apologies.

369
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,746
If it weren't for my error that day...

370
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:30,926
It wasn't your fault from the start.

371
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,866
How can I blame you?

372
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:35,076
It's already a done deal.

373
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:37,316
We must look for a solution.

374
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:39,926
What about public opinion?

375
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,626
It's not good.

376
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:45,316
All right.

377
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:51,696
Petitions are stating that the 
Vice President should resign.

378
00:35:51,696 --> 00:35:54,336
The internal opinions 
share the sentiment.

379
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:57,666
Look who's in a hole now.

380
00:35:57,666 --> 00:36:01,856
Even Ha Jae Woong won't 
get out of this easily, right?

381
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:04,116
One false move,

382
00:36:04,116 --> 00:36:07,806
and his wife and Dae Han 
Group will turn against him.

383
00:36:07,806 --> 00:36:10,886
No one must know
 we orchestrated this.

384
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,286
No need to worry 
about the aftermath.

385
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:15,516
We'll make sure there 
aren't any issues.

386
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,426
I want to see how an 
auction event runs.

387
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:35,546
Taking photos and videos are
 prohibited inside the venue.

388
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:38,746
That's why I'm asking 
you separately, Mi Na.

389
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:41,946
The Management Team may combine
 with the Marketing Team later on.

390
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:44,236
Shouldn't I see these 
things in advance?

391
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,466
It doesn't seem like 
a difficult task.

392
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:50,506
Right?

393
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:53,486
I understand, sir.

394
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:32,226
Mi Na.

395
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:33,716
Mi Na!

396
00:37:34,576 --> 00:37:35,676
Mi Na.

397
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:37,346
- Are you okay?
- Mi Na.

398
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:39,286
What's wrong with her?
 Let me call.

399
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:40,346
Mi Na.

400
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,046
I'm sorry.

401
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:53,386
They said you shouldn't overdo it.

402
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:59,176
Assistant Manager Lee
 didn't seem to know...

403
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,066
I didn't tell him.

404
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,996
I wasn't going to tell
 the team, either.

405
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,936
But I guess everyone found out.

406
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:15,636
Why didn't you want to tell us?

407
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,456
Because I won't have the baby.

408
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:26,256
Please don't tell my husband.

409
00:38:37,116 --> 00:38:39,116
Why did you come 
out that night?

410
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,906
The one who sent the text...

411
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:48,586
It was you...

412
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:56,876
I was afraid of rumors
 spreading at work.

413
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,596
I wanted to see who 
was behind the prank.

414
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:06,656
I'm not sure what you 
were thinking, but...

415
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:09,596
it's not me.

416
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:14,536
What's not you?

417
00:39:17,846 --> 00:39:18,906
Pardon?

418
00:39:25,426 --> 00:39:26,356
Hey!

419
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:29,726
You're here.

420
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:31,786
Vice President is holding 
a press conference.

421
00:39:33,566 --> 00:39:35,166
 

422
00:39:44,736 --> 00:39:48,776
I offer my sincerest apologies 
and regret for troubling

423
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,746
all the citizens with this incident.

424
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,696
 

425
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:05,746
The reason I stand here today

426
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,926
is due to certain facts 
being misreported.

427
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:11,086
I wanted to offer an explanation.

428
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:15,586
The woman in the video
 clip who's currently

429
00:40:15,586 --> 00:40:19,106
being speculated as my mistress...

430
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,266
is my daughter.

431
00:40:30,586 --> 00:40:34,256
There was a woman whom
 I had dated back in college.

432
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:38,056
Since I had no contact 
with her afterward,

433
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:39,696
I was not aware of my 
daughter's existence,

434
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:42,576
and I learned of this only recently.

435
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:45,336
 This is my negligence
 and wrongdoing. 

436
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:48,346
 But due to my negligence, 

437
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,406
 I could no longer 
standby and watch an 

438
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:54,036
 innocent family member fall 
under ruthless speculation. 

439
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,436
 This is why I'm revealing the truth. 

440
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:01,306
 For causing concern because
 of my personal family matters. 

441
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:03,806
 My apologies once again. 

442
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,036
I'm sorry.

443
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,596
Just kill me instead.

444
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,076
A mistress...

445
00:41:14,076 --> 00:41:17,606
will go away after people 
are done talking about it.

446
00:41:17,606 --> 00:41:19,896
But a child out of wedlock?

447
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,436
The flaw that'll haunt 
us for life, yet

448
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,436
you want to tell the entire world?

449
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:30,636
If this becomes a mistress issue,

450
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:35,186
the company will fall 
under due to moral issues.

451
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:36,476
However...

452
00:41:37,566 --> 00:41:39,696
if it's perceived as 
a family-related issue,

453
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:43,326
the media will frame it differently.

454
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,706
Which means I must 
reveal the truth.

455
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:49,706
That's your problem.

456
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,996
I know it's all my fault.

457
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,236
But Myung Eun...

458
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,586
Please help me just once.

459
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:06,506
I can't step back right now.

460
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:14,556
 

461
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,996
Don't let anyone hear you 
breathe and stay hidden.

462
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:44,376
As if you don't exist.

463
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:02,746
 This On Yoo Ri's number, correct? 

464
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:05,556
Who's calling, please?

465
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,536
 I'm Reporter Kim Il Seob
 from Hanyang Daily. 

466
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:13,666
 Since I had no contact 
with her afterward, 

467
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,686
This is huge.

468
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:17,756
 and I learned of this only recently. 

469
00:43:17,756 --> 00:43:19,756
I didn't do anything 
to Yoo Ri, right?

470
00:43:19,756 --> 00:43:21,876
Geez, did I?

471
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,466
Gosh, I'm always
 running my mouth.

472
00:43:24,466 --> 00:43:26,076
I can't trust myself.

473
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:28,066
 - Because of my negligence... 
- I'm sure I said...

474
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,876
something weird, huh?

475
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,716
This makes things awkward.

476
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:36,966
The newbie turns out to
 be the VP's daughter.

477
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:39,966
Did Team Leader Park
 know all along?

478
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:51,166
My apologies.

479
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,376
I wasn't aware of this.

480
00:43:54,346 --> 00:43:57,006
But can't we raise moral issues 
for a child out of wedlock?

481
00:43:57,006 --> 00:43:59,676
He didn't have her 
after he got married.

482
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:02,696
He's saying he didn't
 know. It won't work.

483
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:05,076
He's saying he'll take
 full responsibility

484
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,866
and even pretending 
to bow his head!

485
00:44:07,866 --> 00:44:10,316
How on earth would that work?

486
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:11,426
Huh?

487
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:15,446
 

488
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,356
 The phone is turned off.  

489
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,156
 You'll be connected 
to the voicemail. 

490
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,396
 After the beep, 
there will be a charge. 

491
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:42,766
 

492
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:50,666
 

493
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:54,366
 

494
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:05,846
 

495
00:45:10,066 --> 00:45:11,666
 

496
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:17,746
 

497
00:45:35,786 --> 00:45:37,236
Team Leader.

498
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:40,706
What will happen to Yoo Ri?

499
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:43,216
Will she stay on our team?

500
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:45,756
Yes, no changes in particular.

501
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:47,596
Please continue as usual.

502
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:52,696
Our ranking has changed.

503
00:45:52,696 --> 00:45:55,526
Yet there won't be any 
changes in particular?

504
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,116
Yes, this is Park Sung Joon.

505
00:46:13,116 --> 00:46:16,366
 It's me, Yoo Ri. 

506
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:22,546
Why don't we have her come in?

507
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:26,336
Now?

508
00:46:27,256 --> 00:46:31,156
The reporters are camped out in
 front of the department store.

509
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,986
If she's photographed
 coming in to work,

510
00:46:32,986 --> 00:46:34,976
the main articles will 
deviate from the

511
00:46:34,976 --> 00:46:37,416
scandal and will focus
 on Yoo Ri herself.

512
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:40,226
Rather than the video
 clip being revived,

513
00:46:40,226 --> 00:46:42,016
that seems to be better.

514
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:44,266
We should manipulate the press?

515
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:49,906
Will she be able to endure that?

516
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:53,506
She will have to endure
 it at least once.

517
00:46:53,506 --> 00:46:55,756
Facing it straight on...

518
00:46:55,756 --> 00:46:59,526
will minimize the blow for 
Yoo Ri as well in the end.

519
00:47:03,356 --> 00:47:05,726
Are you in contact with your father?

520
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:07,016
Are you really the VP's daughter?

521
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:08,636
Are you in contact with him?

522
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:22,636
I'm sorry for worrying everyone.

523
00:48:07,156 --> 00:48:09,166
- Yes, Mother. I'm almost there.
- All right.

524
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,216
All right.

525
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:13,026
Don't hurry and drive safely.

526
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,916
But Mother.

527
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:17,446
Jung Sun is not feeling well today...

528
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:19,686
Jung Sun is not feeling well?

529
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,496
Then you should let
 her rest at home.

530
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:23,506
Why send her over so early?

531
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:25,496
Jung Sun is over there?

532
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:27,046
You didn't know?

533
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:29,896
She came over earlier, but 
she didn't let on. I had no idea.

534
00:48:29,896 --> 00:48:31,366
Hey, she's setting the table.

535
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,996
Okay, take your time.

536
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,556
I'll tell her to take a break.

537
00:48:35,696 --> 00:48:36,776
Okay.

538
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:49,646
Mother, this is so good.

539
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,366
I packed some for you
 guys. Take some.

540
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:53,786
Thank you.

541
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,646
Why aren't you eating?

542
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:01,116
I'm okay.

543
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:07,396
My friend said she 
might get a divorce.

544
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:09,866
A divorce?

545
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,676
Why?

546
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,836
Her husband cheated on her,

547
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:17,636
but he wants to get a divorce.

548
00:49:17,636 --> 00:49:19,446
Oh, dear.

549
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:25,086
She's asking what she should do,

550
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:28,156
but I'm not sure what to say.

551
00:49:29,426 --> 00:49:31,236
From what I've seen,

552
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:35,706
the pain you inflict returns to you.

553
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,996
Even if he goes to 
another woman,

554
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:41,026
they won't live well.

555
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:47,386
If something like that
 happens to me...

556
00:49:47,386 --> 00:49:48,856
Nonsense.

557
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:50,716
It'll never happen, but

558
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:53,426
even if it did, I'd be 
more upset than you.

559
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,106
Keep that in mind.

560
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:05,616
This is so delicious, Mother.

561
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,226
How did you make it?

562
00:50:07,226 --> 00:50:09,426
I'll pack some side 
dishes, too. Take them.

563
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,576
No, it's okay. You should
 eat them, too.

564
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:13,366
I made plenty, so it's okay.

565
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:14,766
Thank you.

566
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:17,356
- Have some short ribs.
- Okay.

567
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:38,516
Thanks for today.

568
00:50:38,516 --> 00:50:41,146
- But now...
- I came to show you.

569
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:45,316
If we get divorced,

570
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:48,006
your mom, my dad,

571
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,166
and the entire family 
will get hurt.

572
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:55,906
That's what you're trying to do.

573
00:50:57,126 --> 00:50:58,566
Take a good look.

574
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:01,836
See what you've ruined.

575
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,816
Do you need anything?

576
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:08,506
It's ready.

577
00:51:08,506 --> 00:51:10,146
- Please sit.
- Okay.

578
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,946
- Let me use the bathroom. 
- All right.

579
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,406
By any chance...

580
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:21,466
Never mind.

581
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:23,586
I shouldn't think needless things.

582
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:27,596
After seeing your father, 
there's no way you would.

583
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:34,596
- Mother, do you need anything else? 
 - No, no.

584
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:36,266
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

585
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:55,646
Yes, Vice President.

586
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,866
 

587
00:51:56,876 --> 00:52:00,426
The reporters are already onto 
the hotel Yoo Ri is staying at.

588
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:04,216
Move her discreetly to 
the Hannamdong studio.

589
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,056
 

590
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:32,676
 I'm outside the hotel room. 

591
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:35,346
 Please pack your things. 
I'll escort you somewhere else. 

592
00:52:49,846 --> 00:52:50,976
 On Yoo Ri! 

593
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:51,966
 On Yoo Ri. 

594
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:53,036
- Let's go.
 - On Yoo Ri! 

595
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,066
 Do you have a minute? 

596
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:55,136
 On Yoo Ri! 

597
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:57,006
 When did you find out 
about your father? 

598
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:58,686
 - On Yoo Ri!
- Give us a statement. 

599
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:16,166
Can we please go to my mom?

600
00:54:39,596 --> 00:54:42,916
Vice President will 
send a driver in an hour.

601
00:54:45,236 --> 00:54:47,866
We prepared a place for
 you in Hannamdong.

602
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:51,606
The security is very tight, 
so the reporters won't get in.

603
00:54:57,296 --> 00:54:58,376
Well, then.

604
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,786
We shouldn't have...

605
00:55:03,786 --> 00:55:06,516
started in the first place.

606
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:11,796
Then it wouldn't hurt this bad.

607
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:50,886
 

608
00:55:56,726 --> 00:55:58,576
Daebak.

609
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:10,586
 

610
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:11,666
This is major.

611
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:15,166
 

612
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,716
General Management Department?

613
00:56:16,716 --> 00:56:18,506
It's a minor department.

614
00:56:18,506 --> 00:56:20,186
He got ousted.

615
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:21,736
Oh, no.

616
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:29,166
Oh, Director Park.

617
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,466
Congratulations!

618
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:32,846
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

619
00:56:32,846 --> 00:56:35,806
This team is making history for 
Sung Un Department Store.

620
00:56:35,806 --> 00:56:38,216
Yes, let's give him 
a big round of applause!

621
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:39,556
It's all right.

622
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:40,816
Thank you.

623
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,366
Hey, did the missus 
hear the news?

624
00:57:06,696 --> 00:57:08,836
 

625
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:10,576
 

626
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:35,826
 Is it someone I know? 

627
00:57:35,826 --> 00:57:36,746
 No. 

628
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:38,356
 Everyone has their place. 

629
00:57:38,356 --> 00:57:39,926
 I should have known sooner. 

630
00:57:39,926 --> 00:57:41,936
 Mr. Park Sung Joon
 sent these for you. 

631
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,346
 You said it's over, right? 

632
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:46,986
 And it's someone I don't know. 

633
00:57:46,986 --> 00:57:49,876
 Anything else I should know? 

634
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:52,286
 No. 

635
00:57:52,286 --> 00:57:53,356
It's over.

636
00:57:53,356 --> 00:57:54,576
 I won't ever go back. 

637
00:57:54,576 --> 00:57:55,706
 So you end it, too. 

638
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,646
 Would it be okay if 

639
00:57:57,646 --> 00:57:59,356
 I get what I want? 

640
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:52,546
Congrats.

641
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:11,876
 

642
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:16,576
♫  When I miss the 
smile on your face  ♫

643
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:20,156
♫  Could we ever turn back  ♫

644
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:26,896
♫  And I'll be shameless  ♫

645
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:30,976
♫  Waiting for the day with you  ♫

646
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:37,496
♫  I trust you in the darkness  ♫

647
00:59:37,496 --> 00:59:38,936
♫  Shame on you  ♫

648
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:41,366
 A flaw that I was
 keeping to myself. 

649
00:59:41,366 --> 00:59:44,166
 She found out about it somehow, 
and it was comforting. 

650
00:59:44,226 --> 00:59:47,506
 My feelings for you won't 
go away, Team Leader. 

651
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:50,626
 Fortunately, I'm the only one who 
knows you filmed that clip, Mi Na. 

652
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:51,636
 We'll administer anesthesia. 

653
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:54,166
 The reason I'm here today is 
to tell you something. 

654
00:59:54,186 --> 00:59:56,846
 I'll show you what it's 
like to lose everything. 

655
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:59,666
 Let's go together to hell. 

656
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:03,216
♫  When I miss the 
smile on your face  ♫

657
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,666
♫  I can't turn back  ♫
