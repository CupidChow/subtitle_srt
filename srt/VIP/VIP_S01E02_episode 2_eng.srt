1
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:57,868
 

2
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:25,778
 

3
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:31,068
 

4
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:05,078
 

5
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,068
 

6
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,208
Hello?

7
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:49,008
 

8
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,258
Hello?

9
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,708
 Hey! 

10
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:58,918
Sorry for calling late.

11
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,658
I got a text from this number.

12
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:03,428
 What did you say? 

13
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,598
I was wondering if you sent a text.

14
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:08,608
 What? 

15
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,278
 Send what? 

16
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,918
 Who are you? 

17
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:14,278
 Why call in the middle of the night? 

18
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,938
I apologize.

19
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:19,048
I think I have the wrong
 number. I'm sorry.

20
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,528
My apologies.

21
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:52,408
You got a text message
 late last night.

22
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,198
A text?

23
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,168
Maybe it's spam?

24
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,018
Really?

25
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,738
What about it?

26
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,498
No, I was just...

27
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:05,468
I was wondering who
 it was so late at night.

28
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,598
I saw that your cellphone is locked.

29
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,178
They did it for me at the store. 
It's always been that way.

30
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,748
Is that right?

31
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:23,148
But then, it's not like 
I look at your cellphone.

32
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,728
So what is it?

33
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:31,948
Your password.

34
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,078
0000.

35
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:50,658
Do you remember what you said 
when you proposed to me?

36
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:26,148
Why are you making a fist?

37
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:27,078
Huh?

38
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:38,808
What is the ring for?

39
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:40,428
Well...

40
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:44,018
- that's...
- Why do you have sweaty palms?

41
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:52,278
Geez, I had prepared what to say...

42
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:55,428
I don't remember it at all.

43
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:05,448
As you know,

44
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,838
the reality is that I can't
 do much for you.

45
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,868
Truthfully, I don't even 
know if I should say this.

46
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:24,848
But I'll promise this.

47
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,198
Even through our toughest moments,

48
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,478
I won't let go of your hand.

49
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,338
The only thing I can pledge
 right now is my heart.

50
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,128
But my heart...

51
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,908
I'll do my best to feel 
this way forever.

52
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:08,868
Will you marry me?

53
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,798
How does it look? Pretty?

54
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:25,728
I'm so happy.

55
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,858
I'm curious all of a sudden.

56
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:35,868
Do you still feel the same way?

57
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:43,888
Yes.

58
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,208
The heatwave seems 
to be over now.

59
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,518
 

60
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,928
 

61
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,818
Ms. Na, the meeting.

62
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,218
Oh, okay.

63
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:43,298
This week, we'll inspect the 
VIP Services Dept. in action.

64
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,968
First, an inspection of 
the concierge services...

65
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,468
Ms. Na, I'll leave you in charge.

66
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:48,588
Yes, sir.

67
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:52,818
Mystery shoppers will 
evaluate each branch's event.

68
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:57,278
Today's VIP pre-opening event at the 
Cheongdam branch in collaboration with Eterno.

69
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,968
- Ms. Lee, please check on that.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,178
These reports are for Vice President.

71
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:03,568
Please check over meticulously.

72
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:05,228
 Yes, sir. Will do. 

73
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:09,108
We'll be slaving away
 this entire week.

74
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,428
Mi Na.

75
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:13,518
Of the concierge services, combine the 
reports for the most popular one

76
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:15,768
- and the details of the claim for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

77
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:18,908
Yoo Ri, come with me today.

78
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,598
- So you can scope out the scene.
- Okay.

79
00:09:21,598 --> 00:09:24,298
But what is a mystery shopper?

80
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,628
Someone pretending to be 
a customer and observing them.

81
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:30,088
A type of a spy.

82
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,228
Manager Lee, can I go, too?

83
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:36,538
A crazy line has been forming
 there since the day before.

84
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,218
Then who'll maintain the office?

85
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:40,748
Man...

86
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:02,518
You should re-do your tie.

87
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:09,788
Yeah.

88
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,068
Thanks.

89
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:15,838
So...

90
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:17,348
last night...

91
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,808
Let's talk later.

92
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:44,288
Have a good time.

93
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:47,048
I'll maintain the office alone.

94
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:48,348
Thanks.

95
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,238
Sure.

96
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:51,428
Shall we get going?

97
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:57,938
I'd forgotten your attire 
for a sec, Yoo Ri.

98
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:08,818
We're pretending to be
 VIPs at a VIP event.

99
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,968
If they see your, well...

100
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:15,208
clean cut attire,

101
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,498
they'd have a hard time 
believing you're a VIP.

102
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:21,338
But this looks expensive.

103
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,188
Don't worry. They do rentals, too.

104
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,368
- Hello.
- Hi.

105
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,408
Today, it's not for me.

106
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,508
We're here for her.

107
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:35,408
We'll be renting.

108
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,908
Can you show us 
suitable outfits for her?

109
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:38,838
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,128
Let's take off the earrings.

111
00:11:58,128 --> 00:11:59,398
Okay.

112
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,128
By chance, do you 
have a hairdryer?

113
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,128
"Clothes make the woman."

114
00:12:28,128 --> 00:12:30,078
No wonder such a saying exists.

115
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,358
Sejin Group's 
President Kim Hyun Cheol

116
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,658
booked limousine services 
and the yacht for today.

117
00:12:41,658 --> 00:12:44,108
He's been frequenting
 the concierge services.

118
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,178
Let's confirm the
 limousine pick up first.

119
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:46,948
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,238
Wait, Mi Na.

121
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:50,108
Yes?

122
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:54,818
When you text these days, you can't 
change the number it's sent from, right?

123
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:57,428
- I believe so.
- Right?

124
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,808
A single text.

125
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,718
Is this about sending out 
texts for our events?

126
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,988
No, I received a strange text.

127
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,048
A strange text?

128
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,698
It's nothing. Kind of
 like a chain letter.

129
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,028
 - Geez, my feet hurt.
- We've been waiting so long. 

130
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,558
Are we allowed to go in like this?

131
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,538
Everyone is in line.

132
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,708
Regular customers stand in line.

133
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,228
For the VIPs, there's 
a pre-opening an hour before.

134
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:30,898
That's VIPs' special privileges.

135
00:13:36,788 --> 00:13:40,758
The limousine arrived 
10 minutes early and on standby.

136
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,168
Is that President Kim's daughter?

137
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:56,478
President Kim Hyun Cheol only 
has a junior high aged son.

138
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:57,478
You're right.

139
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:01,468
The address is 
President Kim Hyun Cheol's.

140
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,058
She looks familiar...

141
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,468
Don't you usually have a limousine
 come to your doorstep?

142
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,498
Why park it on the road...

143
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:17,518
Perhaps someone is
 stealing VIP privileges?

144
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,178
Hey, Sang Woo.

145
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,938
I have a favor to ask.

146
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:27,418
Pardon?

147
00:14:27,418 --> 00:14:29,488
But how...

148
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:31,468
If you can't, ask the PR Team.

149
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:33,308
If they know anyone at Sejin Group.

150
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,878
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,128
Yes, I understand.

152
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:41,968
This team's side gig is 
being a "Yes-man."

153
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:42,868
Seriously.

154
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,968
What's the number again...

155
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,798
 

156
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,778
Hello.

157
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,848
I'm all right.

158
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,658
Do you need anything else?

159
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:11,468
I'll have some water...

160
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,828
- Here.
- Thank you.

161
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,428
Ma'am, are you enjoying 
your shopping spree?

162
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,078
We're about to look around now.

163
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,078
This shopper bag is for the first 
100 VIP guests attending.

164
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,988
It's an exclusive gift 
from this garage sale.

165
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:30,568
It's for comfort and ease during
 your shopping excursion.

166
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:34,038
Okay.

167
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,668
It's nice.

168
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,068
Oh, no!

169
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,768
Gosh, what should I do?

170
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:42,568
What do I do?

171
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,518
Gosh...

172
00:15:43,518 --> 00:15:44,868
I apologize.

173
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:46,858
- Are you okay, Miss?
- Yes.

174
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:50,368
I think you came here with a friend.

175
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:52,718
This isn't the place for such ruckus.

176
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,188
Please be careful.

177
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:55,178
Okay.

178
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,438
Did you get hurt?

179
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,528
I'm okay, but this...

180
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:02,418
Gosh, I'm sorry. 
We'll reimburse you.

181
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,948
No, Miss. We'll take care of it.

182
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:06,168
Thank you.

183
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,388
- Let's get going.
- Why?

184
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,758
Just because...

185
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,568
I think I've seen everything.

186
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:14,668
Here.

187
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:16,668
My apologies.

188
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:18,688
Hey, wait for me.

189
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,018
Our apologies for the trouble.

190
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,818
We'll get this cleaned up.

191
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,328
You brought your outfit
 from earlier, right?

192
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,818
Yes.

193
00:16:47,538 --> 00:16:50,018
She said she's President 
Kim Hyun Cheol's daughter?

194
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:50,848
Yes.

195
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,068
I'll be the server today.

196
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,198
Are you with a party?

197
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:29,938
Yes, they'll be here soon.

198
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,488
I heard you're giving
 away shopper bags.

199
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,148
May I please get one?

200
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:37,538
I need something to put my stuff.

201
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,868
We're out of the
 first-come-first-serve stock.

202
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,138
My apologies.

203
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,688
Do you have any 
shopper bags left?

204
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,468
Yes, I'll bring you one.

205
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,768
We have a limited quantity.

206
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:58,468
Please understand we're not able to
 give them to all customers.

207
00:17:58,498 --> 00:18:01,538
Which customers do
 you give them to?

208
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:03,768
Miss.

209
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:07,548
You may not be aware since it's 
your first time at such an event...

210
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:09,818
First-timers aren't allowed?

211
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:11,628
- Miss.
- Yes?

212
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:18,148
I think your presence will be of 
disturbance to the other customers.

213
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:20,088
Since you're here anyway,

214
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,998
why don't you have a pleasant 
time before you go?

215
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:27,618
You sound as if you're telling me 
to stay quiet if I don't fit in.

216
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:35,418
If you give me a minute, 
I'll bring you a shopper bag.

217
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:40,388
The "friends" are always the problem.

218
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:43,798
At times, people say 
that the employees at

219
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,388
luxury brand shops
 discriminate customers.

220
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,288
I guess the same goes for here.

221
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:55,178
I suppose there are different
 levels of customers.

222
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,408
But what should we do?

223
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:04,108
The customer who left 10 minutes ago
 after breaking a champagne glass...

224
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:08,788
Did you know she's a Black Diamond
 member of our department store?

225
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:12,868
I didn't take good pics 
to upload yet.

226
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,408
Why leave so early?

227
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:16,248
Can't we go back in?

228
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,828
Let's come back next time.

229
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:18,778
You mean it, right?

230
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,538
Bring me to these events again.

231
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,168
All right, I will.

232
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,828
Let me check today's 
guest entrance list.

233
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,018
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:45,708
I think there's been 
a misunderstanding.

235
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,098
Recently, the claims against 
Cheongdam branch's VIP Services

236
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:51,048
have doubled in numbers.

237
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,368
When I checked,

238
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,538
the claims have rapidly increased

239
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,878
after you were assigned here.

240
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,218
It's regrettable,

241
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,468
but the details will be reported
 to the upper management.

242
00:20:00,468 --> 00:20:02,708
Manager Hwang Hyun Jung.

243
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:23,428
 

244
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:27,138
 This is Han So Mi, Sejin Group 
Kim Hyun Cheol's secretary. 

245
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:35,738
This is nice.

246
00:20:39,768 --> 00:20:41,818
- Let me use the bathroom.
- Okay.

247
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,008
Excuse me.

248
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,168
Another bottle of 
champagne, please.

249
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:01,868
I'm Na Jung Sun, Deputy GM of 
Sung Un Department Store's VIP Management Team.

250
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,768
During the site inspection,

251
00:21:03,768 --> 00:21:06,588
it came to light that the 
client is not the same

252
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:08,618
as the one who made 
the reservations.

253
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:09,868
Pardon me, but...

254
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,988
what is your relationship with 
President Kim Hyun Cheol?

255
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,558
He's my dad.

256
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,748
Family members are 
supposed to be okay.

257
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:23,058
We've confirmed that President 
Kim Hyun Cheol only has a son.

258
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,528
He's my uncle, an uncle.

259
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:26,738
Gosh...

260
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:29,428
this department store is no good.

261
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,068
I'll tell my uncle and...

262
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:35,468
Are you Han So Mi, Sejin Group 
President Kim's secretary?

263
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:39,348
Actually...

264
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,918
I won't do it again. 
Please let it go once.

265
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:47,998
This service is only 
meant for the VIP.

266
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:49,458
It's not transferable.

267
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,608
We'll halt this service now,

268
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:54,528
- and report this to the VIP...
- No.

269
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,718
You can't.

270
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,468
That man thinks I'm 
from a wealthy family.

271
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:04,868
If he finds out this was a lie...

272
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:07,658
I can't live without him.

273
00:22:07,658 --> 00:22:08,948
My apologies.

274
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:10,768
We must follow the procedure.

275
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,368
I'll jump.

276
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,198
Over here!

277
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,488
Are you okay?

278
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:50,618
Did you say anything to him?

279
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:53,818
No.

280
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,308
Thank God.

281
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,058
I'll never do this again.

282
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,008
So please look the other
 way this one time.

283
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,158
Please...

284
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,628
Thank you.

285
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,208
I have a bitter taste in my mouth.

286
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:11,308
The customer who broke 
the champagne glass...

287
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:14,458
I didn't think she was a VIP, either.

288
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:18,228
That manager and I are no different.

289
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:22,668
It's like the pot calling
 the kettle black.

290
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:26,508
In the end, people will
 judge by what they see.

291
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:31,198
I had no idea...

292
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:34,308
that the world was 
such a friendly place.

293
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,838
It's friendliness bought with money.

294
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:40,368
But...

295
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:44,108
having a lot of money doesn't 
necessarily equate happiness.

296
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,628
I had to make money to 
survive since high school.

297
00:24:56,918 --> 00:24:59,198
To save money,

298
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,238
I worked part-time at 
the convenience store

299
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:05,608
and ate kimbap that 
had already expired.

300
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:12,308
This one time, I collapsed during 
work and went to the ER.

301
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:14,868
They said it was malnutrition.

302
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,278
The thought which 
popped in my mind then...

303
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,538
was how to pay for the hospital bills.

304
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,758
I was worried about that.

305
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:32,198
Trust me.

306
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:35,688
Not having money...

307
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:38,038
is absolutely worse.

308
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:01,648
 

309
00:26:28,298 --> 00:26:30,898
It suits you well since you're pale.

310
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:39,918
I'll take this one.

311
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:40,918
Okay.

312
00:26:51,358 --> 00:26:54,038
I've heard of secretaries 
using VIP services

313
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,758
using the executive 
board members' names.

314
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:59,378
But this big of a scale was a first.

315
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:02,558
We should examine further to see if 
there are more cases like these.

316
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,478
Make me a list of offices 
that used the recent top-five

317
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:07,188
concierge services tomorrow.

318
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,048
Yes, ma'am.

319
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,078
Will you tell President
 Kim Hyun Cheol?

320
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,808
For now, let's give her 
a severe warning.

321
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:19,408
If it happens one more
 time, we'll tell him.

322
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:21,338
Okay.

323
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,788
The lie will come to light anyway.

324
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:27,398
I know.

325
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:31,718
That's how much she 
wants to cling on.

326
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,378
Even though she knows 
it'll come to an end.

327
00:27:46,614 --> 00:27:48,424
Ma'am, our apologies.

328
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,354
This card has been declined.

329
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:52,224
Do you have another 
one by chance?

330
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:53,844
Declined?

331
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:54,974
Yes.

332
00:27:57,504 --> 00:27:59,604
Can you try this one?

333
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:04,944
I'm sorry.

334
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:07,174
This one has been declined as well.

335
00:28:31,484 --> 00:28:34,414
Excuse me, Miss. 
Would you like a cab?

336
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:35,634
No.

337
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:36,954
It's okay.

338
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,734
 

339
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:37,894
- A long day, huh?
- Yeah.

340
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:39,434
Wash up. I'll get dinner ready.

341
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,114
Thank you.

342
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:43,534
 

343
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,214
Honey, you have a call.

344
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,674
Why would Mr. Cha call so late?

345
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:49,934
Take it.

346
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:56,854
It's work, of course.

347
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:58,904
Yes.

348
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:01,384
I'm dying here, really. Aigoo...

349
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,934
 

350
00:30:20,204 --> 00:30:22,174
Thank you for yesterday, Sang Woo.

351
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:23,864
How did you get the photo?

352
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,074
I asked the PR Team.

353
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,694
It's Assistant Manager Cha, correct?

354
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:30,274
I'll tell him thanks separately later.

355
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:31,064
No.

356
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:33,304
Mr. Cha is on a business trip to China.

357
00:30:33,304 --> 00:30:34,904
So I asked Manager Song.

358
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:37,694
China?

359
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:40,414
Mr. Cha?

360
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:42,174
Since when?

361
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,314
The day before yesterday?

362
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:46,934
It's been a few days.

363
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:49,034
 
 Honey, you have a call. 

364
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:51,084
 Why would Mr. Cha call so late? 

365
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:52,234
 Take it. 

366
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,834
 It's work, of course. 

367
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:56,734
 Yes. 

368
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:03,264
Is there a problem...

369
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:04,414
Oh, no.

370
00:31:04,414 --> 00:31:05,764
Okay.

371
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,944
I'll give Manager Song 
a call separately.

372
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:23,334
This restaurant requires 
reservations a month in advance.

373
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:24,644
It was a difficult feat.

374
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:25,794
Thank you.

375
00:31:25,794 --> 00:31:29,954
Isn't this for your own enjoyment 
and not for a service fraud inspection?

376
00:31:36,084 --> 00:31:38,124
He looks so upset.

377
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:40,834
Assistant Manager Jung was caught 
cheating with a co-worker.

378
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,924
- Assistant Manager Jung?
- Yeah.

379
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:44,904
He doesn't seem like the type.

380
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,534
Don't assume nice guys 
won't be prone to infidelity.

381
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:49,374
Infidelity and one's 
character don't matter.

382
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,594
It happens to those who do.

383
00:31:58,254 --> 00:32:00,784
 He was caught cheating 
with a co-worker. 

384
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:05,014
 I'm not sure if it's a good
 thing his wife found out... 

385
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:12,134
Ms. Na.

386
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:18,154
Regarding Han So Mi, she'll reimburse
 our expenses, and we'll wrap it up.

387
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:21,014
I warned her there 
wouldn't be a next time.

388
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,524
Regarding yesterday...

389
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:26,234
Did I do the right thing 
by lying for her?

390
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:30,734
Perhaps it's best that things
 come to light right then.

391
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:34,854
Mi Na, the meeting.

392
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,064
Okay.

393
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,534
Go on.

394
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,304
That ahjumma is awful.

395
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,874
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes.

396
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,544
We'll make sure all goes well.

397
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:17,914
Everyone seems to 
be working so hard.

398
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,684
I stopped by to cheer you on.

399
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:21,674
This team used to be 
in my department.

400
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:23,904
I couldn't just walk by.

401
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:27,444
Nice seeing a friendly face, too.

402
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:32,434
Is work going okay?

403
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:34,204
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:38,324
It must be much nicer 
than working with

405
00:33:38,324 --> 00:33:40,104
a crackpot like me.

406
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:44,344
Now that Manager Lee is back...

407
00:33:44,344 --> 00:33:46,304
I have no worries.

408
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,734
Then carry on.

409
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:05,104
Let's take a short break.

410
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,844
Let me use the restroom.

411
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,814
Wasn't Ms. Lee...

412
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:17,614
on bad terms with Director Bae?

413
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,494
It seems like that on her end,

414
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:22,884
but Director Bae treats her like...

415
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,574
No, I meant...

416
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:29,294
Manager Lee lost out on the
 promotion to Deputy GM Na.

417
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:32,284
She had it out with Director Bae 
before taking a leave of absence...

418
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:37,034
It's just what I've been hearing...

419
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:38,354
Sang Woo.

420
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:42,714
Go to your desk and bring the last 
6-month branch sales report, will you?

421
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,144
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:48,334
Is the meeting over?

423
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,094
 What about our team's evaluation? 

424
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:53,704
 I'm sure Director Bae will do it. 

425
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:04,834
Director Bae.

426
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,754
Thank you for your concern.

427
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:13,834
Your name...

428
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,714
It's Song Mi Na.

429
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:16,494
I see.

430
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,564
Thank you.

431
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,554
Ms. Na.

432
00:35:47,554 --> 00:35:50,024
Well, my husband was 
supposed to pick up the kids,

433
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,734
but he's running late.

434
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,964
I don't think I can accompany you 
to the site inspection today.

435
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:56,324
Really?

436
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,534
All right, I'll ask someone else.

437
00:35:59,554 --> 00:36:01,094
My apologies, Ms. Na.

438
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:03,084
It's your kids. What can you do...

439
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,224
- Do you have reservations?
- Yes.

440
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,724
It's under Na Jung Sun.

441
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,394
Yes, ma'am. I'll show you in.

442
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:29,684
By chance, could we be seated 
near CEO Jung Ho Il?

443
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,834
I heard he's coming today.

444
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:34,634
He's my friend's father. 
I wanted to say hello.

445
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:36,524
Yes, sir. I'll make the arrangements.

446
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:37,664
Thank you.

447
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,234
- Let's go.
- Okay.

448
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,394
Are you not feeling well?

449
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:01,204
Now that I mention it, 
you don't look well.

450
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,704
I got something on 
my mind, that's why.

451
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,974
They're here.

452
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,574
It seems fraudulent, right?

453
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:15,844
I checked what CEO Jung Ho Il's 
secretary looks like.

454
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:16,904
That's not her.

455
00:37:25,354 --> 00:37:27,904
It is the CEO himself.

456
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:11,784
He's been busy because
 he's got a woman.

457
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,264
I know.

458
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,894
His wife is a nice lady...

459
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:42,114
Go wash up.

460
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,934
You don't look so well.

461
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,534
Honey, let's talk.

462
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,134
I'm going to the market.

463
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:56,004
I'm going, too!

464
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:57,614
To the market!

465
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,424
- Should I go with you?
- Who'll watch the kids?

466
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,394
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

467
00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:04,584
Honey.

468
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:05,764
A stamp.

469
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:13,854
I'm going to eat up Seo Joon!

470
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,444
 

471
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,094
Take it.

472
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,434
 

473
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,314
Give me a minute.

474
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,794
It's all right.

475
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:46,174
Answer it right here.

476
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,934
 

477
00:40:02,964 --> 00:40:05,714
  The call is not going through. 
You'll be connected to the voicemail.  

478
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:19,164
 

479
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:22,034
Yes, Jin Ho.

480
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:27,304
Let's talk later. I'm with
 Jung Sun right now.

481
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,764
Let me say hi...

482
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,444
to Mr. Cha.

483
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,804
Hello?

484
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:06,534
 Jung Sun. 

485
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,584
You've been good, right?

486
00:41:11,974 --> 00:41:13,724
Yes.

487
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:16,474
You're good, too, right?

488
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,684
I heard you went to China.

489
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,824
I got back last night.

490
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:22,574
I see.

491
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:24,914
 I'm sorry for harassing 
Hyung after work hours. 

492
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:28,334
I was crazed in the afternoon doing
 follow-up work after my business trip.

493
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:29,624
It's all right.

494
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:31,414
Let's have dinner soon.

495
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:34,604
Okay, goodnight.

496
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:53,714
What's wrong with me? Seriously...

497
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:02,624
Honey, are you cheating on me?

498
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,874
This is ridiculous, right?

499
00:42:57,004 --> 00:43:00,294
Gosh, really. Why am I the 
green-eyed monster?

500
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:03,534
All because of a strange 
joke of a text.

501
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:06,264
A text?

502
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,154
It's nothing.

503
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,984
I'm tired. I'll go wash up.

504
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:31,734
 Honey, are you cheating on me? 

505
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:12,534
 Yes, Hyung. 

506
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:14,174
Thanks.

507
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:19,484
I did it since you asked me to.

508
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:21,784
But I don't know if I did
 the right thing.

509
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:24,794
Okay, goodnight.

510
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:36,464
I asked the PR Team for help.

511
00:44:36,464 --> 00:44:38,244
Is Assistant Manager Cha in charge?

512
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:41,164
Actually, Mr. Cha is on
 a business trip to China.

513
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:43,294
Manager Song is in charge.

514
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:42,134
 

515
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:44,734
 

516
00:47:50,594 --> 00:47:52,984
 Honey, are you cheating on me? 

517
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:18,624
 Can we meet today? 

518
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,144
 I have something to tell you. 

519
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:46,134
Yes, this is Ma Sang Woo from the
 VIP Management Team.

520
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:47,594
Yes.

521
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:50,024
Yes, sir. Will do.

522
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:54,114
Vice President is calling 
for a team dinner.

523
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:10,524
All right.

524
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:13,284
You're all doing a great job.

525
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:17,174
I wanted this gathering to encourage
 everyone to stay strong.

526
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:20,564
At least for today, be jolly
 and drink to your fill.

527
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:21,994
Okay, short and sweet.

528
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:24,314
- To Sung Un!
 - Sung Un! 

529
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:48,684
Is everyone eating a lot?

530
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:59,394
Is the work going well for you?

531
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:03,944
Yes.

532
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:10,364
I know our Management Team
 works very hard.

533
00:50:10,364 --> 00:50:12,694
But let's keep striving.

534
00:50:12,694 --> 00:50:15,964
I promise you'll be well 
rewarded for your hard work.

535
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:18,194
Here.

536
00:50:52,204 --> 00:50:55,164
- Please excuse me for a minute.
- All right.

537
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:05,124
 Okay, then. Enjoy. 

538
00:51:21,854 --> 00:51:24,464
 I'll see you afterward. 

539
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:33,854
- The Vice President earlier...
- Yes.

540
00:51:33,854 --> 00:51:34,864
Did you see it?

541
00:51:34,864 --> 00:51:36,334
Yes, I did.

542
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,374
- He's so blatant. Too much, huh?
- I know.

543
00:51:39,374 --> 00:51:41,164
Is her name On Yoo Ri?

544
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,614
She doesn't look like the type.

545
00:51:42,614 --> 00:51:45,684
But you can't judge 
a book by its cover, huh?

546
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:49,894
They say the nice girls 
are naughty inside.

547
00:51:49,894 --> 00:51:54,194
You're surrounded by co-workers, yet 
you're gossiping in the restroom...

548
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,544
Are you doing so
 people will hear you?

549
00:51:56,544 --> 00:51:58,514
We were just...

550
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:01,464
Stating unconfirmed 
rumors as if they're true

551
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:04,934
and telling everyone. 
You should be careful.

552
00:52:04,934 --> 00:52:09,484
What will you do if the 
Vice President hears about it?

553
00:52:09,484 --> 00:52:11,954
Manager Lee, our apologies.

554
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:23,974
I think you can come out now.

555
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:35,264
Did you commit a crime?

556
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:37,284
Why didn't you come out?

557
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:40,984
Thank you.

558
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:43,204
No need to thank me.

559
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:45,904
I'm one of the gossipers, too.

560
00:52:47,944 --> 00:52:51,604
I have no interest 
in your personal life,

561
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,134
but still.

562
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:55,734
You should be cautious 
of workplace gossip.

563
00:52:58,324 --> 00:53:00,904
Geez, I sound like an old fogy.

564
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:03,174
I'll get going then.

565
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:18,344
Ms. Na.

566
00:53:25,134 --> 00:53:26,064
Here.

567
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:29,454
Thank you.

568
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:39,364
Why did you drink so much?

569
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:42,384
You usually don't drink much.

570
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:45,674
Mi Na.

571
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,334
Do you ever get like this?

572
00:53:53,704 --> 00:53:57,284
Someone I thought I knew well...

573
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:01,984
seems like a stranger 
all of a sudden.

574
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:08,444
I'm not sure.

575
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:12,894
I guess I must be drunk.

576
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,784
My drunken behavior is coming out.

577
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:20,784
Perhaps it's wrong...

578
00:54:20,784 --> 00:54:25,534
to think I know someone 
very well in the first place?

579
00:54:28,594 --> 00:54:30,384
We're probably...

580
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:35,844
under the illusion that the portion 
shown by someone is their entirety.

581
00:54:38,844 --> 00:54:43,574
Everyone has a secret which 
they don't show anyone.

582
00:54:45,234 --> 00:54:46,444
Is that so?

583
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:49,474
Ms. Na, you're not like that?

584
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:57,114
Ms. Na, Sunbaenim.

585
00:54:57,114 --> 00:54:59,944
- We're wrapping it up.
- Okay.

586
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:01,784
Let's go inside.

587
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,624
I'll drop off Vice President
 before heading home.

588
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:11,104
You go ahead.

589
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:13,344
Don't overdo it.

590
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:15,134
I'm leaving.

591
00:55:26,644 --> 00:55:28,114
Ahjussi.

592
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:31,424
I'm sorry, but can 
we please go back?

593
00:55:39,144 --> 00:55:41,094
Yes. Great job.

594
00:55:41,094 --> 00:55:42,714
- I'll get going first.
- Yes, sir. Goodnight.

595
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:54,574
Team Leader.

596
00:55:54,574 --> 00:55:56,424
Let's go for a second round.

597
00:55:56,424 --> 00:55:58,944
I'm sorry. I have to go home.

598
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:12,534
Ahjussi.

599
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:15,164
Can you follow that taxi?

600
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:41,734
 

601
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,234
I'll get out.

602
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:22,634
You're probably better 
off not looking.

603
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:25,134
Once you do, you won't forget it.

604
00:58:02,234 --> 00:58:04,084
 Hello? 

605
00:58:04,084 --> 00:58:06,524
Honey, where are you?

606
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:09,344
 Vice President had
 too much to drink. 

607
00:58:09,344 --> 00:58:10,844
 I'm leaving soon. 

608
00:58:12,744 --> 00:58:15,724
So you're still with
 the Vice President?

609
00:58:17,224 --> 00:58:18,764
 Yeah. 

610
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:20,234
 Well... 

611
00:58:20,234 --> 00:58:22,834
 things are under control now. 

612
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:25,474
 You must be tired. 
Go ahead and sleep. 

613
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:52,964
♫  When the sun's down  ♫

614
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:55,554
 

615
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:58,084
♫  As the time goes by  ♫

616
00:58:58,084 --> 00:59:05,254
♫  Soon the truth becomes 
such a lie again  ♫

617
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:12,474
♫  I'm wasting my time
 seizing for the truth  ♫

618
00:59:12,474 --> 00:59:14,704
 I used to think this way once. 

619
00:59:14,704 --> 00:59:16,704
 Enough to fill in the 
shattered cracks... 

620
00:59:16,704 --> 00:59:18,324
 That my love was special. 

621
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:20,454
 - Explain this situation to me.
- Jung Sun... 

622
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:23,794
 Why do all my loved 
ones leave me? 

623
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:25,834
 You must really want a promotion. 

624
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:27,734
 I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving. 

625
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:28,934
 I'll be attending the big meeting. 

626
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:30,264
 Isn't the meeting tomorrow? 

627
00:59:30,264 --> 00:59:31,534
 Is it someone I know? 

628
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,784
 It was like an accident. 

629
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:36,334
 I'm scared of losing him. 

630
00:59:36,394 --> 00:59:38,424
 Could you give me 
one more chance? 

631
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:40,164
 I can't lose you like this. 

632
00:59:46,944 --> 00:59:48,794
♫  Nothing can...  ♫
