1
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:37,801
 

2
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,101
I'm home.

3
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:42,281
- You're home.
- Yeah.

4
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:43,781
It's so hot.

5
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:46,891
Aigoo, I see.

6
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,381
What are you doing? 
Get away from me.

7
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,031
I don't want to.

8
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,221
- But it's hot.
- Fine.

9
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,321
Geez, seriously.

10
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,961
It's okay. You're tired.

11
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,901
Aigoo, not tired at all.

12
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:03,561
I'm doing it for my daughter.

13
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,421
My daughter, you didn't
 luck out with your mom.

14
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:10,091
You're suffering in a house without 
an air-conditioner in this hot summer.

15
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,611
Between living without you 
with an air-conditioner,

16
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:15,411
or living in a rooftop room 
with you? I choose the rooftop.

17
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,901
- Really?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,711
Then let's stay here until 
the end of eternity

19
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,831
and have a good life.

20
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,611
Geez, what gives? I'm hot.

21
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,831
Let go of me.

22
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,471
Where are the things 
you're discarding?

23
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,351
- Right this way.
- Okay.

24
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,421
All of these things?

25
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,231
Yes.

26
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,091
- Take them out.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,351
All right.

28
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,001
Wait...

29
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,801
I'll keep this.

30
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,801
Okay.

31
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:11,261
 

32
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,001
You should rest some more.

33
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,931
My thoughts keep
 running if I'm alone.

34
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,691
I'll get off here and walk.

35
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,211
It won't be good if people see us.

36
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:41,941
Wait.

37
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,101
Take this.

38
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,101
Did the funeral go okay?

39
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,511
Yes.

40
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,901
My name is Ha Tae Young.

41
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:07,151
I'm here because the 
Chairman scouted me.

42
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:10,251
I'll lead Sung Un, not as
 the owner's daughter,

43
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,171
but as a professional 
businesswoman.

44
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:28,521
She has showcased her abilities
 outside of our company.

45
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,571
Let's all have faith in 
President Ha Tae Young

46
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,231
and support her.

47
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,891
Hello.

48
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,811
Jae Woong.

49
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,091
Long time no see.

50
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:45,081
When did you come back to Korea?

51
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,791
Isn't this quite a surprise?

52
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:50,891
Sr. Managing Director Choi, 
Father spoke highly of you.

53
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,941
I'll do my best to assist you.

54
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,841
- I'm Managing Director Park.
- Nice to be working with you.

55
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:55,921
Director Heo?

56
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,611
I've heard great things about you.

57
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:00,161
- Hello, I'm Director Park Young Moo.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

58
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,391
Please come to my office 
some time. Let's have coffee.

59
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,041
Let's get going.

60
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,191
What's going on?

61
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,781
I thought you were the 
VP's right-hand man.

62
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:27,201
Now your wife is getting transferred.

63
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,561
Transferred?

64
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,911
You didn't know?

65
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:35,621
My apologies. Please excuse me.

66
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:44,451
Is it true you assigned 
Ms. Na to the Ulsan branch?

67
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,551
Ms. Na is the victim in all this.

68
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,271
Please revoke the transfer.

69
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,381
 Can I help you? You can't go in there! 

70
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,211
You may leave.

71
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,861
What's the matter?

72
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:12,681
I was told you assigned me to 
the Ulsan branch, Vice President.

73
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:17,231
You're crossing the line.

74
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:21,671
It's not your place to meddle in 
personnel assignments, Ms. Na.

75
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:22,831
Yes.

76
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,781
I'm well aware of that.

77
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:28,001
However, if this transfer is

78
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,591
due to Director Park Sung Joon
 and On Yoo Ri's infidelity,

79
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,051
I'm here to make a statement.

80
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:36,651
If this transfer is...

81
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,701
assigned to cover up
 their infidelity at my cost,

82
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:45,831
I will not sit back and watch.

83
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,511
I'll expose everything publicly.

84
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:55,101
If so, you'll suffer 
the consequences, too.

85
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,271
I've already lost too much.

86
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:01,701
I have nothing to lose 
nor be afraid of.

87
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:03,821
What's for certain is that

88
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:07,051
if the truth gets exposed,

89
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,181
you'll be the one...

90
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,081
who suffers the most 
significant loss.

91
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,011
Are you threatening me right now?

92
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,341
No, sir.

93
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,071
I'm protecting myself.

94
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,001
Please consider that 
when making your decision.

95
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,101
I chose you.

96
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,471
All choices come
 with consequences.

97
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:58,311
Shouldn't you make 
your choice as well?

98
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,331
I recorded the TifÃ³ne
 event video clip.

99
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,861
Was it Director Bae's order?

100
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,141
I had no idea it'd be 
used for that purpose.

101
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:37,251
I knew it was wrong 
from the get-go...

102
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:41,001
I shouldn't have done it at the time.

103
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,051
Yesterday...

104
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,601
I went to see Director Bae.

105
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,871
But...

106
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:04,601
Director Bae...

107
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:10,811
The Management Team?

108
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:11,911
Yes.

109
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,441
We can say it's our 
company's core department.

110
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,541
The Vice President used to
 have full control over it.

111
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,711
When its former team leader
 Mr. Park was promoted a director,

112
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,811
the team leader position 
became vacant.

113
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,661
Director Park...

114
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,751
You mean Park Sung Joon, correct?

115
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:30,221
- Jae Woong's right-hand man.
- Yes.

116
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:34,581
However, things between them
 don't seem well these days.

117
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:39,841
I think something happened 
between those two.

118
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,251
I'm curious as to what.

119
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,781
I'll look into it.

120
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:30,891
 

121
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,881
We've been friends for 
ten years already.

122
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:36,891
Time sure flies.

123
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:40,521
Back then...

124
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:43,381
who knew we'd end up like
 this ten years later.

125
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:44,831
I hear you.

126
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:51,561
How are you holding up?

127
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:55,181
You have to keep 
seeing him at work.

128
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,851
It's difficult, huh?

129
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,951
I think they're seeing 
each other again.

130
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:09,701
Those crazy jerks...

131
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,621
When I've been ruined like this,

132
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:22,111
could they be happy?

133
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,961
I want them all ruined, too.

134
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,841
You said you have something to say.

135
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,981
Go ahead.

136
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,451
Is something the matter?

137
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,651
Jung Sun.

138
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:59,651
Lee Young Joon, Lee Seo Joon!

139
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,221
If you don't clean this
 up now, no dinner!

140
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,271
Honey.

141
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,171
I set the table. Let's go eat.

142
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,341
We should starve them for a day

143
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:15,411
to bring down their 
energy level to normal.

144
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,121
Let us eat, okay?

145
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:18,571
Let's eat by ourselves.

146
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:25,771
They say a disease 
that's incurable by food

147
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,451
isn't curable by medicine, either.

148
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,071
This is totally healthy.

149
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,271
Yes!

150
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,601
Enjoy.

151
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:53,091
It's delicious.

152
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,301
Honey, I think I have 
a knack for cooking.

153
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,471
Had I known sooner,

154
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:02,631
I would've become a star chef
 and made a killing.

155
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:12,951
Let's eat.

156
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,581
It's nice...

157
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,961
eating with you at home, Honey.

158
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,481
So...

159
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:42,041
what will you do about Director Bae?

160
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,101
 

161
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,801
 

162
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:29,301
 

163
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,201
 

164
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,271
This post went up last night
 on our message board.

165
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,701
 I'm the victim of Sung Un 
Department Store's 

166
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,471
 Director Bae Do Il's attempted rape. 

167
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,011
 I'm Manager Lee Hyun Ah
 from Sung Un Department Store's 

168
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,191
 VIP Management Team. 

169
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:37,391
 A year ago, on the 
evening of July 18th, 

170
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,031
 Director Bae Doo Il... 

171
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:42,241
 attempted to rape me 
at Shinhwa Hotel. 

172
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,381
 At the time, 

173
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:48,051
 I was only focused on winning. 

174
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,801
Can you handle a drink?
 

175
00:17:51,801 --> 00:17:55,431
I can hold my alcohol 
just about anywhere.

176
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,031
Is that right?

177
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,861
This way, I can keep up 
with you gentlemen.

178
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,011
You're no frills. I like that.

179
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,461
Thank you.

180
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:25,861
I wouldn't bring just anyone to our side,
 Sr. Managing Director Ha.

181
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:56,961
 I thought things were going well. 

182
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,201
 Until that incident. 

183
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,661
Yes, Director Bae. Where are you?

184
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,031
I brought the documents 
per your request.

185
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,161
Yes, sir. Will do.

186
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,931
Director Bae, the documents.

187
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,941
But where is the vendor...

188
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:26,141
Oh.

189
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:29,061
I figured our document 
review would take a while,

190
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,901
so I decided to see him next time.

191
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:32,461
Have a seat.

192
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:34,431
Yes, sir.

193
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,471
Actually, I drove here today.

194
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,561
We'll call for a designated driver.

195
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,501
It's all right.

196
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,091
You must be tired from
 today's meetings.

197
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,681
I'll get going then.

198
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:01,301
What gives?

199
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,231
I know your deal.

200
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,921
Director Bae.

201
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,061
I think there's a misunderstanding...

202
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,351
Come on now.
 What misunderstanding?

203
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:13,691
You came all the way here
 just to back out?

204
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:18,691
You want this, too. Why be coy?

205
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,801
Stop.

206
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,901
Don't do this.

207
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:22,901
Director Bae.

208
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,201
- Stop it.
- Why should I?

209
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,301
- What's with you?
- I said, stop!

210
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:43,341
Man, s***!

211
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,601
Hey, you...

212
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,001
S***...

213
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,531
 I tried to report Director Bae
 after that incident, 

214
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,301
 but I was afraid. 

215
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,801
 So in the end... 

216
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,741
 I chose to run away. 

217
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:36,301
 The reason I'm revealing
 this a year later is 

218
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,001
 because I found out that there is 

219
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,801
 another sexual harassment 
victim by Director Bae. 

220
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:45,311
 The past year... 

221
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,891
 was hellish for me. 

222
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,891
 I'm sure the other
 victim felt the same. 

223
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:58,601
 I can no longer keep silence 
seeing another victim arise, 

224
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,581
 so I'm exposing this incident. 

225
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:04,461
What is this?

226
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:07,671
What's going on?

227
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,291
Did you know about this?

228
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,531
Hey, Lee Hyun Ah...

229
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:17,001
How could you endure this alone...

230
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,301
Why are you crying?

231
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,131
I had no idea...

232
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,811
What will you do?

233
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:49,251
It's not true.

234
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:50,881
She approached me 
for a promotion

235
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,021
and is taking revenge 
because she lost out.

236
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,021
You know of the current situation!

237
00:22:55,021 --> 00:22:57,591
How can we get involved
 in such a scandal?

238
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,351
I'll take care of it.

239
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,741
I'll reveal that it's a conspiracy,

240
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,631
and prove my innocence.

241
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,971
Please give me time.

242
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:34,201
It's okay...

243
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:51,011
The post went viral on an informational
 blog shared within our industry

244
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:52,261
and even reported on the news.

245
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,751
Isn't it a one-sided claim?

246
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,201
Who knows if it was revenge 
for losing out on a promotion?

247
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:01,561
Regardless of whose fault, we should
 figure out the details ASAP

248
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:02,971
and make our statement.

249
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:05,031
That would alleviate the
 damage on our part.

250
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:07,061
Putting out the fire in a rush

251
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,441
could lead to a bigger fire.

252
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:13,081
Let's monitor the situation for now.

253
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,131
We'll adjourn the meeting.

254
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,231
Oh, Director Park.

255
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,101
Come see me in my office.

256
00:24:23,101 --> 00:24:24,011
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,971
A year ago...

258
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:33,281
Manager Lee Hyun Ah 
turned in her resignation,

259
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:37,721
but I heard that you processed
 it as a leave of absence.

260
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:40,261
Were you aware of this
 incident, Director Park?

261
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,551
Yes.

262
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:45,051
Did you stop 
Manager Lee at the time?

263
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,461
To keep it quiet?

264
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:49,581
At the time, Manager Lee 
didn't want to make it public.

265
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,541
Director Park, why don't you 
meet with Manager Lee?

266
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,791
The press is on it already.

267
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,051
It's a big headache from
 the company's standpoint.

268
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:07,221
Since you have a personal
 relationship with Ms. Lee,

269
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:11,161
please convince her to 
keep things from escalating.

270
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:17,651
For Manager Lee Hyun Ah
 to make this decision...

271
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,191
it required a lot of courage.

272
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:25,371
I think I should support and 
observe her decision for now.

273
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:27,151
My apologies.

274
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:33,791
As a member of our executive team, 
shouldn't you side with...

275
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:36,321
the company rather 
than an individual?

276
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:38,641
It's best to sort out...

277
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:41,951
the rotten apple for the 
good of the company.

278
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:46,221
Covering up and ignoring it won't 
make the problem disappear.

279
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,741
I'm sure you can back up
 your decision, correct?

280
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,471
Report back to me regarding the

281
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:53,981
progress of your decision.

282
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:57,681
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,821
 According to Vice 
President's chauffeur, 

284
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,601
 there seems to be 
something going on between  

285
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,651
 Director Park and the
 VP's daughter On Yoo Ri. 

286
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,411
- Team Leader, by the way...
- Yes.

287
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,501
Did you see Lee Hyun Ah's 
old pics online?

288
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:56,971
Old pictures?

289
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:01,081
 I'm her college classmate. 

290
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,151
 Manager Lee Hyun Ah was 
boy crazy even in her college days. 

291
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:07,261
 I heard this was revenge for
 losing out on a promotion. 

292
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,811
 - Not surprising. 
- Geez, really...

293
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,231
I knew it.

294
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,411
Director Bae really 
stepped in it, you know.

295
00:27:15,411 --> 00:27:17,741
As you know, it takes two to tango.

296
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,831
He couldn't have done
 it alone. Seriously...

297
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:23,271
Aigoo, what is the world coming to?

298
00:27:23,271 --> 00:27:27,191
I'm scared to even talk to 
the female employees now.

299
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:30,491
When I give orders to female 
employees from now on,

300
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:32,901
I'll just write it down
 on paper. Aigoo...

301
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:40,441
Hey, Manager Lee.

302
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,791
Don't you have any manners?

303
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,431
When you see your superior,
 you should say hi.

304
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:53,231
I didn't think you saw me, 
Team Leader Kim.

305
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,851
My apologies.

306
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,801
You see that? She's so rude.

307
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,591
- Manager Lee, are you okay...
- I'm fine.

308
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:35,831
Yes.

309
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:40,021
Let's make it a series 
and post some more.

310
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:42,271
 

311
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:53,721
 

312
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:55,971
 I'll wait for you by the intersection. 

313
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:33,608
Get in.

314
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,938
The Chairman wants to see you.

315
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:54,858
It's an important meeting. 
You mustn't make any mistakes.

316
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:26,168
 The customer is not 
answering the phone... 

317
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:58,428
Are you looking for her?

318
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,018
How long has it been?

319
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:17,788
It's been three years.

320
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:26,558
Yes.

321
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:28,768
We're family now.

322
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,938
I summoned her so 
we can say hello.

323
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:32,318
Have a seat.

324
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:46,638
Let's eat.

325
00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:55,418
The company is in an uproar.

326
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:57,418
She's got many men to begin with,

327
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:59,548
and is a troublemaker.

328
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:02,618
Poor Director Bae is wronged.

329
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:05,328
It's a sensitive topic that public 
opinions can turn the tide.

330
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:07,248
We should be cautious
 with our response.

331
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:09,288
I'll take care of it.

332
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:12,508
Tae Young, I trust you'll 
take care of it.

333
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,568
Yes. Please don't worry.

334
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:20,158
Oh, right. I heard...

335
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:22,958
you suffered a loss recently.

336
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,088
I'm sorry.

337
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:31,348
This is a family dinner. 
Eat comfortably.

338
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,098
Yes, Chairman.

339
00:32:34,098 --> 00:32:38,028
I was worried because
 you didn't have any kids.

340
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:40,438
I'm relieved now.

341
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:45,508
I told Attorney Choi to put
 her on the family registrar.

342
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:47,008
Father.

343
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,568
Why rush like that...

344
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,908
She's a Ha bloodline.

345
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:51,818
Why the delay?

346
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,068
I know she came along a bit late,

347
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:56,268
but treat her as your own.

348
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,568
Yes, Father.

349
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:01,728
Eat.

350
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:28,768
You're recognized as 
a Ha family member now.

351
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:32,068
You should be tidy and look
 the part of my daughter.

352
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:34,348
In your behavior and whatnot.

353
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:39,988
Otherwise, you'll hear, 
"Like mother, like daughter." Right?

354
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,618
 

355
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:02,138
I met all the victims 
on Byung Hoon's list,

356
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:04,408
even the ones who have resigned.

357
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:10,268
 

358
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:17,218
 

359
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,968
 

360
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,648
We humbly ask of you.

361
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:41,028
 

362
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:48,888
Four of them will join our cause.

363
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:51,528
Five, including me.

364
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,168
If this goes to court,
 it'll be extremely tough on you.

365
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:01,878
I knew what I was getting into.

366
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,718
Hello?

367
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:11,088
 Is this Manager Lee Hyun Ah? 

368
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:12,698
Yes, it is.

369
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:14,908
 This is Jung In Young 
from the HR Department. 

370
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:20,538
Acknowledgment and 
an official apology.

371
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,828
If we comply...

372
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:28,338
won't it tarnish our 
corporate image?

373
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:30,918
This isn't just about an individual.

374
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,928
It concerns our company policy.

375
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:34,538
If we conduct an investigation and

376
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:36,658
reconfigure our sexual 
harassment prevention protocol

377
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:39,478
to show we're changing 
our corporate culture,

378
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,678
the customers will be convinced of

379
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:44,028
our improved corporate image.

380
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:45,788
I'll review it.

381
00:35:48,548 --> 00:35:50,008
And also...

382
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:55,268
I want to ask you 
something personal.

383
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Director Park.

384
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,108
Won't you be on my side?

385
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:19,548
I know you and Jae Woong 
used to be quite close.

386
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:22,688
Therefore, I really 
want you on my side.

387
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:30,778
I saw the post.

388
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,718
It's tough, huh?

389
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:34,888
I'm all right.

390
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,788
It's common with these 
types of incidents.

391
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:42,228
From the organization's standpoint, 
it's easier to blame the woman.

392
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:45,078
It's like throwing eggs
 against a rock.

393
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,338
I'm aware of that.

394
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,938
I'm sure you blew this 
issue up because

395
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,958
you thought it would be
 advantageous to you.

396
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:55,238
But truthfully, it's a 
double-edged sword.

397
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:59,668
Things could get even more 
unbearable for you, Ms. Lee.

398
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,138
Like today.

399
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,818
The Myongil employee who
 joined the MeToo movement

400
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:05,688
ended up suffering a backlash,

401
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:07,818
and resigned recently.

402
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:11,718
If you post an explanation
 at this point,

403
00:37:11,718 --> 00:37:16,388
the company will make sure you 
won't suffer any backlash, Ms. Lee.

404
00:37:16,388 --> 00:37:20,658
People will quiet down after
 some gossiping anyway.

405
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:22,838
Won't that be better?

406
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,168
 

407
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:59,468
Geez, what crazy bastard sent 
an email to the entire staff?

408
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:16,568
 That day... 

409
00:38:16,568 --> 00:38:19,568
you summoned me to the 
hotel and tried to rape me.

410
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:22,968
Go ahead and tell them that.

411
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:25,788
Then I'll say...

412
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:29,078
you approached me for 
a promotion, Ms. Lee.

413
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:34,998
Who do you think they'll believe?

414
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:38,138
People will believe those in power.

415
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,718
Isn't it a typical occurrence
 after drinking?

416
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:47,158
I was overly affectionate to
 a subordinate employee.

417
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,988
Since you're painting it this way...

418
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,108
I'm flustered as well.

419
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:01,378
I'll let it slide once, but

420
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:03,738
if you do this again,

421
00:39:03,738 --> 00:39:06,638
I won't be able to trust 
you anymore, Ms. Lee.

422
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,608
 Being a whistleblower 
in an organization 

423
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:17,398
 and a victim of a sexual assault... 

424
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,608
 was not bearable 
solely on my resolve. 

425
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,028
 But the hardest part of all was 

426
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:27,208
 facing the fear inside me. 

427
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,268
 Each time the fear crept in, 

428
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:32,598
 I thought of the past year 
that I lived in hiding. 

429
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:35,708
 If I'd hidden away forever, 

430
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,228
 I would've really destroyed myself. 

431
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:40,768
 Therefore... 

432
00:39:40,768 --> 00:39:42,968
 
  I have no plans of ever stepping back. 

433
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,838
 I want many people 
to know about this  

434
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:49,568
 and have an open discussion
 about the issue. 

435
00:39:49,568 --> 00:39:52,918
 Only then, we'll bring 
about small changes. 

436
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:57,528
 Regretfully, there were 
many victims besides me, 

437
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:01,968
 and a few of them joined me
 in reporting this incident. 

438
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:06,548
 Regardless, I hope there will not be  

439
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:08,858
 any more victims going forward. 

440
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:12,788
You b****, how dare you...

441
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,098
B****, how dare you!

442
00:40:30,478 --> 00:40:32,008
I filed a complaint.

443
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:33,748
I should've given it to you sooner.

444
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:36,828
- But I finally got around to it.
- It's no use.

445
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:39,778
- I won't die.
- You shouldn't.

446
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:44,048
You should live on and 
pay for your crimes.

447
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,528
I did the right thing, right?

448
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:20,058
This is Na Jung Sun.

449
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:35,668
You made an impression that day.

450
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,188
However, you didn't 
get the desired results.

451
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:43,928
As you saw from the
 transfer assignment,

452
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:46,358
if you're enemies with Director Park,

453
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:48,888
you'll be enemies with
 VP Ha as well.

454
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,298
It's a bit strange, isn't it?

455
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:56,048
Why won't he...

456
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:59,168
discard Director Park, who had
 a scandalous relationship

457
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,868
with his daughter...

458
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:04,468
and strike you instead?

459
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,718
Because he favors him?

460
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:09,728
What are you trying to say...

461
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:15,818
That man will not let 
go of Director Park.

462
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:19,938
Those two are quite
 bonded, so to speak.

463
00:42:23,158 --> 00:42:24,258
I should get going.

464
00:42:24,258 --> 00:42:27,438
Why would you tell me 
something like this?

465
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:34,838
I'm also in a bind these days,
 in more ways than one.

466
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:40,488
It occurred to me that 
I want to torment him.

467
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,388
Consider this a gift.

468
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:55,368
I revoked Ms. Na's transfer.

469
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:58,958
Regarding that, I'll comply
 with your wishes.

470
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:06,868
My older sister wants to
 bring you in her circle, huh?

471
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:12,378
Father...

472
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:18,128
never considered her as a successor 
because she's a daughter.

473
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,228
The reason he made 
her the president...

474
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,368
is his way of warning me.

475
00:43:25,368 --> 00:43:29,838
But knowing my sister, 
given this opportunity...

476
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,088
she will not want to back down.

477
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:35,528
I'll be honest here.

478
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:38,638
Literally a war inside and 
outside the family.

479
00:43:43,518 --> 00:43:44,868
I need you.

480
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:48,418
What happened with Yoo Ri...

481
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,418
is in the past, right?

482
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,168
I have something to tell you.

483
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,978
I plan on being by On Yoo Ri's side.

484
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:10,308
My apologies.

485
00:44:10,308 --> 00:44:13,928
At this moment,
 my choice to be with her.

486
00:44:17,398 --> 00:44:19,218
I understand.

487
00:44:19,218 --> 00:44:22,398
I won't oppose your relationship.

488
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:24,238
But under one condition.

489
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:26,578
See her only if...

490
00:44:26,578 --> 00:44:29,518
the divorce is finalized 
and cleared up.

491
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:33,318
Yoo Ri has already been 
exposed to the media.

492
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,098
If infidelity becomes an issue, 
it'll be fatal for her.

493
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:40,888
You have that much 
common sense, right?

494
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:46,228
Since I've given you my 
answer about that issue,

495
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:49,318
now it's your turn to answer me.

496
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,058
I went to your office a few times.

497
00:45:28,608 --> 00:45:30,248
I did, but...

498
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,428
I didn't know what to say.

499
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:41,018
Hyun Ah.

500
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:43,978
I'm sorry.

501
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:49,268
You saying no to me...

502
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:52,668
I took it lightly...

503
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:57,478
and I felt bad about 
taking it as a joke.

504
00:45:57,478 --> 00:45:58,758
I'm truly sorry.

505
00:46:09,178 --> 00:46:11,878
I just wanted to support
 you. I mean it.

506
00:46:19,728 --> 00:46:21,238
Thank you.

507
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,308
Aigoo, what a display of 
occupational disease.

508
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:48,958
It's pretty, huh?

509
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:51,888
Clean it up before you go. 
Or else, you're dead.

510
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:53,608
If we leave it, you'll make use of it.

511
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:55,338
Hey, I have no room for it.

512
00:46:55,338 --> 00:46:57,228
 Cheers! 

513
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:59,558
Geez, why drink a soda
 on a day like today?

514
00:46:59,558 --> 00:47:00,938
You should be drinking with us.

515
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:03,758
- It's because I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant?

516
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:06,538
What on earth? Am I the 
only one in the dark?

517
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:10,708
You were amazing.

518
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,938
You, too.

519
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:15,418
But this won't be the end.

520
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:19,078
Life sure is hard, huh?

521
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:20,758
Life is like that.

522
00:47:20,758 --> 00:47:22,988
You never know what will happen.

523
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:26,798
I didn't know I'd get 
divorced, either.

524
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:31,088
A divorce?

525
00:47:32,288 --> 00:47:34,498
What the? I was in the dark again?

526
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:38,278
Is it Byung Hoon?

527
00:47:38,278 --> 00:47:40,268
Answer it.

528
00:47:42,648 --> 00:47:44,908
- Hey.
- Wait a sec.

529
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,328
I'm on the phone...

530
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:47,388
Honey.

531
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:48,698
 When are you coming home? 

532
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,528
Mi Na is not going home tonight.

533
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:52,118
Yes, hello. Say hello!

534
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:54,548
 - Hello!
- Say hi, Young Joon. 

535
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:56,168
Hello!

536
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:57,888
Okay, really...

537
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:00,558
Seriously, I'm fine.

538
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:02,208
Have a good time.

539
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,088
 I'm totally fine, it's the kids... 

540
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:05,378
 They're acting up suddenly. 

541
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:07,878
 And Manager Lee! Great job today. 

542
00:48:07,878 --> 00:48:09,768
You know I played my part, right?

543
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:11,938
 Director Bae used the
 company's messenger 

544
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,868
 to send sexual comments
 to the victims. 

545
00:48:13,868 --> 00:48:14,978
 I found every one of them... 

546
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,608
- I know...
- I'm on the phone here. Wait a sec.!

547
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:21,458
I'm sorry. Daddy's sorry.

548
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:24,068
Thank you, Assistant Manager Lee.

549
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,188
- Why are the kids still up?
- They won't sleep.

550
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:30,538
Honey, we should wean 
them off the red ginseng.

551
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:33,118
Look at the time, yet they're 
still going strong.

552
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,448
 We should think about that. 

553
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:40,108
Assistant Manager Lee, we'll 
enjoy ourselves here then.

554
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:41,648
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:48:41,648 --> 00:48:43,808
 But today... 

556
00:48:46,228 --> 00:48:50,008
I didn't know I'd get to
 raise three kids, either.

557
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:52,018
Actually, make that four.

558
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,268
So what happened?

559
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:00,648
 - Let's do a cheers.
- Cheers. 

560
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,498
Really, you guys...

561
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:04,748
I'm sad, seriously.

562
00:49:10,508 --> 00:49:12,868
Sorry for the 
misunderstanding back then.

563
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:16,178
I even sent you that text.

564
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:20,198
I think I owe you an apology.

565
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,758
It's all right.

566
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:26,038
But I was a bit startled that

567
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:29,218
you'd send that anonymous text.

568
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,538
Because I received a strange text.

569
00:49:33,188 --> 00:49:36,728
Someone sent me a text saying, 
his woman is on our team.

570
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:38,698
I must've been crazy.

571
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,858
Even though that text 
turned out to be true.

572
00:49:43,968 --> 00:49:46,778
 What are you doing? Come outside! 

573
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,588
I'll take these first.

574
00:49:48,588 --> 00:49:51,378
I'll wash the rest and bring them.

575
00:50:09,198 --> 00:50:10,648
 

576
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:50,668
I'm off. Congrats, congrats.

577
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:53,778
Hello!

578
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:54,868
Yes.

579
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:56,068
Bye.

580
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:01,568
Love you. I love you!

581
00:51:03,788 --> 00:51:05,598
Mine is lagging.

582
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:09,438
Ms. Na.

583
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:14,768
The text you received that night...

584
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:27,268
Would you like to come in?

585
00:51:36,028 --> 00:51:37,308
Actually...

586
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:41,188
I have a question for you.

587
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:46,058
That day.

588
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:49,168
The first time we saw each 
other after our breakup.

589
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:52,368
My first day in the office?

590
00:51:53,638 --> 00:51:54,978
That day...

591
00:51:56,668 --> 00:51:58,268
why did you do that?

592
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:54,548
I haven't seen you in a month.

593
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,168
Yoo Ri.

594
00:52:58,268 --> 00:53:01,068
- We...
- I know that...

595
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,378
it's over for us.

596
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:09,468
But...

597
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:13,498
I'll be seeing you every day.

598
00:53:14,948 --> 00:53:17,918
Would you be okay, Sung Joon?

599
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:19,838
Would you?

600
00:53:25,428 --> 00:53:26,798
I must.

601
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,398
 

602
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:43,408
I'm having dinner with my wife. 
I have to go home.

603
00:53:47,788 --> 00:53:49,428
 Your mother is here. 

604
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,618
But you love me, Team Leader!

605
00:54:23,868 --> 00:54:25,068
We...

606
00:54:26,468 --> 00:54:28,768
still love each other.

607
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:52,358
 

608
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:26,898
Toward Dongjakgu, please.

609
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:51,968
 

610
00:58:00,888 --> 00:58:04,108
 

611
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:06,718
 

612
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:14,378
 

613
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:21,998
 

614
00:58:36,028 --> 00:58:37,698
 

615
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,538
It was On Yoo Ri?

616
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:17,208
Why did you send that 
text to Jung Sun?

617
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:26,198
 

618
00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:44,038
Where are you?

619
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,528
 

620
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:52,438
â«  Smile on your face  â«

621
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:59,398
â«  Could we ever turn back  â«

622
00:59:59,398 --> 01:00:03,058
â«  And I'll be shameless  â«

623
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:06,838
â«  Waiting for the day with you  â«

624
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:13,728
â«  I trust you in the darkness  â«

625
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:15,378
â«  What a shame on me  â«

626
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,788
 How dare you send 
me such a text? 

627
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:19,088
 - Jung Sun!
- Leave the team. 

628
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:21,058
 Don't stoop any lower 
and walk out. 

629
01:00:21,058 --> 01:00:22,968
 Manager Ha Yoo Ri? Since she's 
a Ha family member now. 

630
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:24,948
 Your father gave you 
the manager position. 

631
01:00:24,948 --> 01:00:26,518
 How will you claim that position? 

632
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:27,498
 
 It'll be hell for each other. 

633
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,398
 I told you. Let's go to hell together. 

634
01:00:29,398 --> 01:00:31,758
 It's better to be evil 
than just be naughty. 

635
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:33,688
 I know I'm a bad girl. 

636
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:35,878
 But please don't hate me... 

637
01:00:35,878 --> 01:00:39,228
â«  When I miss the 
smile on your face  â«

638
01:00:39,228 --> 01:00:41,058
â«  Could we ever turn back  â«
