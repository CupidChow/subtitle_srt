1
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:37,667
 

2
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,367
We waited a long time for this baby.

3
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,367
Coming to the hospital 
makes me nervous.

4
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,687
It's growing well.

5
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:46,147
She'll have to go to a public
 bathhouse with you.

6
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:48,457
Okay.

7
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,387
We have five months left. You're 
hanging the mobile already?

8
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:59,237
You sure are fussy, Sa Rang's dad.

9
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:06,147
There.

10
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:15,157
If she gets used to the 
sound from in there,

11
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:17,637
it won't be unfamiliar when she's out.

12
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,417
You're crazy about 
your daughter already.

13
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:22,457
A daughter?

14
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:24,707
It's a girl?

15
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,527
Sa Rang, you're a girl?

16
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:45,357
 Jung Sun. 

17
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:48,407
 Jung Sun, open the door. Jung Sun! 

18
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:53,857
 Please open the door, huh? 

19
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:56,077
 The fetus' heart stopped beating. 

20
00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:58,787
 We'll have to induce labor. 

21
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,177
 Jung Sun. 

22
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,557
 Jung Sun! 

23
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:13,727
You should rest more.

24
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:19,167
They say it happens a lot to 
older pregnant women.

25
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:22,007
You can have another one, right?

26
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,537
What are you saying here...

27
00:02:24,537 --> 00:02:26,467
Oh, Deputy GM Park.

28
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,867
I'm on my way to
 discuss next week's

29
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,577
golf tournament with PR Team's
 General Manager Lee.

30
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:33,097
Let's go together.

31
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:54,447
You should keep yourself
 warm. Drink this.

32
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:34,547
Jung Sun...

33
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,577
Everyone is saying...

34
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:41,877
that it'll be okay.

35
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,947
Really?

36
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:50,477
I came out of 13 hours of
 labor like other women

37
00:03:50,477 --> 00:03:52,697
yet I don't hear a baby's cries.

38
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:54,657
How would they know how I feel?

39
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:58,227
If I saw our baby's face, 
I don't think I'd ever forget.

40
00:03:59,787 --> 00:04:02,837
So I didn't see her face to the end.

41
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,757
I wanted to ask them.

42
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,627
"If this really happened to you,

43
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,227
would you be okay?"

44
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,787
Are you okay, Honey?

45
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:20,467
You should be going
 insane like me.

46
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:23,667
You should be enraged
 like me, right?

47
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,867
Why does it have to 
be our Sa Rang...

48
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,267
Why our baby?

49
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:38,187
I should've died instead, not her...

50
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,667
It's not okay...

51
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,507
 

52
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,467
You're home.
 

53
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:13,907
Jung Sun.

54
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,897
Come back to our room now.

55
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,237
You can't keep sleeping there.

56
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:26,337
Just let me be.

57
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,387
Going somewhere?

58
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,027
Someone I know...

59
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,797
passed away.

60
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,207
Want to...

61
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,477
go with me?

62
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,417
Is it someone I know?

63
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:05,707
No.

64
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,027
You're not feeling well. 
Get some rest.

65
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,947
I'll go by myself.

66
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:18,287
It's been over a year, but

67
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,077
it's not getting better at all.

68
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,887
I'm still hurting...

69
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,547
and I'm angry.

70
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,997
What are you angry about?

71
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,477
Everything.

72
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,477
I'm angry about everything.

73
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:38,907
I'm still going out of my mind...

74
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:44,427
but it's upsetting
 seeing him stay silent.

75
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,107
More than anything else,

76
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:50,377
I'm angry with myself.

77
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,917
Because I feel like 
I couldn't protect my baby.

78
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:04,957
I'm so angry with myself because 
everything seems like my fault.

79
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:07,037
Are you taking your medication?

80
00:08:09,507 --> 00:08:12,397
I've been on 
antidepressants for a year,

81
00:08:12,397 --> 00:08:13,947
but I feel the same.

82
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,527
Same old, same old.

83
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,877
Ahjussi, you were a psychiatrist.

84
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:25,627
Please tell me.

85
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,167
How can I...

86
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,227
live like a human again?

87
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:41,057
Things may not get better.

88
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:43,687
It may not get better at all

89
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:47,127
and you may have to bury
 it in your heart forever.

90
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,277
But a day will pass,

91
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,157
and the next...

92
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:53,517
then it'll be a year.

93
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:56,897
Life goes on.

94
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:59,367
Human life is resilient.

95
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,197
In the end, the living ones
 go on with their lives.

96
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:12,047
Sung Joon...

97
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,257
After you lost the baby, 
he said he'd

98
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:17,377
check your breathing for 
a few months while you slept.

99
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,747
At the time, to him...

100
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:24,937
Perhaps, the fear that something 
terrible would happen to you was

101
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,577
even bigger than the
 loss of his child.

102
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:31,527
Just because he's not 
saying anything

103
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:33,547
doesn't mean he's hurting less.

104
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,417
Some people just don't
 know how to express it.

105
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,867
I know...

106
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:44,737
how desperately you 
wanted to start a family.

107
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:49,077
If you could give up your life

108
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:52,107
and send that child into this world...

109
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,647
you would've done so gladly.

110
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,097
I know that.

111
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,777
However...

112
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,917
don't you have...

113
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,467
something left to protect?

114
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:14,727
You guys still have a chance.

115
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:22,337
I'll sleep here...

116
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:25,127
starting tonight.

117
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:28,927
We still...

118
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,397
have a chance, right?

119
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:39,357
A chance for a good
 life again, right?

120
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,357
Perhaps...

121
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:48,097
I can go to that room
 without hurting....

122
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,507
someday, right?

123
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,137
Honey...

124
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:00,977
please cling onto me once.

125
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,207
Okay.

126
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,147
Okay...

127
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,397
 

128
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:51,467
Gosh, now we're even 
doing kids' birthday parties.

129
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,447
Are you a company shareholder?

130
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,317
Why make more work?

131
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,247
Geez, what I meant was...

132
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:01,437
Thanks to you, I'm working hard

133
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:04,397
and feel a sense of 
ownership. It's all good.

134
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:09,237
Yoo Ri, you're getting 
prettier these days.

135
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,607
Your skin has this luminous glow...

136
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,167
What products do you use?

137
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,267
Just whatever that's around.

138
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,667
I knew it.

139
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,067
You can't beat youth.

140
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,467
Your skin glows even
 if you use whatever.

141
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,267
Even if I smother on an entire
 jar of expensive cream,

142
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:25,867
I still don't get that glow.

143
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,217
Isn't that right?

144
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,467
Huh? Ice cream ahjumma?

145
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:43,567
Hello.

146
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:45,047
This way.

147
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:48,327
As you've heard, "Joyful Time"

148
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,157
is a birthday party event
 for the children of our

149
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:53,747
department store's VIP customers.

150
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:57,777
Since it's Ha Rim's birthday party,
 her opinion counts the most.

151
00:13:57,777 --> 00:14:00,357
I want to have it with Min Joon.

152
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,157
Min Joon is a good 
friend of Ha Rim...

153
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,937
He's my boyfriend.

154
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,967
Min Joon's birthday is 
the week after mine.

155
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,537
I want a "couple" themed 
birthday party.

156
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:11,857
Will that be okay?

157
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:13,977
What concept would you 
like for your party?

158
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,127
Ha Rim, what are your 
favorite things?

159
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,257
Princess Elsa from "Frozen"?

160
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,527
Ddo Bot?

161
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,267
Alpacas.

162
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,977
As in an alpaca coat?

163
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:23,977
Already?

164
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:27,017
Alpacas?

165
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,507
Yes, alpacas.

166
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,167
Min Joon loves alpacas. 
They're his fave.

167
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:37,477
We'll see you at the party.

168
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,607
Thank you.

169
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:40,407
Bye, Ahjumma!

170
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:50,287
We're better off trying to 
make Olaf from "Frozen."

171
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,337
I don't even know what an alpaca
 looks like. Where do we get one?

172
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:56,187
Well, alpacas are existing animals.

173
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,847
There's an alpaca farm 
out in the suburbs.

174
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:03,427
Contact them and see if
 they'll host a party.

175
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:05,687
I thought kids would be easier,

176
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:07,817
but they're so creative. 
It's a headache.

177
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:12,147
So, is Director Park adjusting 
well with higher-ups?

178
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:16,447
Maybe he's happy as if the world is
 sparkling bright, 24/7?

179
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,687
I'll send over the plan after 
we organize the concept.

180
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,907
We're targeting the VIP kids.

181
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:41,297
We'll lock in the VIPs in their 30's 
and 40's with young children.

182
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,027
This event was 
engineered to entice

183
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:46,127
their young kids because 
they're potential customers.

184
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,667
Was this Ms. Na's idea?

185
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,567
Yes, sir.

186
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,847
Report back as things progress.

187
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,237
Yes, sir.

188
00:15:58,427 --> 00:15:59,847
Why did you do it?

189
00:16:07,957 --> 00:16:10,077
I apologize for causing
 you concern.

190
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,287
It's over now.

191
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,257
Getting involved with a woman...

192
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:18,687
Sure.

193
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,607
It can happen to a guy.

194
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:23,497
But she's my daughter.

195
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:28,067
I'm sure you were aware
 of the risks involved.

196
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:36,907
If you want me to
 take responsibility...

197
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,347
then I will.

198
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:42,077
Is it really over now?

199
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,457
Yes.

200
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:46,797
Then we're good.

201
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,467
No need to ever bring up 
that subject again.

202
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,937
You may leave.

203
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,347
Oh, right.

204
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:03,427
Going forward, Secretary Kim 
will take care of Yoo Ri's matters.

205
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,627
Just so you know.

206
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,597
For the current 
personnel reassignment,

207
00:17:29,367 --> 00:17:31,047
let's also transfer...

208
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:36,067
Management Team's Deputy GM 
Na Jung Sun to the Ulsan branch.

209
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,817
I'll explain...

210
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:56,117
everything to Father.

211
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:01,397
I told Vice President
 that we ended things.

212
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:05,997
What will happen to you...

213
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:08,257
and Ms. Na?

214
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,137
Will you part ways?

215
00:18:18,857 --> 00:18:20,707
If you two break up,

216
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,067
will we...

217
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,687
have a chance?

218
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,797
No.

219
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:38,647
That will not happen.

220
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:01,047
What?

221
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:05,407
Regarding what happened that day...

222
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:09,147
I need to discuss
 something with you.

223
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,167
No.

224
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:14,257
You even left home because
 you didn't want to talk.

225
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:17,467
And now you want to talk, 
so we should?

226
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,047
Honey, I really...

227
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:20,887
I need some time to think.

228
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,017
I'll call you when I'm ready.

229
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,887
Mishil called this morning.

230
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:18,797
Let's include it in the meeting 
when we get the samples.

231
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:27,867
I'm sorry.

232
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:32,367
I know what an unspeakable
 thing I did to you.

233
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,027
I did something unspeakable.

234
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,927
But I was sincere.

235
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,447
You can hit me.

236
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,127
I'll take it.

237
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,597
No.

238
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,477
You have no idea.

239
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:56,347
You probably want to think that.

240
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:58,647
Since you've had it rough

241
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,407
and it's been a hard life,

242
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,297
it's okay to be a little greedy.

243
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,327
Although others will point fingers,

244
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:08,937
you want to say your love
 was meant to be.

245
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:10,317
But take a good look.

246
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,327
You destroyed someone's entire life.

247
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,567
Does he even love you?

248
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:22,967
Are you sure he doesn't
 feel sorry for you?

249
00:21:24,657 --> 00:21:26,747
It doesn't matter.

250
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,827
As long as I can be with him.

251
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:38,217
I don't care if he feels pity.

252
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:41,007
I hurt for him as well.

253
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:49,027
Ms. Na, you have no idea.

254
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:51,377
The real reason he's hurting.

255
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,967
You don't know, Ms. Na.

256
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,367
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

257
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:21,017
 
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

258
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:25,007
♫  Happy birthday dear Ha Rim  ♫

259
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:28,507
♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫

260
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:31,167
 Happy birthday! 

261
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:33,247
Min Joon, let's blow it out.

262
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:40,767
It totally looks like a one-sided love.

263
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,747
Huh?

264
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:49,067
Seriously...

265
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,637
Wasn't A.I. supposed to
 converse with them?

266
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:52,867
It malfunctioned.

267
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:55,297
Sang Woo, you're the 
substitute for A.I.

268
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:56,927
Who, me?

269
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,097
How am I supposed to...

270
00:22:58,097 --> 00:23:01,607
Keep it at the kids' level and 
answer them accordingly.

271
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:05,197
You can just do as you
 normally do, Sang Woo.

272
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,567
Your voice will be altered anyway.

273
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,967
Keep it as friendly as possible, okay?

274
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:12,447
The kids will swarm here soon.

275
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:13,927
Go and set up quickly.

276
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:16,397
But Ms. Lee, really...

277
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,867
Yeah, I'll be right there.

278
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,277
How can I do this?

279
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,847
Man, seriously.

280
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,747
Min Joon!

281
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,987
Let's take this to the alpacas.

282
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:29,497
I don't want to. They stink.

283
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:31,847
But you said you wanted
 to see alpacas.

284
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:34,137
I don't like alpacas anymore.

285
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:36,687
Min Joon!

286
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,017
Min Joon...

287
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,427
"Well, should we put 
some photos here...

288
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,587
Where else should I 
take more photos?"

289
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:55,067
Man, that'll seem too cocky.

290
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:00,247
"Ms. Lee."

291
00:24:01,997 --> 00:24:05,277
Why act cute all of 
a sudden? So gross.

292
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,437
Relax and be natural.

293
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:08,727
Just be yourself, really.

294
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:13,437
"Ms. Lee, how about we..."

295
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:14,667
Yes.

296
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,547
- "Ms. Lee, I..."
- Yes?

297
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,117
Oh, whoa.

298
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:19,467
What's up?

299
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,117
Well, I was...

300
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:24,827
I mean...

301
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:26,327
The photos...

302
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:29,747
of those goats. 
Wait, what are they again...

303
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:32,207
Those...

304
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:36,037
Do we need additional photo spots?

305
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:39,967
The meet and greet room in the 
back and the alpaca farm.

306
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,297
We'll need a few more photos.

307
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:43,487
Okay.

308
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:49,067
Please...

309
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:50,877
just relax.

310
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,067
Sure. Okay.

311
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,937
After you get dumped...

312
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,057
it's hard to relax and be yourself.

313
00:25:12,227 --> 00:25:15,947
I've made preparations 
so we can be at ease...

314
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:21,597
Hyun Ah, why do you seem okay?

315
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:24,057
I look so pathetic here.

316
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:34,677
I don't want you to misunderstand. 
I'm not miffed, really.

317
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:51,127
Assistant Manager Cha.

318
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:54,157
Team Leader wants you to wrap up
 and be back in the office.

319
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,607
Mongle.

320
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:05,737
It's good to be a grown-up, huh?

321
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,357
I think my grade school 
days were the best.

322
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:11,937
Mongle, Mongle, who's 
the fairest of them all?

323
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,007
Okay, the correct answer is 
Seolhyun, Irene, and Suzy.

324
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,737
I don't want to study, but 
my mom keeps forcing me.

325
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:20,397
Why would she do that?

326
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,527
It's kind of like preparing
 for her retirement.

327
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,767
Geez, what the heck am I doing?

328
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,187
This is sad.

329
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:44,597
I can't handle their energy.

330
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,477
Kids are like that.

331
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,857
Did you decide to have it?

332
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:58,707
I don't know what I should do.

333
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:03,427
Director Bae...

334
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:05,147
Be careful.

335
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:08,847
It's not good to get involved with him.

336
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:12,327
Why would you say that to me?

337
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:19,867
I've seen you with 
Director Bae a lot these days.

338
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,547
It's regarding work.

339
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,887
I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.

340
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,457
What are your future aspirations?

341
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:44,887
I've met a lot of these
 types while working.

342
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:47,987
Ones who are confident
 and self-assured.

343
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:50,507
When I saw people like that,

344
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:53,157
"I want to be among them."

345
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:55,297
I thought of that.

346
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:02,387
At this point, I just
 want to do better.

347
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,027
Is the interview going well?

348
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,857
- Yes.
- Good.

349
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:12,777
Minimize the details 
of her personal life,

350
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:16,107
- and focus on her professional life.
- Yes, sir.

351
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,267
- Thank you.
- Yes.

352
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:22,707
No.

353
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,947
Notify Director Park for now.

354
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:48,947
Excuse me! By any chance...

355
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,617
Have you seen Ha Rim?

356
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:52,737
Isn't she at the party?

357
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:54,977
Min Joon wanted to go 
home all of a sudden,

358
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:57,077
so I sent him off and
 looked for Ha Rim.

359
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,607
But I can't find her anywhere.

360
00:28:58,607 --> 00:28:59,887
Don't worry, ma'am.

361
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,977
She must be in the vicinity. 
We'll look for her.

362
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:08,014
Ha Rim!

363
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,094
Ha Rim!

364
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,074
Ha Rim!

365
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:37,274
I prepared everything 
Min Joon likes.

366
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:40,244
But I guess Min Joon 
didn't like any of it.

367
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,304
Min Joon is a meanie.

368
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,294
You prepared all this.

369
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:46,694
No, Min Joon is not a meanie.

370
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:50,434
He's just that way today.

371
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:52,304
He's usually nice.

372
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:54,504
Do you like Min Joon that much?

373
00:29:56,224 --> 00:29:57,054
Yes.

374
00:29:57,884 --> 00:29:59,814
Min Joon is lucky.

375
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:03,484
Someone likes him this much.

376
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,224
But...

377
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,664
Min Joon said he doesn't like me.

378
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:16,874
He said he wants to break up.

379
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:19,854
He doesn't like me anymore.

380
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:23,574
We were getting along so well.

381
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,334
I hate Min Joon.

382
00:30:35,744 --> 00:30:37,294
It's all right.

383
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,984
You'll be okay.

384
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:52,114
After Ms. Na took over the Management 
Team, the vibe is better, right?

385
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:55,234
- We'll take that one.
- Okay.

386
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,934
Oh, yes.

387
00:30:56,984 --> 00:31:00,164
When Director Park was the team 
leader, didn't he wear you out?

388
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:02,324
He's prickly and not too talkative.

389
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,894
If he were my boss, 
he'd be exhausting.

390
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:12,754
May I please get going now?

391
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:13,734
Yes.

392
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,234
You did great.

393
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:38,374
Where were you? 
Mommy was so worried.

394
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:42,054
Thank you.

395
00:31:42,054 --> 00:31:43,104
Don't mention it.

396
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,874
- Please go up there.
- Let's go.

397
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,864
All right, then. 
The birthday girl is back.

398
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:53,914
Should we open the presents now?

399
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,034
 Yay! 

400
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:08,834
You said you'll be responsible.

401
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,784
You're responsible for the
 feeding time, okay?

402
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:12,204
Okay!

403
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,364
She's still a kid.

404
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,444
Geez...

405
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:42,504
Aigoo...

406
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,314
Now that it's over, it works again.

407
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:57,844
Will it hear me out?

408
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:07,174
Tell me if something's 
on your mind.

409
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:23,564
I lost something precious to me.

410
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:26,484
What is it?

411
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:29,854
A person.

412
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,104
No...

413
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:35,704
perhaps it's a memory.

414
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:42,584
So I don't know what to do anymore.

415
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:44,674
Hang on for a second.

416
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:48,624
All right.

417
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,824
I just came back from the future.

418
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:55,044
I saw your future self, and

419
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:56,844
you looked happy.

420
00:33:58,214 --> 00:34:00,864
You looked confident 
as if nothing happened,

421
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,734
and you looked amazing.

422
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,754
So don't worry.

423
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,974
You'll be happy for sure.

424
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,474
I guarantee it.

425
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:14,184
Thanks.

426
00:34:37,504 --> 00:34:39,704
He's checking on things.

427
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:41,514
Yes.

428
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,604
Happy birthday.

429
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,174
Great job.

430
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,894
Do you have anything to say to 
Ms. Na about today's event?

431
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:59,354
You should look at the big picture

432
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:01,914
and learn how to speak 
to your subordinates.

433
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:09,994
Submit the event 
report by tomorrow.

434
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:11,324
Yes, sir.

435
00:35:15,014 --> 00:35:16,134
Let's go.

436
00:35:21,624 --> 00:35:25,534
It's a family business and all, but what 
a screwy way to manage the business.

437
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:43,404
- Yes.
- I didn't know you came.

438
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:45,384
Yes, just stopping by.

439
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:46,734
Go on ahead.

440
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:49,534
What about the meeting 
with Sr. Managing Director Choi...

441
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:51,734
I'll give him a call separately.

442
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,634
You don't need to worry about it.

443
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:55,974
Yes, sir.

444
00:36:28,774 --> 00:36:30,334
Thanks for your hard work.

445
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,234
- Please take care of the cleanup.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:35,944
Director Park.

447
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,744
I'm not sure if I should
 say this, but

448
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,934
please get our rankings 
straightened out.

449
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:46,484
Ms. Na is the head 
of our department,

450
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:49,914
but Vice President told Yoo Ri
 that she's a subordinate...

451
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,434
Anyway...

452
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:58,454
please attend to this matter.

453
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:08,614
- Did you have fun today?
- Yes!

454
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:10,494
Because I have Happy.

455
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,834
- You named her already?
- Yes.

456
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:15,294
Happy, you're happy, right?

457
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:17,144
Ha Rim. Let's go.

458
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,354
Okay, Mom!

459
00:37:23,884 --> 00:37:24,934
Ahjumma.

460
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:28,154
Me crying earlier is 
a secret, okay? Hush.

461
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:31,004
Bye, Ahjumma!

462
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,544
Kids are so lucky.

463
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:43,074
They snap right back.

464
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:45,034
Should I get a dog, too?

465
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:47,534
What a relief.

466
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:48,934
Let's go.

467
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:59,374
Ms. Na will be transferred
 to the Ulsan branch.

468
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:06,524
I can't have you and Ms. Na
 in the same department.

469
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,354
Yes.

470
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,784
What?

471
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:21,734
 Sung Un Group appointed Chairman
 Ha Dae Woo's daughter Ha Tae Young 

472
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,534
  as the President of 
Sung Un Department Store. 

473
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:27,354
  Appointed President Ha Tae Young
 is the former CFO  

474
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:29,434
  of the globally renowned GW Group. 

475
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,274
 Sung Un Department Store will hold 
interim shareholders meeting next week 

476
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:35,844
 and bring up the agenda for her 
to assume the CEO position. 

477
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:38,904
 Since Sung Un Department
 Store's VP Ha Jae Woong 

478
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:42,244
 was deemed as the expected
 heir of Sung Un Group... 

479
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,224
This is Na Jung Sun.

480
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:09,034
This is Jung In Young 
from the HR Department.

481
00:39:09,034 --> 00:39:11,234
What's going on? 
You're being transferred?

482
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,264
 Was this cleared with you, Ms. Na? 

483
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:14,584
A transfer?

484
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:16,894
I received next week's list 
for personnel reassignment.

485
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:20,694
It says you're assigned to
 Ulsan branch's food department.

486
00:39:21,674 --> 00:39:22,644
Excuse me?

487
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:26,104
 I heard that the VP was
 behind this transfer. 

488
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:29,704
 But Director Park is the VP's
 right-hand man. There's no way, right? 

489
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:32,124
 Perhaps it was 
Sr. Manager Director Ha? 

490
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:36,394
 I thought you'd be promoted 
as the Management Team's leader. 

491
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:37,434
I see.

492
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:52,794
How could appointing the president

493
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:55,454
be done like an ambush attack?

494
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:57,744
Didn't the Vice President 
say anything?

495
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:03,924
Didn't he know that his 
older sister will be appointed?

496
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,414
Aigoo...

497
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:07,724
The war between the brothers...

498
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,954
is now a war between the siblings?

499
00:40:14,364 --> 00:40:15,514
Hyung.

500
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:19,874
A strange thought
 occurred to me today.

501
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:21,874
I just can't...

502
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:24,854
get it out of my head. So I'll ask.

503
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:30,224
I know it's nonsense, but...

504
00:40:30,224 --> 00:40:32,144
Yoo Ri isn't the woman, right?

505
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,004
It's not, right?

506
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:48,454
Are you crazy? A woman in the 
same department as Jung Sun?

507
00:40:52,854 --> 00:40:55,064
Hyung, how could you 
do that to Jung Sun?

508
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:56,024
Huh?

509
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,394
I'm the senseless one.
 You're not like that...

510
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:00,734
What's wrong with you?

511
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:05,794
I didn't know I was this
 senseless and emotional, either.

512
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:10,134
But after I met her...

513
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,434
that's how I've been.

514
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:14,454
This is nuts, really.

515
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:18,494
Does Vice President know?

516
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:20,744
Yeah.

517
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:27,814
I think the VP is keeping a
 distance from you. Be careful.

518
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:31,574
You know what happens 
if you cross that man.

519
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:43,734
So how is Jung Sun doing...

520
00:41:58,024 --> 00:42:00,904
 Yoo Ri, you're getting 
prettier these days. 

521
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:04,344
 I knew it. You can't beat youth. 

522
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:19,944
What about Sr. Managing Director Choi 
and Managing Director Park?

523
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:22,914
It seems they're siding with 
President Ha Tae Young.

524
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:24,794
Those fickle bastards...

525
00:42:42,614 --> 00:42:43,774
Sit down.

526
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:52,914
I confirmed things with Director Park,

527
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:56,144
but I thought I should 
make sure with you, too.

528
00:42:57,484 --> 00:42:59,534
You've ended things...

529
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:01,644
with Director Park, right?

530
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:05,894
You must.

531
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:08,794
The situation is not good.

532
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,294
If your infidelity causes
 a scandal now,

533
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:14,954
we can't have that.

534
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,604
He and Ms. Na...

535
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:20,554
will be parting ways.

536
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:22,634
Then it won't matter.

537
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,254
Yoo Ri.

538
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,764
Are you saying...

539
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,214
 

540
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,674
May I take this call?

541
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,404
Hello?

542
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:45,854
Pardon?

543
00:44:00,544 --> 00:44:01,744
 Yeah. 

544
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:03,064
 Who is it? 

545
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:07,814
Oh!

546
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:11,344
Wow, Ms. Song Mi Na!

547
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:14,044
Welcome! Come here, 
come here. Hurry.

548
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:16,214
You guys go outside. Go.

549
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:22,864
Bye, unnis!

550
00:44:22,864 --> 00:44:24,384
Madam Song.

551
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:27,904
Yup.

552
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,034
Aigoo...

553
00:44:36,034 --> 00:44:38,834
Why are you sitting so 
far away? It's you and me.

554
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,294
I'm getting sad.

555
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:50,554
I guess I'll go over there.

556
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:02,244
Director Bae.

557
00:45:03,124 --> 00:45:04,834
I can't do this.

558
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,994
If you give me another 
assignment, I'll do it. But...

559
00:45:08,994 --> 00:45:11,134
I don't think I can do...

560
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:13,134
what you asked me
 to do last time.

561
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,424
Is that right?

562
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:23,434
Then...

563
00:45:24,574 --> 00:45:28,024
I can't guarantee your 
future, Mi Na.

564
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:32,604
I'm still a director.

565
00:45:34,474 --> 00:45:38,434
I still have the authority 
to fire an employee.

566
00:45:40,064 --> 00:45:43,134
Director Bae, what you 
requested of me is illegal.

567
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,794
If it's revealed that you 
ordered me to do that,

568
00:45:45,794 --> 00:45:47,964
you'll be in hot water as well.

569
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:51,304
Fine.

570
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,174
It could be...

571
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:58,224
a difficult task for...

572
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,534
a woman like yourself.

573
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:01,434
Yup.

574
00:46:02,474 --> 00:46:04,914
I completely understand.

575
00:46:04,914 --> 00:46:07,344
If you really can't deliver,

576
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,194
try doing something else.

577
00:46:13,124 --> 00:46:14,784
What?

578
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,864
If you can get by with this,

579
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:19,304
it's beneficial for you, isn't it?

580
00:46:20,634 --> 00:46:23,434
Whoa! Wow, your body, seriously...

581
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:27,034
Mi Na, you don't seem like 
a woman with two kids.

582
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:28,504
Wow!

583
00:46:29,534 --> 00:46:30,634
It's a compliment, a compliment.

584
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:33,824
Mi Na. You know, right? Huh?

585
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:34,834
 Mi Na? 

586
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:43,174
Mi Na.

587
00:46:43,174 --> 00:46:44,354
Mi Na.

588
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:46,184
Hey...

589
00:46:51,674 --> 00:46:52,934
- Come out.
- What the heck?

590
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,794
- Come here, you bastard.
- What the heck, punk?

591
00:46:54,794 --> 00:46:55,734
What are you doing...

592
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:07,134
- Let go!
- What did you do to my wife?

593
00:47:07,134 --> 00:47:09,204
- Stop.
- You won't spill it?

594
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,714
I said, stop!

595
00:47:11,734 --> 00:47:14,534
You have three kids! 
I said, stop!

596
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:18,754
Geez, aigoo...

597
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:20,004
Aigoo...

598
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:30,834
Call the cops...

599
00:47:30,894 --> 00:47:33,834
Call 911. Man, s***...

600
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:35,704
Geez, what the...

601
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,354
We should just part ways tonight.

602
00:47:49,354 --> 00:47:50,704
However...

603
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:54,604
if you don't want 
your husband in jail,

604
00:47:54,604 --> 00:47:58,584
we'll have to discuss this 
properly tomorrow, Song Mi Na.

605
00:48:16,134 --> 00:48:17,434
What the heck was that?

606
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:19,954
Be straight with me.

607
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:22,604
What did that bastard do to you?

608
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:24,754
It's more tangled up now, 
thanks to you.

609
00:48:24,754 --> 00:48:27,554
Should I just standby and 
watch my wife get harassed?

610
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:29,784
I should've beat him to a pulp.

611
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,434
This won't do. Either he 
or I'll die tonight...

612
00:48:32,434 --> 00:48:35,134
I'll die at this rate, so please!

613
00:48:55,084 --> 00:48:56,304
I'm sorry.

614
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:01,544
You wanted to talk last time.

615
00:49:03,144 --> 00:49:05,614
If I had obliged, this wouldn't have...

616
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:14,404
Talk to me.

617
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:16,374
I'll listen sincerely this time.

618
00:49:19,074 --> 00:49:20,574
About the baby, too.

619
00:49:51,674 --> 00:49:54,474
We took care of all the
 necessary procedures.

620
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,854
Let us know if you 
need anything else.

621
00:49:56,854 --> 00:49:59,114
These are Vice President's orders.

622
00:50:27,854 --> 00:50:30,224
 

623
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:35,434
 

624
00:50:58,974 --> 00:51:02,124
 

625
00:51:08,934 --> 00:51:10,234
What's the matter?

626
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,024
My mom...

627
00:51:20,754 --> 00:51:22,864
passed away.

628
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:29,634
My mom...

629
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:52,334
 

630
00:52:12,524 --> 00:52:14,154
What do you want?

631
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:19,264
Ever since that day...

632
00:52:20,354 --> 00:52:23,184
you and I have not talked.

633
00:52:30,174 --> 00:52:31,484
Why did you do it?

634
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:36,284
Why did you?

635
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,694
Fine.

636
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:47,724
After we lost the baby,

637
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:49,754
we had a difficult time.

638
00:52:51,304 --> 00:52:53,104
But it's only been a year.

639
00:52:55,534 --> 00:52:58,034
It was tough only for a year, 
and you couldn't hold back?

640
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,094
It wasn't "only."

641
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:07,134
It wasn't just a year for me.

642
00:53:08,964 --> 00:53:10,984
I also had a hard time 
after losing the baby.

643
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:14,134
I'm allowed to suffer.

644
00:53:14,134 --> 00:53:16,684
I can be worn down, too.

645
00:53:16,684 --> 00:53:18,954
Are you saying that's 
why you cheated on me?

646
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:22,184
Because I wore you down?

647
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:24,684
I'm only saying it wasn't 
easy for me, either.

648
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:27,764
I waited.

649
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:30,344
But not for you to get better.

650
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:34,784
I waited for us to 
endure it together.

651
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:39,204
But I didn't exist to you then.

652
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:43,644
That was my most difficult time...

653
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:48,854
- but you weren't there.
- You should've told me.

654
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:52,324
"I'm worn down." "I'm having 
a hard time." You should've told me!

655
00:53:52,324 --> 00:53:54,224
You were dying. How could I?

656
00:53:56,354 --> 00:53:58,184
If I showed my suffering,

657
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:00,404
we'd all crumble together.
 How could I do that?

658
00:54:02,794 --> 00:54:04,544
Don't make me laugh.

659
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:06,764
You merely avoided it.

660
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:09,134
You didn't want to face it, 
so you ignored it.

661
00:54:09,134 --> 00:54:10,584
But you have no idea...

662
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,114
about my state at the time.

663
00:54:13,114 --> 00:54:16,014
I was going crazy myself,

664
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,674
but I pressed it down...

665
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,734
and endured it day by day.

666
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:26,904
And?

667
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:31,474
You had to endure every 
single day with me...

668
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,434
but did you feel like you can breathe
 after meeting that woman?

669
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:43,424
Then why did you come back to me?

670
00:54:43,424 --> 00:54:44,994
Because I wanted to
 turn things back.

671
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:48,584
I know I'm a crazy bastard, but...

672
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:52,824
I wanted to turn things
 back if I could.

673
00:54:55,634 --> 00:54:58,644
When you asked me to
 cling onto you once...

674
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:04,064
I wanted to grab that chance.

675
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:09,354
Did you...

676
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,674
Did you come back 
because I clung onto you?

677
00:55:14,674 --> 00:55:16,844
It's not like that.

678
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:32,624
You were...

679
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:39,564
the best thing to ever happen to me.

680
00:55:39,564 --> 00:55:42,474
So I wanted to protect it till the end.

681
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:45,754
And her...

682
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,254
That's right.

683
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:51,954
She shouldn't have 
come into my life.

684
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:54,384
But...

685
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:59,874
I knew I shouldn't, but...

686
00:56:03,414 --> 00:56:05,214
I was hurting for her.

687
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:12,194
You really loved her then.

688
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:22,754
What about me?

689
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:30,134
You don't love me?

690
00:56:32,604 --> 00:56:34,414
It's not like that.

691
00:56:38,814 --> 00:56:40,364
Jung Sun...

692
00:56:44,574 --> 00:56:45,854
Get out.

693
00:56:49,174 --> 00:56:50,674
Please leave.

694
00:57:05,584 --> 00:57:07,244
You still do, right?

695
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:14,154
You still love her, right?

696
00:57:18,414 --> 00:57:19,804
I'm sorry.

697
00:58:39,374 --> 00:58:40,724
My mom...

698
00:58:42,374 --> 00:58:44,584
My mom left me...

699
00:58:48,334 --> 00:58:51,634
I only had my mom.

700
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:57,024
Only her, but she...

701
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,744
I'll be here.

702
00:59:16,054 --> 00:59:17,164
I'll be...

703
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:23,044
staying by your side.

704
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:40,964
 

705
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:44,824
♫  When I miss the 
smile on your face  ♫

706
00:59:44,824 --> 00:59:51,814
♫  Could we ever turn back  ♫

707
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:55,464
♫  And I'll be shameless  ♫

708
00:59:55,464 --> 00:59:59,404
♫  Waiting for the day with you  ♫

709
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:06,224
♫  I trust you in the darkness  ♫

710
01:00:06,224 --> 01:00:07,994
♫  What a shame on me  ♫

711
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:09,894
 I plan on being with On Yoo Ri. 

712
01:00:09,894 --> 01:00:11,294
 I'll expose everything publicly. 

713
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:12,624
 You'll suffer the consequences, too. 

714
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:14,514
 I have nothing to lose 
nor be afraid of. 

715
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:15,774
 You came all the way here
 just to back out? 

716
01:00:15,774 --> 01:00:17,254
 What gives? I know your deal. 

717
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:20,434
 Ms. Na, the text you
 received that night... 

718
01:00:20,434 --> 01:00:21,334
 What? 

719
01:00:21,334 --> 01:00:23,834
 See her only if the divorce is 
finalized and cleared up. 

720
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:25,334
 But you love me! 

721
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:28,164
 We still love each other... 

722
01:00:28,164 --> 01:00:31,784
♫  When I miss the 
smile on your face  ♫

723
01:00:31,784 --> 01:00:34,966
♫  Could we ever turn back  ♫
