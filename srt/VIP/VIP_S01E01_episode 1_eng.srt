1
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:31,141
 

2
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:51,231
 

3
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,071
 

4
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:12,941
  The call is not going through...  

5
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,141
Ahjumma, what are you doing?

6
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,391
I'm checking to see if 
the cat is eating.

7
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,311
But why watch him from over here?

8
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:23,331
Because I'm scared.

9
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,741
I'm afraid of cats.

10
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,861
Then why are you feeding him?

11
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:30,551
He's so thin, all skin and bones. 
Plus, he keeps following me.

12
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,081
I think he got skinnier 
following me around.

13
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,631
I feel responsible.

14
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,761
Why do you keep following me?

15
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,651
So you'll feel responsible.

16
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,641
I want some chocolate ice cream.

17
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,061
Yes.

18
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:22,411
Honey, how come 
I can't get a hold of you?

19
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,451
Me?

20
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,651
I got robbed.

21
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,841
No, I'll tell you later.

22
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,311
Yes, okay.

23
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:32,671
Aigoo...

24
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,081
You got it all over you.

25
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,541
There.

26
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,061
What would you like today?

27
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,361
American brands.

28
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:39,961
Then we'll get started.

29
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:08,021
We'll bring one size up.

30
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,781
Ma'am, we brought out 
your usual size,

31
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:15,541
- but it seems...
- Are you saying I gained weight?

32
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,371
This brand runs smaller 
than other brands...

33
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:19,811
You knew that but brought this out.

34
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,751
You're telling me to get in shape.

35
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,501
Ma'am, that's not it...

36
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,991
I won't wear a size 55.

37
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,561
Bring me a size 44 that fits.

38
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,481
Hey.

39
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,541
Let's take it easy.

40
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,461
What gives? It's more 
hardcore in reality.

41
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:47,761
Practice runs should 
be treated as such.

42
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,471
My blood pressure may 
go up, and I'll collapse.

43
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:51,741
Ms. Kim Jin Ah is 
sensitive about sizing.

44
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,641
Remove the ones running small.

45
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:57,331
The lighting is too bright and 
I can't see the texture well.

46
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:00,731
We should dim the lights 
and lower the music.

47
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,791
It's our day off. What are we doing?

48
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,191
Who asked you to plan 
private trunk shows?

49
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,951
Even this simulation is 
wearing me out. I'm dying.

50
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:11,101
Director Kang, you always 
shine during showtime.

51
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:12,281
What's the matter with you?

52
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,731
Please don't do stuff like this, okay?

53
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:16,511
No high maintenance stuff...

54
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,771
No, wait.

55
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,641
Just don't do anything. Please.

56
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,641
I heard Lee Hyun Ah is back.

57
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,591
Yes.

58
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,271
Is the mood okay?

59
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,271
No reason it shouldn't be.

60
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:31,451
That's true.

61
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,001
It's not your fault you 
got promoted first.

62
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:37,321
I didn't think she'd come back 
due to her pride, but she did.

63
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,911
He must be putting 
on his own show.

64
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,671
I heard he's an up and 
coming artist.

65
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,471
Do you have some money?

66
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,361
If you do, buy his work.

67
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,241
I heard his work is worth it.

68
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:02,431
That's cruel.

69
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:05,021
We're talking about someone's life.

70
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:08,671
Capitalism is cruel, indeed.

71
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:12,611
Do you have a man?

72
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,301
Even so, please take it.

73
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:25,331
You might end up needing it.

74
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,141
This isn't the appropriate place
 for exchanging numbers.

75
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:32,121
They say a fateful encounter can happen 
regardless of time and place.

76
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,791
I admire your bravado,

77
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,721
but I'm not interested in 
playing games I may lose.

78
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,501
Yes, this is Lee Hyun Ah.

79
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:14,061
Goodness.

80
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,621
My apologies.

81
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,921
We'll be deciding our one-day-class
 instructor for this month.

82
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,941
Who hasn't participated yet?

83
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,831
Well...

84
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:46,791
It may be difficult for me to get 
some time off this month...

85
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,431
Well, you're a working mom.

86
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:53,141
Then Jin Young's mom, 
could you take charge?

87
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:54,811
Okay, I will.

88
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:59,231
Also, the academy's assistant.

89
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:03,031
I think we should share 
duties here, too. So...

90
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:05,231
This and that, too...

91
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,001
What?

92
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,161
They're fighting and 
won't stop crying.

93
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,981
 - Get Young Joon on the phone. 
- Okay.

94
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:15,561
Hey.

95
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,381
Young Joon, it's Mom.

96
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:18,941
Mom's on the phone.

97
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:21,151
Mommy...

98
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,401
Lee Young Joon, hush.

99
00:11:28,101 --> 00:11:29,401
 Mommy... 

100
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:32,401
If you keep crying, I'll tell your 
dad to make ddukbokki.

101
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,971
 Tell Seo Joon, too. 

102
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:44,831
Mommy said daddy will make 
ddukbokki if we don't stop crying.

103
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,731
Yeah, give it to me.

104
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,621
They stopped crying right away. 
What did you say?

105
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,911
You can't handle this by yourself?

106
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,421
Geez, when are you coming?

107
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,181
They're starting to scare me now.

108
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,201
 It's not a marathon 
meeting or something. 

109
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:02,331
 The PTA meeting has been
 on since the morning? 

110
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:03,961
I'm going now.

111
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,131
All right.

112
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:14,761
Okay, then.

113
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,891
Since you stopped crying,

114
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,321
I'll reward you with ddukbokki!

115
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,291
What now?

116
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:41,811
I'm sorry, Manager. 
I thought it was my family.

117
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,811
Pardon?

118
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:49,861
Yes.

119
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,301
What?

120
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:58,641
 

121
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,761
 

122
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:23,521
What's the situation?

123
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:28,631
Client Ms. Hwang In Ok. 
Model #NDRX4 by 6 o'clock tonight.

124
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:30,471
She would like these shoes.

125
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,851
Hwang In Ok?

126
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:34,881
Could it be that Hwang In Ok? 
Right now she's in...

127
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,551
They're scheduled to arrive tomorrow, 
so they're not available right now.

128
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,081
I'm checking with 
our overseas branch.

129
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:46,341
Manager Lee and Mi Na, 
scope the overseas stock asap.

130
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,651
Deputy GM Na, prepare in 
case we can't get them.

131
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,451
- Make a list of similar items.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:53,441
Take charge of the VIP
 follow-up as well, Ms. Na.

133
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,511
But she called me, 
so I should do it myself...

134
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:59,331
I'll make the first follow-up call, 
then Ms. Na will take over.

135
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:03,931
It will give an impression we care more,
 the higher the personnel rank.

136
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:09,631
Yes, sir.

137
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:15,251
Sang Woo, contact the accounting department 
and check on the necessary documents.

138
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,151
The office is closed today. 
How can I call them...

139
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:21,971
I'll help him with the procedure.

140
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,861
She is the chairman's VIP.

141
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,571
Let's make sure all goes smoothly.

142
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:31,701
 Yes, sir. 

143
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:35,281
Sang Woo.

144
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:41,671
Since our job requires 
many off-duty interactions,

145
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,401
we have a separate 
emergency contact list.

146
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,531
Okay.

147
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,031
Deputy GM, but...

148
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,431
This Hwang In Ok.

149
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:52,981
Is she the wife of Sungjin Corp.'s 
owner, who was on the news?

150
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,781
Then this is really for...

151
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:59,111
Wow, she's a conglomerate's 
wife. It's on a different level...

152
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:04,511
What Ms. Hwang In Ok wants is her 
desired items at the desired time.

153
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:07,681
Our job is to satisfy the VIP clientele.

154
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,741
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,051
 

156
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:19,731
Let's send the substitutes
 to the VIP first for now.

157
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:21,241
Ms. Na, please take care of it.

158
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,551
Yes, I will.

159
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:27,441
Any word regarding the 
overseas stock?

160
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,031
No, we're still checking.

161
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:31,871
What about the 
accounting department?

162
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:33,741
Well, that...

163
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:37,311
They're asking which documents 
we need exactly, but

164
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,881
I haven't been told yet...

165
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:42,041
You can't just wait around 
for someone to teach you.

166
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,521
If you don't know which documents,

167
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,771
you should ask and take care of it.

168
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:47,231
I apologize.

169
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:49,171
I'll check on it.

170
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,671
Ms. Na, you're not 
Ma Sang Woo's nanny.

171
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:56,151
Will you always run after 
Ma Sang Woo during work?

172
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,171
Ms. Na, you have things to tend to.

173
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:00,861
Ma Sang Woo should be able to 
take care of his own tasks.

174
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,371
My apologies.

175
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:05,541
I'll give Sang Woo info 
so he can take care of it.

176
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:41,101
We're doing our best to stop the press 
from rereleasing the articles.

177
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:44,151
For now, we submitted 
medical documents for the bail,

178
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,131
and the doctor's diagnosis.

179
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,311
However...

180
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:56,921
I'm Na Jung Sun, Deputy GM of 
Sung Un Department Store.

181
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,241
The legal circles fear special 
treatment controversy these days.

182
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:06,111
Drugs were found on the scene

183
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:07,691
and many eyes are on this case.

184
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:10,111
Receiving bail for today 
could be difficult.

185
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:11,511
Attorney Park.

186
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:15,031
This is why I pay your 
law firm a lot of money.

187
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:16,841
If I wanted to hear the same thing,

188
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:18,901
why would I spend 
that money on you?

189
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,091
Huh?

190
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,291
If I'm still here at 6 p.m. tonight,

191
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,931
find a new job other 
than an attorney.

192
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:24,921
Got it?

193
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:25,871
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,581
Attorney Park.

195
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,161
What's this?

196
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:01,691
Samples of shoes similar 
to the style you requested.

197
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,541
Bringing in goods to the
 visiting area is prohibited,

198
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,211
so I requested 
our attorneys for help.

199
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:08,631
Model #NDRX4 hasn't
 been imported yet.

200
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,511
So we're searching 
the overseas stock.

201
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:13,551
If in the case they 
won't arrive on time,

202
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,511
- we prepared similar...
- They're similar?

203
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,041
In what ways?

204
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,821
How could you keep your job
 with such eyes, huh?

205
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:22,661
Then I'll bring different styles...

206
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:25,981
If I needed a different pair, 
I would've requested them.

207
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:28,911
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,891
I'll do my best to deliver 
model #NDRX4 in time.

209
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:36,071
Doing your best or whatever.
 I don't care about that.

210
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:41,161
You just deliver 
exactly what I need.

211
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,081
If you understood in 
the first place,

212
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,731
you wouldn't tire me out like this.

213
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:46,971
Yes.

214
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:51,341
I'll deliver so you can wear 
them on your way out.

215
00:18:57,911 --> 00:18:59,401
Good work.

216
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,371
Making a living is 
supposed to be stressful.

217
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:04,391
- Call me when you get the product.
- Okay.

218
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,761
The Japan branch has a pair.

219
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,711
We requested air-shipping 
via an employee.

220
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,951
It should arrive in 
Korea by 3:30 p.m.

221
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:24,931
If we pick them up from the
 airport, we'll deliver on time.

222
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,051
Adding in the customs
 inspection, it's tight.

223
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,861
Please follow up on any 
delivery issues, Mi Na.

224
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:31,871
Yes, sir.

225
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:42,331
So check on this and prepare this.

226
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,531
Wow, I'm dying.

227
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,531
I need to recharge my energy.

228
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:02,041
I feel better now.

229
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,521
It's our day off. What on earth, huh?

230
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,591
I think we're having bad luck.

231
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:08,931
Is it the three-years-tribulation?

232
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,571
How was the prison visit?

233
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,031
Geez...

234
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:14,071
What's so special 
about those shoes...

235
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:17,351
She was arrested on the scene 
during a drug-fueled rampage.

236
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:21,771
The entire nation saw her getting 
carted away while in her slippers.

237
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:25,101
She's concerned about her 
shoes as she comes back out.

238
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:28,061
Why would someone like 
Ms. Hwang use drugs?

239
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,621
Many lead lives with 
a glittering facade.

240
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,121
What?

241
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:44,221
There aren't any issues 
with the delivery, right?

242
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:46,311
It's my family. The kids.

243
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,691
I mean, you both work.

244
00:20:48,691 --> 00:20:50,751
Why do you take care 
of the home and kids both?

245
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,031
If it were me, I would've bailed.

246
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,191
The crisis is over. Go on home.

247
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:56,421
We'll wrap up from here.

248
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,381
No, let's wrap it up together.

249
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,031
Let me take this call.

250
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,751
She should've left 
when she had the chance.

251
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:11,071
Why even bother...

252
00:21:12,801 --> 00:21:14,111
That's it, right there.

253
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,261
You're an old fogy who 
b****es about everything.

254
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,331
Hey.

255
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:24,531
Lee Hyun Ah and "old fogy" are 
not meant to be synonymous.

256
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:30,471
You look at ease these days.

257
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:32,661
Yeah.

258
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,601
I want to be at ease.

259
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,301
Sorry, excuse me for a sec.

260
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,511
He must be guy number three.

261
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:50,081
Hey, who do you think I am?

262
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:52,521
He's number five.

263
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,861
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:06,951
 What are you saying? 

265
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,791
I don't think I can.

266
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:38,731
CITES?

267
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:39,781
Yes.

268
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:42,861
The leather on these shoes 
concerns endangered animals.

269
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,851
Only a limited number is 
allowed in the country.

270
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:47,591
If you want to bring them in, 
we'll need approval documents.

271
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,231
Can we submit the documents later?

272
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,861
We have our procedures.

273
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,721
I'm sorry. I should've 
checked beforehand.

274
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,111
Yes.

275
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:08,661
Pardon?

276
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,031
 

277
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,921
The documents are ready,

278
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,221
but to take the original 
to the airport...

279
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,341
What did the courier say?

280
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,051
They're backed up. 
It'll take 20 minutes.

281
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:25,841
Gosh, the roads are 
congested due to the rain.

282
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,971
If we take a car, we won't
 make it on time.

283
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:30,481
It must be delivered 
by 5 p.m. at the latest.

284
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:33,751
Yes, this Song Mi Na from the 
VIP Management Team.

285
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:35,451
Yes.

286
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:39,371
Pardon? What do you mean...

287
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,571
Yes, I understand.

288
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,241
Thank you for giving us
 the information.

289
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:46,901
Pardon us for the trouble.

290
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,321
It's the Japan branch.

291
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:53,881
Myongil Department Store 
received an #NDRX4 today, too.

292
00:23:53,881 --> 00:23:57,691
The Japan branch reached out to many 
regarding stock, and Myongil must've heard.

293
00:23:57,691 --> 00:23:59,371
If we can't deliver them,

294
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,681
they think Myongil will deliver 
them to Ms. Hwang In Ok.

295
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,171
This is crazy.

296
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:05,161
We can't let Myongil beat us to it.

297
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:06,301
I'll go.

298
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:21,341
Here.

299
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:23,861
I wondered who put this 
in the employee parking lot.

300
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:25,341
Wish me luck.

301
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:27,391
Be careful.

302
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:57,431
 

303
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,971
Ms. Na?

304
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,661
What are you doing? Run.

305
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,781
Hurry.

306
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,191
Safe.

307
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:29,431
Yes, Attorney Park.

308
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:31,451
We'll head over there.

309
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:33,961
Pardon?

310
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:30,211
It was a myocardial infarction?

311
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,901
No one knows what
 tomorrow holds.

312
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:37,731
She was alive and kicking 
just a few hours ago.

313
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:44,491
Then what will happen 
to the shoes?

314
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:49,501
What do you think?

315
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,551
Do you think she'll wear 
them in the afterlife?

316
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:14,831
Thank you.

317
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:16,831
Good job, everyone.

318
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,791
The Vice President left. 
Go on home.

319
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,971
You worked...

320
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,531
hard today.

321
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:41,721
Good job.

322
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:42,891
- Thank you.
- Great job.

323
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:44,431
Good work, everyone.

324
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:54,931
Shall we go?

325
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:05,851
Did your morning meeting go well?

326
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,431
Yes.

327
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:09,651
You know...

328
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:16,071
If you're to die tomorrow, 
what would you like to do?

329
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:20,751
Just because.

330
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,021
Seeing Ms. Hwang go like
 that all of a sudden...

331
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:29,821
Well...

332
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:34,121
I've thought about it, and...

333
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:39,761
I don't want to do 
anything in particular.

334
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:45,241
I think I'm fine living the 
way I've been living.

335
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,441
Worry about what to have
 for lunch while working.

336
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:56,571
Go home and badmouth
 my boss to my husband.

337
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:00,911
If I die after living like that,

338
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:02,651
I think it'll be okay.

339
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,781
So it was nice.

340
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:14,061
Even if I die tomorrow...

341
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:18,821
the thought that it's fine 
to live as I am right now.

342
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:20,771
It was nice.

343
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,561
Honey, you look 
exhausted these days.

344
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:30,651
Exhausted.

345
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:32,861
Yeah...

346
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,631
I've been busy.

347
00:29:37,721 --> 00:29:39,631
Sang Woo should get settled in now.

348
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,731
This is why working for a successful 
team leader is exhausting.

349
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:51,171
Not everyone is as quick as you are.

350
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,151
Was I too sensitive these days?

351
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,011
I know it's because many
 eyes are watching, but...

352
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:06,931
you should take it easy.

353
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,651
Let's not try too hard.

354
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:13,081
Let's take it easy and live
 well before we die.

355
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:14,661
Mr. Park.

356
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:34,067
 

357
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,667
 

358
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,977
You all worked hard yesterday.

359
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:09,707
We will have a new addition 
to our team today.

360
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:12,597
There she is.

361
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:20,117
This is On Yoo Ri.

362
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:22,637
She was assigned to the 
Management Team today.

363
00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:25,237
Say hello.

364
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:30,577
Hello, I'm On Yoo Ri.

365
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,557
Hello!

366
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,797
What brings you all the way here?

367
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:49,597
You've been back for
 a month already,

368
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,867
and you haven't shown your face.

369
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:55,627
I came over myself to 
see your precious face.

370
00:32:57,277 --> 00:32:58,687
Aigoo...

371
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:02,257
Here is the private 
trunk show schedule.

372
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,237
What's going on?

373
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:06,847
She was assigned today.

374
00:33:06,847 --> 00:33:09,307
Are the rumors true?

375
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,937
What rumors?

376
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:12,967
That girl.

377
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:15,417
She used to work at the
 food court, right?

378
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,287
Yes.

379
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,817
If a contract employee from 
the basement food court

380
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:21,387
suddenly gets promoted here,

381
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:23,287
isn't it strange anyway
 you look at it?

382
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:27,067
It's a bit of a stretch to see it 
as a normal promotion.

383
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:30,367
No wonder there are 
so many rumors.

384
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:35,657
Just what are those rumors?

385
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,577
Sang Woo.

386
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:41,047
The proposal is out. Go get it
 from the Design Team.

387
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:45,537
Yes, ma'am.

388
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,157
Please.

389
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,357
Newbies are very quick these days.

390
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,257
He's bound to hear about 
it sooner or later.

391
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:59,307
There's no need to spread 
unconfirmed rumors yourself.

392
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:02,997
The circumstantial evidence states
 those are not just rumors.

393
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:07,857
Hello, Ms. Kang.

394
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:10,687
Yes. I had something for Ms. Na.

395
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,817
On Yoo Ri, you can sit here.

396
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,127
Okay.

397
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:27,857
To simply describe our work,

398
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,357
we take care of the department 
store's VIP clients.

399
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:35,057
Go to this page, enter 
your ID and password.

400
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,217
You'll see your email account.

401
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:39,817
I've never worked in an office before.

402
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:41,457
I don't know my password...

403
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:44,487
Then I'll ask Human Resources 
for the new employee password.

404
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,617
Okay, thank you.

405
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,867
- If you look here...
- Long time no see!

406
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,857
Hello.

407
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:52,857
Aigoo, not again.

408
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,327
Hello.

409
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:55,667
Yes.

410
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:58,157
Didn't you miss me?

411
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:01,087
Ms. Lee. Of course, I missed you.

412
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:02,317
You did?

413
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,667
This is why I like you, dear.

414
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:07,577
You're not very good at lying.

415
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,267
Who is this?

416
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,577
A new face.

417
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:18,667
- Hello.
- Yes.

418
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,367
You know...

419
00:35:20,397 --> 00:35:24,067
she has a different 
style for a newbie.

420
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:26,537
Is this the trending 
style these days?

421
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:28,847
Hello.

422
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,647
Yes.

423
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,007
Let's go inside.

424
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:38,757
 I have pricey info, and I'll give
 it up for coffee. Interested? 

425
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:46,227
She's here again.

426
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,487
Does she think this is her house?

427
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:51,787
Does she usually come over?

428
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,847
Of course not.

429
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,737
The starting point of this tragedy

430
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,607
took place about a month ago.

431
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:02,997
- Hello!
- Oh, Ms. Lee.

432
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:05,357
You're wearing the dress 
you bought last time.

433
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:08,957
- Wow, this dress totally becomes you.
- Right?

434
00:36:08,957 --> 00:36:13,287
But seriously, my husband was upset 
I paid 10 million won for this tent.

435
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,287
I'm so embarrassed, really.

436
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,097
Men are like that. 
They don't know fashion.

437
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:18,217
Tell me about it.

438
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:22,377
Aigoo, so do we have 
any good stuff today?

439
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:23,587
What about this?

440
00:36:23,587 --> 00:36:26,217
- It would be perfect for you.
- I like it.

441
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:28,637
Let's give it a whirl. Yes.

442
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:33,357
 Jin Mi! 

443
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,857
Isn't that rich broad here yet?

444
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:36,937
That polka dot dress from last time...

445
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,527
Hey, what?

446
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:42,577
Ms. Lee...

447
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,477
That rich broad you speak of...

448
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:47,617
Is it me?

449
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:02,047
I'm Na Jung Sun, Deputy GM of 
the VIP Management Team.

450
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:06,657
Our employees committed 
a heinous offense.

451
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,877
My apologies.

452
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,407
It's hot, hot...

453
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,667
I'm sorry. I should've 
cooled the tea more.

454
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,667
Fire them.

455
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,467
I said, fire them.

456
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:20,607
Don't you understand?

457
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:22,537
If you don't fire them,

458
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:25,257
I'll tell the media that you look

459
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:27,987
down on your clients. Wait and see.

460
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:30,887
We'll take disciplinary action 
against the employees.

461
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:32,007
And...

462
00:37:32,007 --> 00:37:34,597
in order to appease you in any way,

463
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,957
we'll compensate you in
 the best possible manner...

464
00:37:36,957 --> 00:37:40,647
Fire them. That's all I want.
 I don't need anything else!

465
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,957
What on earth?

466
00:37:54,957 --> 00:37:57,007
Why are you on your knees?

467
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,777
I know very well

468
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,647
that my kneeling won't 
take away your humiliation.

469
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,947
However,

470
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:06,247
this is the only way to show you...

471
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:08,237
my sincerity right now.

472
00:38:09,277 --> 00:38:10,387
My God...

473
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:15,837
My sincere apologies once again 
for the grave mistake toward you.

474
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,467
But...

475
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:19,177
their employment issue

476
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:22,107
concerns their livelihood.

477
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,387
Regarding that issue...

478
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,757
Fine, fine. You can get up.

479
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,077
People are staring!

480
00:38:36,497 --> 00:38:38,777
You sure have a strange talent.

481
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,427
Why do you make me the bad guy?

482
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,787
I apologize if I've upset you.

483
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,617
Then you do it.

484
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,507
- Pardon?
- My shopper.

485
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:54,097
I said you do it.

486
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,747
Goodness, this is pretty, huh?

487
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:05,147
It's the same design.

488
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,497
But I like this size...

489
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,967
I can't choose. I'll take them all.

490
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:10,347
- Okay.
- I'll take them all.

491
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,917
Yes, this is nice, right?

492
00:39:17,637 --> 00:39:18,937
I'll try on something else.

493
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:20,837
This one is nice, huh?

494
00:39:20,837 --> 00:39:21,627
What do you think?

495
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:24,977
Aigoo...

496
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,367
I'll try this one on.

497
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,567
I like this one.

498
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:32,557
All right...

499
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,277
♫  Santa Lucia...  ♫

500
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:38,397
Good job. Aigoo, great job.

501
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:40,397
I had a great time.

502
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:44,157
All right...

503
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:47,977
See you next time. Bye-bye.

504
00:39:47,977 --> 00:39:49,787
- Thank you.
- Sure.

505
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,817
Let's go.

506
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:57,297
Good job.

507
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:02,157
Since that day, she's 
always coming over here.

508
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:05,497
We recommend other personal 
shoppers, but she refuses.

509
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:10,157
At first, Ms. Na took care of her.

510
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:14,097
But later on, everyone 
took turns helping her.

511
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:20,077
I was held captive for 
five hours last time.

512
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:21,517
You won't send me again, right?

513
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:23,177
Don't worry.

514
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:29,657
Ms. Lee, I'll escort you today...

515
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:33,437
I want the new face 
to help me today.

516
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:40,327
But Yoo Ri was assigned 
to our team today.

517
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,547
She hasn't been properly trained yet.

518
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,567
That's good.

519
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,137
I'll give her a crash course.

520
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,637
I'm the Management Team
 expert, aren't I?

521
00:40:49,107 --> 00:40:51,347
You'll be okay, right?

522
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,297
Yes, I'll escort you.

523
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:56,817
All right.

524
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:00,147
Then Yoo Ri.

525
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:01,937
Take good care of her.

526
00:41:17,407 --> 00:41:19,007
What is it?

527
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:20,637
Let's drink first.

528
00:41:24,037 --> 00:41:27,247
Your team might fall under the 
Marketing Department again.

529
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:28,327
Really?

530
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,947
Then what about 
our team's evaluation?

531
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,487
I'm sure Director Bae will do it.

532
00:41:34,627 --> 00:41:36,057
So I was thinking.

533
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:38,457
Why don't you transfer 
to the Marketing Team?

534
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,647
Marketing Team?

535
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:42,167
I think they have a spot for promotion.

536
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,967
Truthfully, if Lee Hyun Ah didn't 
have a fallout with the team,

537
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,737
she would've been promoted 
the deputy GM already.

538
00:41:48,737 --> 00:41:50,527
They'll take care of her this time.

539
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,727
Wouldn't it be difficult to 
promote two people?

540
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,077
I guess.

541
00:41:58,077 --> 00:42:01,667
I'm saying this out of 
consideration for you.

542
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:07,087
You've been here for six years now.

543
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:09,647
Losing out on a promotion 
for three years is hard.

544
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:11,277
You should strive for 
the manager position.

545
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:12,967
I know that.

546
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:16,617
But the team is 
shorthanded these days...

547
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,287
You shouldn't be 
worrying about others.

548
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,207
Frankly, you're a good 
worker and whatnot.

549
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,887
Because of the three-months 
maternity leave...

550
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,097
Think about it.

551
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,517
If you want to apply,

552
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:34,187
I'll tell their team leader 
and set up an interview.

553
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,957
Okay.

554
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,757
Thank you.

555
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,567
All right.

556
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:06,157
Which one do you think 
looks better on me?

557
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:07,507
Well...

558
00:43:11,977 --> 00:43:14,357
They both look good.

559
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:16,497
Is that right?

560
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:22,447
You're in big trouble.

561
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,467
It looks gaudy even to me.

562
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:27,467
You're more clueless than me. 
What will you do?

563
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:28,967
Give me something else.

564
00:43:35,187 --> 00:43:37,587
Will Yoo Ri be okay?

565
00:43:37,587 --> 00:43:40,127
Talk about an initiation.

566
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,987
But it's her first day. 
This is too hardcore.

567
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,907
For you to act like this is 
overstepping your boundaries.

568
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:53,557
Regardless, those are just words.

569
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:56,037
It's not like you'll do 
something about it.

570
00:43:56,037 --> 00:43:59,347
Unless you take 
responsibility, just let it be.

571
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,597
She'll have to survive somehow.

572
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:06,917
You're right.

573
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:08,917
I should mind my own business.

574
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:15,587
Why aren't you drinking it?

575
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:18,027
The Americano will cool off.

576
00:44:31,437 --> 00:44:33,537
You're nervous, huh?

577
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:37,147
- Yes.
- Why?

578
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:39,407
Is it nerve-racking to be
 in a place like this?

579
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:42,667
It's all right.

580
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:44,437
I was like that, too.

581
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,057
You heard, right?

582
00:44:48,057 --> 00:44:49,687
I'm a rags-to-riches broad.

583
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:53,017
One should know 
how to spend money.

584
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:57,107
I imitated the rich folks and 
started buying various things.

585
00:44:57,107 --> 00:44:59,207
And ended up a VIP.

586
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:00,557
But...

587
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:02,867
I stuck out like a sore
 thumb in this place.

588
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,487
As if I don't belong here.

589
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,737
I bought all the expensive goods,

590
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:10,117
but I can't get rid of 
my country bumpkin image.

591
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:12,847
Is that something 
you're just born with?

592
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:15,937
Well...

593
00:45:16,997 --> 00:45:20,877
You're probably wondering 
why I'm talking about this.

594
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,507
It's just...

595
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:25,647
that you remind me of myself.

596
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,907
That team is something, too.

597
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:28,857
Isn't it?

598
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:36,567
Are you mute? Why won't you speak?

599
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,027
Geez...

600
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:43,087
Must we really fit in?

601
00:45:44,957 --> 00:45:48,587
I was wondering if it's a must.

602
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:00,337
Having something like this will help.

603
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:02,277
I think it will suit you.

604
00:46:02,277 --> 00:46:04,067
No, it's quite all right.

605
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:06,867
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

606
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:08,197
I told you.

607
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:10,717
I'm a rich broad. This is nothing.

608
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,397
You asked if we must really fit in.

609
00:46:16,397 --> 00:46:18,027
I like that.

610
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:19,437
But...

611
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:21,077
in the end, people will

612
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:23,997
judge by what they see 
on the outside.

613
00:46:25,547 --> 00:46:26,847
Drink up.

614
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,487
Daebak.

615
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,457
Manager Lee.

616
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:45,107
Is this rumor true?

617
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:56,597
Get in.

618
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:17,097
 Is On Yoo Ri really involved 
with the Vice President? 

619
00:47:24,147 --> 00:47:26,157
Mind your own business.

620
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:28,137
Okay?

621
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:31,467
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,067
 

623
00:47:51,317 --> 00:47:53,037
See you tomorrow.

624
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,167
Goodnight...

625
00:47:55,477 --> 00:47:59,077
One would think we're 
strangling him to death.

626
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,637
Good job.

627
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:04,357
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

628
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:13,917
Will you be very late?

629
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,807
I'll try not to be.

630
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:17,817
Since the higher-up is slaving away,

631
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:20,327
the subordinates are on their toes.

632
00:48:20,327 --> 00:48:23,227
Don't be too long. 
Come home and eat.

633
00:48:23,227 --> 00:48:24,527
Okay.

634
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:35,607
I'll take this one.

635
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:45,947
I'll take this one.

636
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,567
 

637
00:49:14,297 --> 00:49:19,727
 

638
00:49:27,317 --> 00:49:28,927
 

639
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:33,727
 

640
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:41,147
I'm sorry but take me back 
to the department store.

641
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:42,077
Okay.

642
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:31,467
 

643
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,867
You should step up your game.

644
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,167
 

645
00:53:32,657 --> 00:53:33,987
Are you here?

646
00:53:33,987 --> 00:53:36,527
I took extra pains to...

647
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:39,497
Oh, Mother.

648
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:45,247
Mother, what brings you by?

649
00:53:57,637 --> 00:54:01,087
 

650
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,477
 

651
00:54:19,477 --> 00:54:21,017
 Your mother is here. 

652
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:39,147
I was in the area and stopped 
by to drop these off.

653
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,847
I didn't think you'd be home. 
I was going to leave them.

654
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:44,367
I see.

655
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,107
Jin Tae's second daughter got

656
00:54:46,107 --> 00:54:48,567
medicine from here and 
recovered her health.

657
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,387
Then she got pregnant.

658
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:53,587
Okay.

659
00:54:56,337 --> 00:54:58,247
This medicine is good 
for your health.

660
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:00,967
Take it twice a day starting 
tomorrow morning. Don't forget.

661
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,267
Yes, I will do that.

662
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:05,667
- I'll get going then.
- Mother, have some fruit...

663
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,867
Aigoo, an elder shouldn't 
overstay her welcome.

664
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:09,167
Bye.

665
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:21,637
Call me when you get home.

666
00:55:21,637 --> 00:55:23,507
- Okay, go on in.
- All right.

667
00:55:41,517 --> 00:55:43,867
I guess today is not the day.

668
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:49,287
Where's Mother?

669
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:03,827
I guess today is really not the day.

670
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:51,987
 

671
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,827
 

672
00:57:58,247 --> 00:58:00,857
 

673
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:05,417
♫  Seizing for the truth  ♫

674
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:12,307
♫  But now we realize right, 
nothing's right  ♫

675
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:17,837
♫  I'm chasing all the lies and  ♫

676
00:58:17,837 --> 00:58:19,437
 Do you ever get like this? 

677
00:58:19,437 --> 00:58:22,217
 Someone I thought I knew well... 

678
00:58:22,217 --> 00:58:24,797
 seems like a stranger all of a sudden. 

679
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:27,297
 We'll inspect the 
VIP Services Dept. in action. 

680
00:58:27,297 --> 00:58:29,817
 Pretending to be a customer
 and observing them. 

681
00:58:29,817 --> 00:58:31,147
 Over here! 

682
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:33,887
 How's work going for you? 

683
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:35,487
 Can we meet today? 

684
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:36,447
 I have something to tell you. 

685
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:37,847
 The lie will come to light anyway. 

686
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,347
 I'm sure she wants to cling on. 

687
00:58:39,347 --> 00:58:41,067
 Even though she knows 
it'll come to an end. 

688
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:42,677
 You should re-do your tie. 

689
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:45,887
 My heart. I'll do my best 
to feel this way forever. 

690
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,207
 Do you still feel the same way? 

691
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:52,217
♫  The lies and all the truth  ♫

692
00:58:52,217 --> 00:58:54,227
♫  We tend to the fire...  ♫
