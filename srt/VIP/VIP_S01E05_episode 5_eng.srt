1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,610
 

2
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,730
Geez, who is it?

3
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,850
Oh, sorry. I didn't know 
someone was here.

4
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,200
What are you doing here so late?

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,960
I need to print some things.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,890
Right now?

7
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,620
I missed the last bus, 
so I'll take the first one later.

8
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,740
I'll go to the darkroom with
 the film. Go back to sleep.

9
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,530
Can I join you?

10
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,430
Thank you.

11
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,710
So this is how it's done.

12
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,040
Is this how you print a photo?

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,130
- Never developed film before?
- No.

14
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,040
It's my first time in our club's office

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,810
since the freshmen welcoming party.

16
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,380
Why did you join the
 photography club?

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,020
To get Young Jin oppa
 to go out with me.

18
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,410
You won't ask why I dumped him?

19
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,830
That's between the two of you.

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,420
He's more boring than I thought.

21
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,300
And obsessive, too.

22
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,180
You're like a magician.

23
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,700
But why do you do this 
so early in the morning?

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,690
Because it's quiet.

25
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,220
Plus, I get to see the sunrise.

26
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,790
What is your name?

27
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,670
I think I saw you at
 the welcoming party,

28
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,240
but I don't remember.

29
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,140
I'm Park Sung Joon.

30
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,570
Sung Joon...

31
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm Lee Hyun Ah.

32
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,290
Since Young Jin oppa told 
everyone I'm a crazy b****,

33
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,030
you probably know already.

34
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,830
You won't deny it?

35
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,390
Because it's a fact.

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
Daebak.

37
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,680
They're all portraits.

38
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,490
Do you like people?

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,960
Well...

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,300
sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

41
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,710
Are you always so serious?

42
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,490
Should we get going now?

43
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,130
I think I know why you 
come at this hour.

44
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,320
If I flirt with you, 
will you fall for me?

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,570
Nope.

46
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,550
Why not?

47
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,160
I hate getting into 
complicated relationships.

48
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,570
And you're not my type.

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,290
Then just what is your type?

50
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,860
Someone who has a loyal heart.

51
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,030
I do have a loyal heart.

52
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,940
Well...

53
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,120
it's just that I often have 
a change of heart.

54
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,170
Don't make snap judgments.

55
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,870
I could be your type, you know.

56
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,880
You're good at basketball.

57
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,530
See you later.

58
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,890
Hey, what the heck?

59
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,630
New target?

60
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,100
No, not yet.

61
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,160
- Last target?
- Huh? Last target?

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,040
I'm still too passionate to 
settle down with one guy.

63
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,210
I set him as my final destination.

64
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,790
Geez, whatever.

65
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,680
Even for you, will it go as planned?

66
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,670
Whether it does or not...

67
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,530
let's wait and see.

68
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,600
 

69
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,230
I didn't want you to see me
 this way again, Oppa.

70
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm so embarrassed. It's crazy.

71
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,740
Must you see me at 
my rock bottom?

72
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Pardon?

73
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,910
You're wrong.

74
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,050
- I'm wrong about what?
- It's not what you think.

75
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,790
Just what am I thinking?

76
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,220
I said, what am I thinking?

77
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,110
We're at work.

78
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,630
Let's talk at home.

79
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,690
Honey, you're amazing.

80
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,490
So rational even at times like this.

81
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,500
I'll explain.

82
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,400
I have some debts.

83
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,180
My mom's business went under.

84
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,950
That's why things are troublesome
 in more ways than one.

85
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,870
Since when?

86
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,340
It's been a while.

87
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,760
That's why I came back to work.

88
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,550
Because I needed money.

89
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,600
Why didn't you tell me?

90
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,150
Must I...

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,400
tell you that?

92
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,020
I hit rock bottom in many ways...

93
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,360
I must've lost my mind briefly.

94
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,990
You didn't go home yet?

95
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,530
These are samples for 
the product exhibition.

96
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,620
I was checking in advance.

97
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,960
Go on.

98
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,930
The security chip...

99
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,330
 

100
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,400
 

101
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes, General Manager.

102
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,430
No, it's okay.

103
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,180
I have to see the 
document to tell you.

104
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,590
I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

105
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,400
 

106
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,500
 

107
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
 

108
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
 

109
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,300
 

110
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,390
 

111
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
 

112
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,000
 

113
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,620
Hyun Ah.

114
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,300
Just follow the procedure.

115
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,330
I have nothing to say
 even if I get fired.

116
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,610
The clearance request...

117
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,290
Cancel it.

118
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,480
And erase your records.

119
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,300
You couldn't complete this 
without leaving a trace anyway.

120
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,230
You're a smart girl.

121
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm not sure...

122
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,770
I don't trust myself anymore.

123
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,900
I didn't want you to see me
 this way again, Oppa.

124
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,350
I'm so embarrassed. It's crazy.

125
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,710
Must you see me at 
my rock bottom?

126
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,430
Pardon?

127
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,040
Was I such a lousy friend to you?

128
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,430
That you wouldn't tell me
 of your hardships.

129
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,310
You have to be the
 heroine, don't you?

130
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,130
You must know of 
everything and help out.

131
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,540
Everyone has to like you.

132
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,730
That's it, huh?

133
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,060
I'm tired.

134
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,750
I'm sorry, but I'm not in a state

135
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,430
to cater to you right now.

136
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,910
That's why I didn't tell you.

137
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,840
Then...

138
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,420
what were you thinking earlier?

139
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,550
You thought I was having an 
affair with Sung Joon oppa.

140
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,330
Didn't you?

141
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,880
You should ask yourself.

142
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,920
If you trust me or not.

143
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,210
Go on in.

144
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm a mess myself.
 I couldn't say anything nice.

145
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,150
Let's go.

146
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,790
Let me get some fresh air.

147
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,070
Right now?

148
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,540
Go to bed first.

149
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,840
 

150
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,530
 

151
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,790
 It's over. 

152
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,420
 Is it someone I know? 

153
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,980
 No. 

154
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,040
 I wish you would die. 

155
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,330
 You thought I was having an 
affair with Sung Joon oppa. 

156
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,540
 Didn't you? 

157
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
 

158
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,110
Refer to this for urgent approvals.

159
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,040
You know, right?

160
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,830
The security team will 
penalize us for sharing IDs.

161
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,620
Let's hide it under this pot, 
and it's only for our team.

162
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,100
 The user of the computer
 who sent the text... 

163
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,820
 comes up as Na Jung Sun. 

164
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Hello.

165
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,180
Hi, good morning.

166
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,090
Yes, this is Park Sung Joon.

167
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,490
Yes, sir.

168
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes.

169
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,310
Pardon?

170
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,290
You know that living spaces sales are 
shooting up at department stores, correct?

171
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,970
So we're collaborating with 
a premium interior brand.

172
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,550
We'll target our marketing 
efforts to our VIPs.

173
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,170
We'll bring in the hottest
 interior designer the VIPs like,

174
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,170
and hold interior trend classes.

175
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,990
Each store will be given their

176
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,800
target sales goals.

177
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,090
The Managing Director 
wants it reflected on the

178
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,000
concierge managers' 
year-end evaluation.

179
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,000
A concierge manager's job is 
taking care of each store's VIPs.

180
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,980
If you assign them sales 
goals for specific products,

181
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,920
the managers will be resistant.

182
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,130
Also, the Management Team is in
 charge of the managers.

183
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,370
The Marketing Team is not
 involved in their evaluations.

184
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,200
That's why Managing Director 
gave the special order.

185
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,390
Plus, no putting on high-airs 
at work in this day and age.

186
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,030
We should be more aggressive.

187
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,090
Considering the VIPs' preferences...

188
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,310
Yes, sir.

189
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,440
We'll review the issue on 
hand and get back to you.

190
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,750
Ms. Na, I'm counting on you.

191
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,890
I know you get it.

192
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,620
We're doing this for the
 good of the company,

193
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,580
not for our own benefit.

194
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,600
Yes, sir. We'll work it out.

195
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,760
Please say no.

196
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,360
They barge in without notice 
and meddle in the evaluations.

197
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,520
This means they'll be intruding on 
our department going forward.

198
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,050
If we say yes now,

199
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,170
they'll try to boss us 
around later on.

200
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,310
It's Managing Director Ha's 
direct order.

201
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,470
We can't refuse right away.

202
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,300
For this event,

203
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,500
why don't we incorporate the 
Marketing Team's opinions?

204
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,110
It's Managing Director Ha's order,

205
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,200
so it'll be hard to convince 
them even with other terms.

206
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,470
If we're that easy-going, 
we'll get screwed.

207
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,670
We have to push hard 
when necessary.

208
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,020
Ms. Lee, it's good to 
express your opinions freely,

209
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,830
but please do mind your manners.

210
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,760
My apologies.

211
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,370
He already received the 
Chairman's approval.

212
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Since the Chairman is involved, 
we have no way around it.

213
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,030
Hyungnim used
 his brain this time.

214
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,590
Is there...

215
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,630
any way to bring this 
to our advantage?

216
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,820
Ms. Na.

217
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,040
Yes.

218
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,400
The product exhibition results.

219
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,600
Are you all right?

220
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,180
About what?

221
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,980
You and Ms. Lee 
seem to be at odds.

222
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,270
Opinions can clash 
during work at times.

223
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,310
After you review, call me
 if we need any edits.

224
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,860
The interior class will be conducted
 with the Marketing Team

225
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,240
on the day of the 
general managers meeting.

226
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,800
Mi Na, please take charge.

227
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,190
Yoo Ri, you assist her.

228
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,330
 Yes, ma'am. 

229
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,700
 

230
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,480
Why are you entering
 them one by one?

231
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,940
I was told to send a group 
text to the managers.

232
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,780
So why are you entering
 them one by one?

233
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,430
Sang Woo, seriously...

234
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,130
Do you still not know how to send
 web texts via our system?

235
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,560
Pardon?

236
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,980
Look.

237
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,790
Right here.

238
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,580
- There you go.
- Huh?

239
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,350
We had something like this?

240
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,120
From here...

241
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,760
Sang Woo.

242
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,380
Come to my office real quick.

243
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,320
Yes, sir.

244
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,840
I'll do it when I come back.

245
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,850
If it's urgent, I'll send them.

246
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,110
The texts?

247
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,970
Yes.

248
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,340
Yoo Ri, you know how?

249
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,540
Yes.

250
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,230
Better than you-know-who.

251
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,730
Here's the content. 
Compose and send.

252
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,110
Managers' contact info is stored
 in the company address book.

253
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,910
- Import from there.
- Yes, ma'am.

254
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,880
What did Young Joon say? You have to 
pack a lunch for his school picnic.

255
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,910
Mi Na.

256
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,770
Please don't do this.

257
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,800
Just come home, please?

258
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,570
I'll send you the ingredients
 and the instructions.

259
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,780
Don't forget and make it for him.

260
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,250
It's not easy making the 
characters, so practice ahead.

261
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,010
Forget it. I won't pack his lunch.

262
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,210
If you're so worried, 
you should take care of it.

263
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,270
This all seems like 
a joke to you, huh?

264
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,090
He's your child, too.

265
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,660
I did it every time, 
so you do it this time.

266
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,430
Man, seriously. I don't know
 what she's thinking.

267
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,500
Hey.

268
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,550
You've gotten so thin
 since I saw you last.

269
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,000
Is Jung Sun not 
feeding you properly?

270
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,190
That's not it.

271
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,640
I'm busy with work these days.

272
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,290
But you're holding onto 
your good looks.

273
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,490
Still handsome as ever.

274
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,670
No baby news yet?

275
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,030
No.

276
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,400
That's fine.

277
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,040
You're better off not having kids. 
What would you do with them?

278
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,920
It costs money, 
and it'll be a headache.

279
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,930
Look at me.

280
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,260
I have a daughter, 
but she treats me like...

281
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,520
How have you been?

282
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,570
You know me.

283
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm good, and then I'm not...

284
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm just getting by okay.

285
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,790
I heard you live in Daejeon
 after getting remarried.

286
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,600
That man drives me 
out of my mind.

287
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,120
I finally thought I was
 settling down,

288
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,410
but he's bitten by the
 "business bug."

289
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,570
Actually...

290
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,810
I have something to 
tell you regarding that.

291
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:10,143
Is there a way to see the
 entrance and exit records?

292
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,673
That's security.

293
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:14,223
It's impossible to view 
except for special reasons.

294
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:17,473
By chance, is there a 
problem of some sort?

295
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:20,083
No. I understand.

296
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:23,903
Hey, look who's here.

297
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:26,143
It's Deputy GM Na.

298
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:29,023
What on earth?

299
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:32,243
Why would the Marketing Team 
set the concierge manager meeting?

300
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,203
We have an upcoming 
collaboration event.

301
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:35,263
Collaboration?

302
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:37,203
Marketing Team and the
 Management Team?

303
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:39,683
There's no way Vice President 
would allow it.

304
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:43,393
What is it? Give me the details.

305
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:47,133
I sense something in the air.

306
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,123
And it's not good.

307
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,583
I'm getting a bad feeling.

308
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,453
Actually...

309
00:29:51,453 --> 00:29:52,943
Ji Young.

310
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:53,983
Yes.

311
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:57,513
Am I annoying, even 
from your perspective?

312
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:59,313
Of course, you are.

313
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,723
Hey, you have it all.

314
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,333
An awesome husband 
and your family's rich.

315
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,733
You work for fun, 
but you're successful.

316
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,533
Since you're worry-free, 
you're generous to others.

317
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:12,933
So others are generous back to you.

318
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,883
If you had a tough life, 
you couldn't do that.

319
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,263
The entire world gives
 you a warm reception.

320
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:21,243
So you have an elegant life, 
and of course, you're annoying.

321
00:30:22,763 --> 00:30:25,053
I didn't know I had it all.

322
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,093
Don't say that to anyone else.

323
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:30,303
Being humble about that
 is even more annoying.

324
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:32,003
Why?

325
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:34,243
Did someone say you're annoying?

326
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,713
They're jealous.

327
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:38,463
Lucky you.

328
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,503
I wish people would 
be jealous of my life.

329
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:55,873
Hello.

330
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,813
We were discussing the
 interior brand exhibition.

331
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:01,733
I see.

332
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:05,533
Song Mi Na, I guess
 you're in charge?

333
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,843
Yes.

334
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:08,563
That's good.

335
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:11,013
Get back to work then.

336
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:32,853
Why the long face?

337
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,313
IDs were shared within 
our team only,

338
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,223
so I think it's one of them.

339
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:44,063
But it doesn't make sense at all.

340
00:31:45,193 --> 00:31:47,813
Who on earth could've
 sent that text?

341
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:50,563
Is that important?

342
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:52,723
Yes, it's important.

343
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:55,033
If that person slips up,

344
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:57,443
it could cause trouble at work.

345
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,163
If that were so, it would've
 happened already.

346
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:05,053
Regardless, it's one 
of these three.

347
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:08,583
It's either a prank, 
a tip-off, or a threat.

348
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,013
If it's number one or two,

349
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,813
there wouldn't be any
 trouble of that kind.

350
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:15,053
As no actions have
 been taken so far,

351
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:17,203
I don't think it's a threat, either.

352
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,523
If it is, they'll crawl 
out on their own.

353
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,433
They'll demand 
something from you.

354
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,743
In a word,

355
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:30,373
it's not of any importance 
who the sender was.

356
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,573
If you have time to 
go digging around,

357
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:35,523
use it for a more productive cause.

358
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,393
I'm curious.

359
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:42,883
If they actually know something.

360
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:50,413
He said it's not anyone
 I know for sure, but...

361
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:55,413
If you don't feel confident,
 then forget it.

362
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,353
If you'll continue to be curious 
who's outside the door,

363
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,213
if you'll keep wondering if it's 
a mouse or an elephant,

364
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:04,503
you should stop.

365
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:09,183
Stop and just open the door.

366
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:11,353
Whether it's a mouse or an elephant,

367
00:33:11,353 --> 00:33:12,903
if you see it yourself,

368
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:16,933
you won't be delusional and turn
 a mouse into a tiger, at least.

369
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:21,643
If you don't feel confident 
about opening the door,

370
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:24,293
forget the door exists and go on.

371
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:29,313
Whatever it is,

372
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,363
you'll have to choose one...

373
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,333
for you to live.

374
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:57,283
 Stop and just open the door. 

375
00:33:57,283 --> 00:34:00,223
 If you don't feel confident
 about opening the door, 

376
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:03,063
 forget the door exists and go on. 

377
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,993
What are you doing there?

378
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,293
I can't open the door.

379
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:20,653
No, it's nothing.

380
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:35,873
What kind of a door is this?

381
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,383
It's vestibule.

382
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:39,503
The door right after 
the front entrance.

383
00:34:39,503 --> 00:34:40,663
That's it.

384
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,633
This blocks the outside air,

385
00:34:42,633 --> 00:34:45,583
and the smell from 
the shoe cabinets.

386
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,563
Aigoo, these aren't regular doors?

387
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:49,173
Why so many varieties?

388
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,933
The designs are 
sophisticated these days.

389
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,953
It makes the house 
seem bigger, too.

390
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:55,493
Aigoo...

391
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,363
- Here.
- Whoa...

392
00:35:01,363 --> 00:35:02,883
Sang Woo.

393
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,443
Help me set these up.

394
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:06,563
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,113
Wow, I'm scared already.

396
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:15,633
About what?

397
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:18,033
Mr. Park alone is scary as is.

398
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,763
but there are 20 people
 like Ms. Kang today.

399
00:35:20,763 --> 00:35:23,633
Sang Woo, you talk 
behind people's backs.

400
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:26,903
Why are you so startled? 
Did you see a ghost?

401
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:28,373
Nope.

402
00:35:28,373 --> 00:35:30,913
- Team Leader is calling for me.
- Oh, Team Leader?

403
00:35:30,913 --> 00:35:32,913
No, he's not.

404
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,173
He will be.

405
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,563
He's still a newbie. It's kind of cute.

406
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:42,253
- Why are you alone?
- They'll be here soon.

407
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,503
Yes, there they are.

408
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:56,333
 

409
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,783
We'll invite star interior 
designers for each market,

410
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,903
and hold interior classes for the VIPs.

411
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:06,803
Today, we're holding an orientation 
class for all the managers

412
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:08,873
to be trained beforehand.

413
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:10,603
So...

414
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:14,103
you're telling us to sell the products?

415
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:17,113
Isn't that what we do
 at department stores?

416
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:19,493
There will be incentives
 for your performance.

417
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:20,743
It's not a bad deal.

418
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,073
Sell products...

419
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,233
You're right.

420
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:25,373
Our job is to sell products.

421
00:36:25,373 --> 00:36:28,773
Ms. Oh, right here, was comforting
 a customer who got dumped last month,

422
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:32,633
and she played Go-stop with her after 
work and sold a 30 million won watch.

423
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,313
And Ms. Han right here.

424
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:36,473
She befriended a customer who
 came in alone every day,

425
00:36:36,473 --> 00:36:38,473
and sold her an 80 million won
 diamond set.

426
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:39,643
However,

427
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:42,043
the products never came first.

428
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:44,983
We ask, "How can we help you?"

429
00:36:44,983 --> 00:36:48,163
We don't say, "Don't you need this?"

430
00:36:48,163 --> 00:36:50,493
VIPs don't buy things they need.

431
00:36:50,493 --> 00:36:52,663
They purchase what they want.

432
00:36:52,663 --> 00:36:54,823
Unless they request 
personal services,

433
00:36:54,823 --> 00:36:56,653
selling specific types of products

434
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,423
goes against the VIPs' 
basic preferences.

435
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:01,183
Such trifling recommendations

436
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:05,393
could leave the impression they're 
being viewed as sales targets.

437
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,693
Without considering the
 basic preferences,

438
00:37:07,693 --> 00:37:09,633
this method of pushing for sales

439
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:13,063
is an "armchair theory" ignorant
 of what goes on site.

440
00:37:13,063 --> 00:37:14,823
"Armchair theory."

441
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,483
The company's policy is

442
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:22,083
set after conducting proper 
analysis and research.

443
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,153
Of all the managers present,

444
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:27,323
has any of you discussed
 this with the headquarters?

445
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,263
So what are you saying?

446
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:34,573
You'll ignore the 
headquarters' decision?

447
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:35,783
Yup.

448
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:36,973
What?

449
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:40,793
We can't follow one-sided orders
 which weren't discussed beforehand.

450
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:45,153
Furthermore, especially if that method 
will have a negative impact on site.

451
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:48,843
Are you saying you'll 
go on a strike?

452
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:51,273
Aren't you all contract employees?

453
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:54,063
We may just terminate 
your contracts.

454
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,493
General Manager.

455
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:57,673
I think there's a misunderstanding.

456
00:37:57,673 --> 00:38:00,503
A contract is made 
when both parties agree.

457
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:03,473
If an agreement is not 
reached, it can be terminated.

458
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:06,413
It's not entirely up to the
 company, though.

459
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:09,363
If you want,

460
00:38:09,363 --> 00:38:11,773
you can request the
 termination of our contracts.

461
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:12,693
However,

462
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:16,573
you'll have to re-hire all the concierge
 managers across the board.

463
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,853
Regarding the issue on hand,

464
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:28,043
we'll take into account your side.

465
00:38:28,043 --> 00:38:29,723
We'll review it again.

466
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:48,773
All right, then. We'll now...

467
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:52,903
have interior designer 
Ms. Jung Sae Young give her lecture.

468
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:05,853
Geez, I was dying of nerves.

469
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:07,283
You did well.

470
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:11,013
I was so nervous
 General Manager Jung will flip his lid.

471
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:14,343
I put my job on the line 
because I trust you guys.

472
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:17,593
For now, we should...

473
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:21,193
seem as if we're complying
 with the Marketing Team.

474
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,123
Why don't we let the managers resist?

475
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:28,013
There will be much 
backlash on site, too.

476
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:30,873
If the managers gather and 
show their objection,

477
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:34,203
it'll be hard for the 
Marketing Team to proceed.

478
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,673
If we guarantee their jobs, 
they'll unify as a group.

479
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:41,023
Once that happens, we'll have
 the upper hand again.

480
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,643
If I get fired, I have other places to go.

481
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:48,953
But other managers really put
 it on the line courageously.

482
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,173
Don't worry.

483
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:52,613
Mr. Jung won't want
 this to be his failure.

484
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:54,643
He'll want to cover it up.

485
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:58,463
It'll be difficult for him to 
reject our proposed Plan B.

486
00:39:58,463 --> 00:39:59,713
I see.

487
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:01,353
When I look at it,

488
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:03,493
you're the gutsiest b**** here.

489
00:40:04,943 --> 00:40:08,243
Ms. Kang. Manager Lee
 is looking for you.

490
00:40:08,243 --> 00:40:09,743
I must get going.

491
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:15,943
Can we talk for a minute?

492
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:22,243
As stated in class earlier, 
this model house is in line with

493
00:40:22,243 --> 00:40:24,773
"Glam Classic," one 
of this year's trends.

494
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:27,903
Overall, the walls are 
primarily done in wainscoting,

495
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:31,013
and the kitchen is accented
 in elegant white and gold.

496
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:33,083
Now feel free to look around.

497
00:40:34,273 --> 00:40:36,623
- Did you hear?
- About what?

498
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:39,793
Vice President's wife showed up 
at the Cheongdam branch recently.

499
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,493
Really? Did something happen?

500
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:43,313
I heard the Vice President's wife

501
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,963
- broke a display screen there.
- Really?

502
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,783
 The main point is... 

503
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,063
Take your time.

504
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:54,743
 1.2 million. 1.2 million won? 

505
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:12,383
What on earth?

506
00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:14,333
So Vice President's wife knows?

507
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:15,713
Is that it?

508
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:18,283
Hey.

509
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:21,263
Maybe we'll have an interesting 
happening soon, huh?

510
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:36,003
You're working hard.

511
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:37,073
Yes.

512
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:40,843
Do you have a minute right now?

513
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:45,933
Where is Mi Na?

514
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:48,233
She has the materials for
 the interior design, right?

515
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:50,233
Yes. That's...

516
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,373
So you want to join 
the Marketing Team.

517
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:02,023
I've heard.

518
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:06,183
If you were to join the 
Marketing Team,

519
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,643
it'd be a huge gain for us.

520
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,293
Thank you.

521
00:42:13,293 --> 00:42:14,933
But...

522
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,403
let's delay your transfer a bit.

523
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:21,023
Pardon?

524
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:23,723
Instead of transferring right away,

525
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:25,673
I think there's something you can do for us 
while you're on the Management Team.

526
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:29,273
you can do for us while you're 
on the Management Team.

527
00:42:31,473 --> 00:42:34,133
And what would that be?

528
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:36,073
Well...

529
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:38,773
let's see what transpires.

530
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,583
You just need to

531
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:43,963
stay on top of what's going on
 in the Management Team.

532
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:47,703
That information will be your strength.

533
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,643
No need to be so serious.

534
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,043
What?

535
00:42:57,043 --> 00:43:00,223
Do you feel iffy as if I'm
 asking you to betray them?

536
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:02,953
No, no.

537
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:06,173
Just relax.

538
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:09,733
I wouldn't ask you to do 
anything illegal, would I?

539
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:18,493
I thought we'd be a great match.

540
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:22,193
Do you need time to think?

541
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,053
No, sir.

542
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,363
I'll give it my all.

543
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:37,303
There you go.

544
00:43:38,473 --> 00:43:40,453
I knew you were a sharp one.

545
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,213
I had you pegged right.

546
00:43:56,173 --> 00:43:58,833
Take care of urgent matters with this.

547
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,283
You can take your time
 to pay me back.

548
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:04,723
They have low-interest 
loans for employees.

549
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:07,493
You probably don't know about such
 things since you never had to.

550
00:44:07,493 --> 00:44:10,233
If you get a loan, I'm sure 
you could find a place to live.

551
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:16,303
Don't use your money to pay off
 your mother's debt for now.

552
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:20,543
If the situation gets worse
 later on, you can do it then.

553
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:25,893
You have to survive first.

554
00:44:30,173 --> 00:44:31,603
You're right.

555
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:36,073
I...

556
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:40,003
suspected if Oppa was 
having an affair with you.

557
00:44:47,253 --> 00:44:49,443
Oppa said he had a woman.

558
00:44:56,123 --> 00:44:58,833
After I spit it out,
 it sounds so surreal.

559
00:45:02,323 --> 00:45:05,583
As you can see, I'm a mess
 as much as you are.

560
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:08,143
I'm not sure if that 
makes you feel better.

561
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:14,703
Perhaps I do have 
a "heroine syndrome,"

562
00:45:14,703 --> 00:45:17,863
but I'm concerned 
about you even now.

563
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:22,373
So I'm butting in when I shouldn't.

564
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,073
Don't say no.

565
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,833
I'm doing it for my own sake.

566
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:35,343
Why...

567
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:38,863
did you tell me?

568
00:45:41,953 --> 00:45:45,553
That woman could be me.

569
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:50,363
Is it you?

570
00:46:00,003 --> 00:46:03,713
I felt like going crazy if 
I didn't talk to someone.

571
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:07,843
Keeping it to myself 
was driving me insane.

572
00:46:07,843 --> 00:46:08,943
That's why I told you.

573
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:12,353
Even if it's you, nothing I can do.

574
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:17,983
But I hope it's not you.

575
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:22,993
I was able to say it 
because it's you.

576
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:42,923
Safe...

577
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,073
We're not strangers.

578
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:59,013
Shouldn't we at least say hello?

579
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:07,043
Hello...

580
00:47:12,203 --> 00:47:14,463
I'm happy.

581
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:17,613
At least, we're saying hi to each other.

582
00:47:34,243 --> 00:47:36,993
- Did you have dinner?
- No, I didn't.

583
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:38,483
Then would you like to join me?

584
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:40,233
Actually, I'm busy right now.

585
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,033
Actually, it'll be my treat.

586
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:46,033
I'm starving, but
 I don't want to eat alone.

587
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:49,313
If you'll volunteer your time
 for a co-worker...

588
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:52,453
I get indigestion when I eat
 dinner uncomfortably.

589
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,163
So that'll be difficult.

590
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,743
I'll eat alone then.

591
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,013
What the heck is Hyung up to?

592
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:43,843
Thank you.

593
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:47,063
You saved someone's life.

594
00:48:48,883 --> 00:48:52,203
- Did you tell Jung Sun...
- No, I didn't.

595
00:48:52,203 --> 00:48:54,183
Thank you.

596
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:58,453
I'm so ashamed right now.

597
00:48:58,453 --> 00:49:00,633
Next time, I'll have good news...

598
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,583
No.

599
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:06,983
It'd be best for me not to show up.

600
00:49:08,033 --> 00:49:11,233
"No news is good news."
 I'll live quietly.

601
00:49:14,263 --> 00:49:15,733
Mother-in-law.

602
00:49:18,693 --> 00:49:21,793
Do give Jung Sun a call 
from time to time.

603
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,543
Jung Sun...

604
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:27,053
will be thinking of you 
regardless of the reasons.

605
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:32,663
Okay.

606
00:49:32,663 --> 00:49:34,623
Go on.

607
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,313
You're a good man.

608
00:49:46,313 --> 00:49:49,383
Jung Sun may not 
have a good mother,

609
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:52,083
but she's blessed with 
a good husband.

610
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,033
Mother.

611
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:25,573
Yeah. Are you done with work?

612
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:29,593
What?

613
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:33,183
What are you talking about...

614
00:50:35,673 --> 00:50:37,243
Yeah, okay.

615
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:44,133
 

616
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,233
Ms. Na is out today 
for personal reasons.

617
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:54,073
Ms. Lee, please oversee any 
of Ms. Na's urgent work matters.

618
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:55,143
Yes, sir.

619
00:53:17,643 --> 00:53:19,703
I was able to accept it

620
00:53:19,703 --> 00:53:22,093
because it was Jung Sun.

621
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:24,483
 

622
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:25,643
Oppa.

623
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:28,403
Come to me.

624
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:30,383
I'll be good to you.

625
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:36,523
Frankly, I'm like winning
 a lotto, aren't I?

626
00:53:36,523 --> 00:53:38,383
And...

627
00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:41,063
you'll be the last man for me.

628
00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:42,773
Last.

629
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:44,923
Stop joking, and let's go in.

630
00:53:44,923 --> 00:53:46,213
I have to work.

631
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:55,753
But I'm not joking...

632
00:53:57,493 --> 00:53:59,113
Sung Joon oppa?

633
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:04,293
So...

634
00:54:04,293 --> 00:54:06,033
since when did you two...

635
00:54:07,233 --> 00:54:09,533
I wanted to tell you sooner,

636
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:11,553
but he's your college sunbae.

637
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:13,573
I didn't want to put him on the spot.

638
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:16,343
I didn't want to say it 
until things were certain.

639
00:54:18,763 --> 00:54:21,903
Are you upset that
 I'm telling you now?

640
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:27,353
Congrats.

641
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:29,953
I'm really happy for you.

642
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,783
I understood.

643
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:40,603
Because Jung Sun has...

644
00:54:40,603 --> 00:54:44,733
a loyal heart, per your words, Oppa.

645
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,253
And I thought...

646
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:51,233
you were the same.

647
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:56,003
Because...

648
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:59,533
you should be the same, Oppa.

649
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:04,453
- Hyun Ah...
- You should stop.

650
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,193
Before the point of no return.

651
00:56:49,983 --> 00:56:52,173
Why did I hide?

652
00:56:58,993 --> 00:57:01,133
I'll have to get it tomorrow.

653
00:57:22,463 --> 00:57:25,073
 

654
00:57:29,703 --> 00:57:31,003
Where are you?

655
00:57:31,003 --> 00:57:32,953
Where else? I'm home.

656
00:57:32,953 --> 00:57:35,633
 - What about Sung Joon oppa? 
- He's still at work.

657
00:57:37,143 --> 00:57:38,433
I see.

658
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:41,833
Actually, my mother-in-law is over.

659
00:57:41,863 --> 00:57:44,203
Okay, do your thing.

660
00:58:44,943 --> 00:58:46,933
 Oppa said he had a woman. 

661
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:18,043
♫  I'm wasting my time  ♫

662
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:20,853
 

663
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:23,553
♫  Seizing for the truth  ♫

664
00:59:23,553 --> 00:59:30,593
♫  But now we realize right, 
nothing's right  ♫

665
00:59:30,593 --> 00:59:37,933
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫

666
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:41,673
♫  Pretend to be fine, 
but nothing's right  ♫

667
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:47,393
♫  No lie  ♫

668
00:59:47,393 --> 00:59:50,153
 Tifóne's Chairman Daniel
 will pay us a visit. 

669
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,623
 - Are you all right?
- Chairman, are you okay? 

670
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,273
 Would I be okay if I get what I want? 

671
00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:57,403
 Wouldn't it be better than
 not getting what I want? 

672
00:59:57,403 --> 00:59:59,023
 I wish you'd tell me you're okay. 

673
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:00,043
 I have to know. 

674
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:02,983
 I must know about the woman 
you were involved with. 

675
01:00:02,983 --> 01:00:09,793
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫
