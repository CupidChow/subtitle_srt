1
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,630
 Park Sung Joon... 

2
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,690
 takes care of my 
husband's mistresses. 

3
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,730
 He's gotten rid of quite a few. 

4
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,870
 My husband... 

5
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,640
 has stocks under borrowed 
names to own more shares. 

6
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,470
 Mr. Park manages them for him. 

7
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,680
 Lee Soo Jung and Mr. Park 
own them as well. 

8
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,150
 

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,100
 

10
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,210
Did you have a nice visit 
to your mother's house?

11
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,270
Yeah.

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,970
Could you teach me how
 to drive sometime?

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
- Drive?
- I feel bad that...

14
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,450
Mr. Lee drives me to 
work every morning.

15
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,570
And I want to learn, too.

16
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,290
Okay, I'll teach you.

17
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,790
Should we go on a drive
 this weekend and...

18
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,380
 

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,600
 

20
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,270
 If you reveal... 

21
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,980
 both adultery and 
borrowed-name stocks, 

22
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,400
 Mr. Park and On Yoo Ri
 will both crumble. 

23
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,510
Ms. Na, we have a meeting.

24
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,040
Okay.

25
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Hello.

27
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,230
The event will be in the 
form of a fundraiser party

28
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,190
and the donations will be 
under the customers' names.

29
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,840
Yes?

30
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,580
A jewelry brand suggested an 
event for its new products recently.

31
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,090
I think it'd be good for this event.

32
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,450
Why don't we collaborate with them?

33
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,430
Our main goal is matchmaking,

34
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,200
and this product is popular
 among the young VIPs

35
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,300
for wedding purchases, too.

36
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,390
That sounds great!

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200
When VIPs get married,

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,400
brand managers are dying
 for excuses to call them.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm sure the brand would love that.

40
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,380
I think the VIPs would like that, too.

41
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,020
Sounds like a good idea.

42
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,710
Please share the 
documents from them.

43
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,120
- I'll look over them.
- Yes.

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
We'll need someone in charge
 if we do collaborate.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,050
How about letting Mi Na

46
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,750
take charge since she 
came up with the idea?

47
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,540
It's too big of a responsibility for

48
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,580
a regular staff, isn't it?

49
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,450
We have a lot of experience
 in collaborations.

50
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,590
Maybe the Marketing Team
 should be in charge.

51
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,290
The proposal came to the VIP 
Management Team, to begin with

52
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
and we have a lot of experience
 in collaborative events.

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,700
It should be fine. And Mi Na...

54
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,700
did a great job with 
Cha Se Rin's presentation, too.

55
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,830
Since it's larger in scale,

56
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,890
bigger the responsibility, too.

57
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,660
What do you think, Mi Na?

58
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,400
I'll give it a try.

59
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,130
Come up with detailed 
plans and send that along.

60
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes.

61
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,040
The PR materials for
 the Black Society...

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,110
The PR Team and Ms. Lee 
should work on that together.

63
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,790
- Yes.
- Sounds great!

64
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,370
That's all.

65
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,030
We're on a tight schedule.

66
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,240
Please work hard, everyone.

67
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,870
- Yes.
- Yes!

68
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,700
Mr. Cha.

69
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,620
Can we talk for a second?

70
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,990
Yes.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,100
I wasn't trying to show.

72
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,000
- Well...
- Do you want to...

73
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,690
have dinner at my place?

74
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,080
Your place?

75
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,480
Sounds great.

76
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,360
See you later then.

77
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,260
Yes.

78
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,560
The VIP Management Team is...

79
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,580
working on most tasks for the TF?

80
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,290
Yes.

81
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,230
Mr. Park is...

82
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,020
supposed to be the director
 for the Prestige Team.

83
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,990
It'd be nice if he lets us 
play an important role.

84
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,530
He's probably trying to be efficient 
since the VIP Management Team

85
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,820
has a lot of experience
 with the VIP events.

86
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,940
However, events never turn 
out the way you expected.

87
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,740
You come across many variables

88
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,780
and problems you 
never expected as well.

89
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,340
Right?

90
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,860
Yes.

91
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,120
- That's true.
- Yes.

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,030
 Ms. Ha. 

93
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,480
 There is a call for you. 

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,780
Who is it?

95
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,540
 Bae Do Il, the former director, 
wants to talk to you. 

96
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,740
Done.

97
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,770
I need Mr. Kim's help

98
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,760
so I could power through.

99
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,580
If I could be of help, 
of course, I should.

100
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,010
Aigoo, thank you.

101
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,460
- Here.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
 

103
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,400
Okay, let's drink.

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
Excuse me for a moment.

105
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,110
Okay.

106
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,880
Let's drink on our own.

107
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,110
Yes.

108
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,750
Have you had dinner?

109
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,030
Do you want to eat 
together if you haven't?

110
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,280
I'm having dinner with the VP.

111
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,900
Oh, is that so?

112
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,340
 Sorry. 

113
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,900
Get some rest.

114
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,790
Was that Ms. Na?

115
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,980
Everyone says you're 
a pair of lovebirds.

116
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,080
They must still be in
 the honeymoon phase.

117
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,430
Not at all.

118
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,620
Let's have another round.

119
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,140
- Yes.
- Thank you.

120
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,700
To be honest, I wanted
 to see you all

121
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,590
because I have 
something to tell you.

122
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,290
I don't think the chairman
 should decide

123
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,280
who'll become the president
 based on his personal opinion.

124
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,100
Whoever knows the store 
best should be in that position.

125
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,820
I'm considering another 
shareholders' meeting.

126
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,970
I saw it already.

127
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,640
You definitely take after your dad.

128
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,050
Me?

129
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,360
What about me? What?

130
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,510
Is that a good thing?

131
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,620
Mom, were you a good student?

132
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,130
Yes, I was a good student.

133
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,820
Mom apparently was 
at the top of her class.

134
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,730
She was an excellent student.

135
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,930
Wow! You're totally a genius then!

136
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,960
Why did you marry Dad then?

137
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,050
What?

138
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,560
Hey, I was a good student, too.

139
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,950
Were you at the top 
of the class, too?

140
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,320
No, I wasn't.

141
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,100
Wow, are you the best 
at your workplace then?

142
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,250
Of course.

143
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,830
She's the best at work, too.

144
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,220
She just took on another 
very important task.

145
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,690
- Really?
- Yes.

146
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll brag about it to my friends!

147
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
- I'll brag, too!
- That's right!

148
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,300
- Dad, look!
- Dad, look!

149
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,120
Our kids only brag 
about their mom.

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,200
It's no good. I'll make a list for me

151
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,870
and make them memorize it.

152
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,500
You know, right? I made the rice 
cakes for our sons' first birthday.

153
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,490
Thank you.

154
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,560
"Why did you marry Dad?"

155
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,610
Hey!

156
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,310
Forget about everything
 else about this place.

157
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,530
But it has an amazing night view.

158
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,610
It's really pretty.

159
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,690
You know about Jung Sun and

160
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,230
Sung Joon, right?

161
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,920
What is Sung Joon oppa

162
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,490
thinking anyway?

163
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,820
I'm not sure either.

164
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,790
I don't know what he's thinking.

165
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,910
I've known those two

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,100
since they started dating.

167
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
I had no idea they would

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
break up like this.

169
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,070
I know.

170
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,790
I thought those two

171
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,900
would never break up.

172
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,300
I...

173
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,560
believe eternal love
 is just a fantasy.

174
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,300
But they were the only 
couple that made me think,

175
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,890
"Yes, there are relationships
 like that, too."

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
They used to make me think that.

177
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
But the fact that it ended

178
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,900
makes me feel bitter.

179
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,700
It's...

180
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,660
a bit sad, too.

181
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,910
Perhaps I sneered at 
the idea of eternal love

182
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,300
but hoped for it to exist 
at the same time.

183
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,080
- Staying up late?
- Yes, go to bed first.

184
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,710
Take it easy.

185
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,700
I should finish it well 
since it's my last project.

186
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,960
If I were an employer,

187
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,450
I'd definitely hire
 someone like you.

188
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,570
There's no employee like you!

189
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,610
Come to bed soon.

190
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,570
Sir.

191
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,160
Shall I call a cab for you?

192
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
- Yes, thank you. 
- Sure.

193
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,900
I'll call one right away.

194
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,450
 

195
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,880
Hello?

196
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,260
Sir, where should I take you?

197
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,890
Sir!

198
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,040
After the Task Force project ends,

199
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm thinking of sending 
you abroad to study.

200
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,460
While you're studying,

201
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,610
I'll send Mr. Park to the
 U.S. branch, too.

202
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,190
But stop seeing him until then.

203
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,570
Until his divorce procedure ends,

204
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,400
your relationship is
 adultery, after all.

205
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,620
I'll say this again.

206
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,250
The situation is not 
good right now.

207
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,330
We can't afford a scandal.

208
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Everything I've laid out for you...

209
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,530
Haven't I compromised enough?

210
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,820
 

211
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,280
Sir.

212
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,780
Sir! We're here.

213
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,730
- Thank you.
- Sure.

214
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
 

215
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
Thank you so much.

216
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
 

217
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,330
We haven't even 
started unpacking,

218
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,820
but I'm already getting sick.

219
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,080
All right.

220
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,370
How does it feel to move
 into your newlywed home,

221
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,790
Mr. Park Sung Joon?

222
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,490
I'm very happy.

223
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,520
You know there are families

224
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,910
that fight with each other

225
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,900
but are supportive 
when times are difficult.

226
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,730
Ordinary families like
 that, you know?

227
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,170
I've always wanted 
to have a family

228
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,680
like that when I get married.

229
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,710
In this house, we'll fight, make up

230
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,860
and have children, too.

231
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,530
We'll become a family
 like that, right?

232
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,330
I'm glad...

233
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,430
that you're my husband.

234
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,290
I'm the one who should be glad.

235
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,900
Let's live happily together 
until our hair turns gray.

236
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,430
Mr. Park Sung Joon.

237
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,810
I think I gave the wrong 
address to the taxi driver.

238
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,660
I drank quite a bit.

239
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,970
Please leave.

240
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,180
This isn't a place for 
you any longer.

241
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,740
I...

242
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,170
thought you weren't 
a bad person, at the least.

243
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,070
But I don't know what
 kind of a person

244
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,770
you are anymore.

245
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,290
 

246
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,170
 Hello? 

247
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,760
Isn't this Mr. Park Sung Joon's phone?

248
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,900
 Do you know the owner of this phone? 

249
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,530
 He left his phone in a taxi. 

250
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,590
Where are you now? 
I'll go pick it up.

251
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,050
 I'm around Hannamdong, 
where I just dropped him off. 

252
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,120
Hannamdong?

253
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,430
Welcome.

254
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,870
Hello.

255
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,700
Why does my tummy 
hurt all of a sudden?

256
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,200
Welcome.

257
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,610
Hello.

258
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,920
You're Ha Yoo Ri, right?

259
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,890
- Yes.
- I'm Kim Min Ki.

260
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,210
I heard a lot about you.

261
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,270
Yes.

262
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,230
What's with this picture?

263
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,720
Kim Min Ki from 
T.O. Group just entered.

264
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,620
Please set up an
 extra table back there.

265
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,580
Yes, sir.

266
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,550
Please do it right now.

267
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,550
Ma Sang Woo.

268
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,740
Where are you going?

269
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,990
Why are you hiding?

270
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,000
Well...

271
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,600
- I wasn't really hiding.
- Why?

272
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,300
Worried that it will be revealed that 
you're the minister's son?

273
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,760
Right now, you're 
Ma Sang Woo, an employee.

274
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,100
So let's go in and work.

275
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,220
It's impossible to keep 
a secret in this company!

276
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,790
Have you seen this?

277
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,310
Don't you love their songs?

278
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,320
I know!

279
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,130
I love them.

280
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,990
Should I have them 
at the year-end party?

281
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,990
Really?

282
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,520
- Can you do that?
- I'll talk to the manager.

283
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Daebak.

284
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,810
You'd better invite me.

285
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,020
You're always all talk.

286
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,990
I got it. Geez.

287
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Isn't she the one
 people talk about?

288
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,660
Whoa, she cleaned up 
pretty well already.

289
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,830
She's totally my type
 looking like that.

290
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,870
Why don't you go
 seduce her then?

291
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,310
She may have gotten
 rid of her tacky style,

292
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,190
but being a high school grad and
 illegitimate will never change.

293
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,160
I guess that's true.

294
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,230
I know it's true.

295
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,900
She'll always be vulgar.

296
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Right.

297
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,670
They're busy checking
 each other out.

298
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,200
Isn't that cute?

299
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,390
I used to be like that, too.

300
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,040
When you marry for love,

301
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,930
you learn that love
 isn't everything.

302
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,970
When you marry 
for the credentials,

303
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,320
you learn that the 
credentials aren't everything.

304
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,460
That's marriage.

305
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,170
How far will you take it?

306
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,210
Pardon?

307
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,130
Your battle with Mr. Park.

308
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,790
I wish you'd take it 
all the way, Ms. Na.

309
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,480
Where do you think it'll end up?

310
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,930
Anyway, something interesting
 will happen soon.

311
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,470
Could you switch the placement
 of this set and that one?

312
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,160
Yes, I will.

313
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,540
Is the display going well?

314
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,620
Yes.

315
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,010
Thank you.

316
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,150
I can't...

317
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,110
look you in the eye right now.

318
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,210
He's not the kind 
of person who'd do this.

319
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,550
How could he...

320
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,990
Jung Sun.

321
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,310
I'll scold him real good 
and make him change.

322
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:40,600
Could you please forgive
 him just one time?

323
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm sorry, Mother.

324
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,070
He and I can't be together.

325
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,300
It's over.

326
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,960
- Please, Jung Sun...
- Please don't...

327
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,560
I apologize on his behalf.

328
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,980
I'll beg you right now.

329
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Don't do this, Mother.

330
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,900
- Get up. 
- This is all my fault.

331
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,520
I'm sorry.

332
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,750
I'm so sorry.

333
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,370
He...

334
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,480
He shouldn't have done that.

335
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,040
He shouldn't have 
done such a thing.

336
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,270
That's not your fault.

337
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,390
Please get up.

338
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,510
This is my karma.

339
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,710
I should've lived the right way.

340
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,890
This happened to you two
 because I lived wrongly.

341
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,960
It's not your fault, Mother.

342
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,430
It...

343
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,320
It just happened that way.

344
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,670
So...

345
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,550
Please don't do this. 
Please get up.

346
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,050
No, it's all my fault.

347
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,540
It's because I raised him!

348
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,680
It's because a mistress 
like me raised him!

349
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,830
I deserve to die.

350
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,790
I deserve to die!

351
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:14,394
He said he wouldn't
 live like his father.

352
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:19,334
He used to say he'd 
live differently.

353
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:28,244
All of this is my fault.

354
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,134
I'll leave it to you.

355
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,174
Is the Matching Room all set up?

356
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:18,534
Yes.

357
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,634
We'll get started in 30 minutes.

358
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:21,694
Okay.

359
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,944
By the way...

360
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,354
let's talk after the event tonight.

361
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:32,164
I have something to say.

362
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:35,864
Okay.

363
00:32:54,924 --> 00:32:58,054
Mr. Park, we'll start the 
catering service now.

364
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,444
Okay.

365
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:03,154
Would you like to grab dinner...

366
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:05,484
with me after the event?

367
00:33:07,034 --> 00:33:10,194
Well, depending on how it goes.

368
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:12,344
I'm not sure how it'd go.

369
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:42,724
Did you find your phone?

370
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:44,014
What?

371
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:51,244
Well, yes.

372
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,744
How did you know 
that I lost my phone?

373
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:56,744
I called you last night

374
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,004
and heard that you left it in a taxi.

375
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,654
You must've drunk a lot.

376
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:04,624
Yes, I overdid it a bit.

377
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:10,694
Did you go straight 
home afterward?

378
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:17,784
Yes.

379
00:34:42,364 --> 00:34:44,294
Ma Sang Woo?

380
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:45,754
What the heck?

381
00:34:45,754 --> 00:34:47,434
I heard you got a job.

382
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:49,394
Are you running chores
 at a department store?

383
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:51,304
Yes.

384
00:34:53,284 --> 00:34:54,744
Yes, keep at it.

385
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:57,954
The company succeeds
 when employees work hard.

386
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:13,614
I'll take you to the second floor.

387
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:57,554
Mr. Kim Min Sung is going in now.

388
00:35:57,554 --> 00:36:00,944
Wow, I always wondered 
why they call her Midas Song.

389
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:02,414
She's quite amazing.

390
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:06,484
They're having a meeting
 behind closed doors.

391
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:08,504
This is good...

392
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,844
Stop eating.

393
00:36:10,844 --> 00:36:13,654
What? I won't even 
put a dent in it.

394
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:20,564
What do you think they 
talk about anyway?

395
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:23,714
"Our family owns a hotel. 
What does your family own?"

396
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,634
"My goodness, we own 
a department store!

397
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,384
We're meant to be!"

398
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:30,054
- Something like that?
- Probably not.

399
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:33,564
These people think it's
 vulgar to be direct.

400
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:36,894
So you know your stuff, huh?

401
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,324
Where does the 
donation go to anyway?

402
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,674
It hasn't been decided yet.

403
00:36:41,674 --> 00:36:43,134
They'll decide after the event.

404
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,634
Oh, I see.

405
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:48,734
Where's Manager Ha Yoo Ri?

406
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:51,634
The Prestige Team is 
probably in the hall.

407
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,124
He wants to meet me?

408
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:07,714
I think you left an impression 
on Mr. Kim Min Ki.

409
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,924
I don't think I should be there...

410
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:14,994
It'd be hard for me to step 
away. Please explain it to him.

411
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,914
You'd be talking casually.

412
00:37:16,914 --> 00:37:19,784
Don't feel pressured. 
Why don't you just meet him?

413
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:24,134
Turning him down now 
might hurt the VIP's feelings.

414
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:26,264
Isn't making this 
a successful event

415
00:37:26,264 --> 00:37:28,734
one of your goals, Yoo Ri?

416
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,954
To be honest,

417
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:34,494
if you only consider
 objective standards,

418
00:37:34,494 --> 00:37:39,164
T.O. Group's Kim Min Ki
 is out of your league.

419
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:45,304
This would be a good 
opportunity for you, too.

420
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:02,764
Please stop serving
 alcohol to Mr. Han.

421
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:03,744
Pardon?

422
00:38:03,744 --> 00:38:06,864
Nobody knows this yet, 
but he has an alcohol problem.

423
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:10,034
Prepare non-alcoholic 
drinks as an alternative.

424
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,774
Yes, got it.

425
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,024
 You come across 
many variables 

426
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:23,444
 and problems you 
never expected as well. 

427
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,544
Excuse me.

428
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,764
Yes.

429
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,544
Mr. Han Jong Il 
apparently likes whiskey.

430
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,064
Please makes sure 
he doesn't run out of it.

431
00:38:35,064 --> 00:38:36,144
Yes.

432
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,244
You came.

433
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:06,444
I'm sorry if I put you in a spot.

434
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,844
No worries.

435
00:39:09,594 --> 00:39:11,954
Don't you find this 
setting awkward?

436
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:13,964
I find it a bit awkward myself.

437
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:19,064
I was a bit surprised.

438
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:21,464
That you wanted to see me.

439
00:39:21,464 --> 00:39:23,474
You seemed different.

440
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,334
Honestly, at places like this,

441
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:30,004
you don't talk about real things.

442
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:33,474
It feels like we're 
all wearing masks.

443
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:36,984
But I thought you'd be different.

444
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:39,664
That's why I wanted 
to talk to you.

445
00:39:41,544 --> 00:39:43,754
Isn't it difficult working 
in this field?

446
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:47,184
No, it's okay.

447
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:51,214
If you're thirsty,

448
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:53,234
should I get you 
something to drink?

449
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,194
Right.

450
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:00,864
They're friends I've 
known since I was a kid.

451
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,934
Say hello. This is Ha Yoo Ri.

452
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,534
Nice to meet you.

453
00:40:05,554 --> 00:40:07,364
I've heard a lot about you.

454
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,564
Have a seat.

455
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:17,424
Min Ki hyung.

456
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,634
You always blow us off. 
What's up?

457
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,134
- You never want to hang out with us.
- I know.

458
00:40:22,144 --> 00:40:23,844
- I'm a bit disappointed.
- Come on.

459
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:25,324
You're all just saying that.

460
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:27,934
Right, what are you 
doing next Friday, Yoo Ri?

461
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:30,814
We're planning to 
have a year-end party.

462
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:32,614
Please come if you have time.

463
00:40:34,494 --> 00:40:36,934
Yes, I'll see if I can.

464
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,204
Yes.

465
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,434
Your grandfather is...

466
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:43,374
in good health, right?

467
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:45,634
Yes, he is.

468
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:47,834
Here.

469
00:40:59,034 --> 00:41:01,124
You came.

470
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,184
Where's Jae Woong?

471
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:05,934
He's running late 
because of a meeting.

472
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:08,584
I wonder what the 
meeting is about.

473
00:41:08,584 --> 00:41:11,044
Could it be about 
dragging me down?

474
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:17,984
Tae Young, it looks like
 you're enjoying all this.

475
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:09,124
I'm sorry to bother you.

476
00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:11,364
I have a question I wanted to ask.

477
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:33,564
What are you planning
 to do in the future?

478
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:41,864
Can't you divorce him?

479
00:42:43,544 --> 00:42:45,474
You two are finished anyway.

480
00:42:46,484 --> 00:42:48,234
Please...

481
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,314
divorce him.

482
00:42:52,184 --> 00:42:54,104
 Ms. Na, you have no idea. 

483
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,794
 The real reason he's hurting. 

484
00:42:56,794 --> 00:42:58,714
 You don't know, Ms. Na. 

485
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,424
Don't come to me again 
with stuff like this.

486
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:11,874
It's none of your business.

487
00:44:01,434 --> 00:44:04,164
Ms. Na has no intention to
 get divorced, does she?

488
00:44:06,014 --> 00:44:07,574
What should we do then?

489
00:44:09,224 --> 00:44:11,504
If Ms. Na doesn't divorce you,

490
00:44:11,504 --> 00:44:13,104
what would we do?

491
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:17,544
- Yoo Ri.
- Father told me to study abroad with you.

492
00:44:17,544 --> 00:44:19,084
We...

493
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:21,924
can get a fresh start 
where no one knows us.

494
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:24,444
Ms. Na needs to divorce 
you for that to happen!

495
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,044
Yoo Ri.

496
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:35,164
I'll talk to her later.

497
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,344
Are you okay with this?

498
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:41,384
We still can't...

499
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:44,124
even see each other properly.

500
00:44:44,124 --> 00:44:46,434
Are you okay with that, Sung Joon?

501
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:55,424
I don't want that anymore.

502
00:45:15,894 --> 00:45:17,954
I'd like to try this on.

503
00:45:17,954 --> 00:45:18,884
Yes.

504
00:45:24,934 --> 00:45:26,034
One moment, please.

505
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:33,244
The diamonds have special
 cuts, so they shine more.

506
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:34,954
It's so pretty.

507
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,534
I'll take this one.

508
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,734
Yes, I'll have the clerk 
help you with ordering.

509
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,424
How's it going?

510
00:45:50,424 --> 00:45:53,714
I received seven orders 
for just necklaces today!

511
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,064
Are you that happy?

512
00:45:57,064 --> 00:45:59,844
I planned, curated, and displayed 
everything from the beginning.

513
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:01,444
And it seems to be working.

514
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:02,994
I'm happy!

515
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,404
You did great.

516
00:46:06,674 --> 00:46:08,874
- You can go now. Carry on.
- Yes.

517
00:46:08,874 --> 00:46:10,744
Carry on.

518
00:46:23,544 --> 00:46:25,924
- Ms. Na!
- Yes.

519
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:27,764
The VP's car just arrived.

520
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:57,534
Here's the total amount of 
donations we received today.

521
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:05,994
You did a great job 
with the event today.

522
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:07,554
You're good.

523
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:09,044
Just as I expected.

524
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:22,834
I'd like to thank everyone 
for joining us for the

525
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:25,034
commencement of
 the Black Society

526
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:26,754
fundraising event.

527
00:47:26,754 --> 00:47:30,334
Sung Un Department store 
will try our best to introduce

528
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:32,524
new lifestyles,

529
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:36,074
beyond just a 
shopping experience.

530
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:44,354
The donations you 
gave us so generously

531
00:47:44,354 --> 00:47:46,824
will be handed over 
to LN Foundation

532
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:48,944
and be used for helping

533
00:47:48,944 --> 00:47:51,284
children from third 
world countries.

534
00:47:55,234 --> 00:47:58,934
And now, please welcome
 Chairwoman Lee Soo Jung

535
00:47:58,964 --> 00:48:01,194
of LN Foundation to 
receive the donation.

536
00:48:12,214 --> 00:48:13,724
Hello.

537
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,154
I'm Lee Soo Jung from
 the LN Foundation.

538
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:25,014
I'd like to thank everyone 
from the bottom of my heart

539
00:48:25,014 --> 00:48:27,574
for making this such
 a special event.

540
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:31,904
I'll make sure to deliver
 these heartfelt donations

541
00:48:31,904 --> 00:48:34,184
to the children who are

542
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:37,734
facing difficulties to be 
used in a meaningful way.

543
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:39,424
Thank you.

544
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,824
What happened?

545
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,844
Bring Soo Jung to me as 
soon as she gets off stage.

546
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,354
Yes, sir.

547
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:12,854
It looks like it'd be 
tough to talk tonight.

548
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:15,034
Let's do it some other time.

549
00:49:41,764 --> 00:49:44,414
Even if he calls you, 
don't answer it.

550
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,794
I'll take care of the aftermath.

551
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:53,644
Use this money

552
00:49:53,644 --> 00:49:55,854
to travel abroad for a while.

553
00:49:56,964 --> 00:49:58,364
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:07,954
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

555
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,554
With you on my side,

556
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,214
I feel like I gained a whole army.

557
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:19,314
I didn't do that to make you happy.

558
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:22,854
You might as well...

559
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,224
use this opportunity 
to tame Jae Woong.

560
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:44,234
Did you have a good 
meeting with Kim Min Ki?

561
00:50:45,324 --> 00:50:46,994
Well, yes.

562
00:50:47,034 --> 00:50:48,034
How was it?

563
00:50:48,934 --> 00:50:50,734
He's a nice person.

564
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:58,424
Isn't it so sad?

565
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:02,564
No matter how hard 
these people work,

566
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:06,164
they'll never get to live like
 the people in that world.

567
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:09,224
You have amazing luck.

568
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:10,964
If I were you,

569
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:14,254
I wouldn't let go 
of that opportunity.

570
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:49,814
What's this?

571
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:51,874
Hey, give it to me.

572
00:51:51,874 --> 00:51:53,304
Give it to me!

573
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:55,264
Give me alcohol!

574
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:03,234
Stop drinking. 
You're already drunk.

575
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:04,344
Hey...

576
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:05,594
Hey!

577
00:52:05,594 --> 00:52:07,094
I'm a VIP.

578
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,064
How dare you challenge a customer? 
You're an employee.

579
00:52:11,714 --> 00:52:12,774
Yes.

580
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:15,334
You're very drunk. 
Please call it a day today.

581
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:16,994
I'm not drunk.

582
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:18,854
So give me another glass.

583
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:20,244
You're very drunk, sir.

584
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:22,124
- Let's go.
- Seriously!

585
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:24,864
Excuse me.

586
00:52:24,864 --> 00:52:26,854
I'm not drunk.

587
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:28,404
I'll just drink one more glass.

588
00:52:28,404 --> 00:52:31,004
- Sir, you're very drunk.
- I said, I'm okay!

589
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:32,524
I'll take you home, sir.

590
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,754
I'm not drunk! Seriously...

591
00:52:34,754 --> 00:52:35,894
Sang Woo!

592
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:37,664
Sir, sir.

593
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:38,874
Sir.

594
00:52:38,874 --> 00:52:40,504
The event is ending soon.

595
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:42,854
I'll get you a car and 
drive you home.

596
00:52:44,534 --> 00:52:47,434
Sung Un Department 
Store is no good.

597
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:49,464
The service is horrible.

598
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,234
What's your name, miss?

599
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:55,134
- I'm the VIP Management...
- I'll tell my mom and...

600
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:57,334
- Enough is enough.
- Sang Woo.

601
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,634
Stop giving me orders!

602
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:02,034
I asked what your name was.

603
00:53:02,034 --> 00:53:03,634
- Sang Woo, Sang Woo!
- Leave!

604
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,164
You bastard.

605
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:11,634
Sir!

606
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:13,034
Sir...

607
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:19,394
Ms. Na!

608
00:53:21,754 --> 00:53:22,744
Ms. Na.

609
00:53:22,744 --> 00:53:24,744
Ms. Na, wake up. Ms. Na!

610
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:26,364
Ms. Na, Ms. Na...

611
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:28,494
Ms. Na, please wake up!

612
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:29,734
Ms. Na!

613
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:31,234
Ms. Na, Ms. Na, Ms. Na!

614
00:53:31,234 --> 00:53:32,934
- Wake up, Ms. Na!
- Jung Sun.

615
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:34,274
- Ms. Na!
- Jung Sun!

616
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,614
Jung Sun.

617
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,904
Wake up, Jung Sun!

618
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:40,254
Wake up.

619
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:41,434
Jung Sun!

620
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:42,894
Jung Sun!

621
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,514
Call 911.

622
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:46,104
Call 911 right now!

623
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:47,704
Yes!

624
00:53:47,704 --> 00:53:49,624
- Jung Sun!
- What should we do?

625
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:50,884
Jung Sun!

626
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,334
What happened?

627
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:55,934
I asked you what happened!

628
00:53:57,824 --> 00:53:59,264
Jung Sun.

629
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:01,304
Jung Sun, wake up.

630
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:02,834
Jung Sun!

631
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,334
Jung Sun, wake up.

632
00:54:05,334 --> 00:54:06,634
Geez...

633
00:54:06,684 --> 00:54:07,924
Jung Sun.

634
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:10,254
Wake up. Jung Sun!

635
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:24,034
Only one guardian can get in.

636
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:25,534
I'll come. I'm her husband.

637
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:26,704
Get in.

638
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:51,594
It'll be okay.

639
00:54:51,594 --> 00:54:53,624
It'll be okay, Jung Sun.

640
00:54:55,104 --> 00:54:56,374
It'll be okay.

641
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,374
It'll be okay.

642
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:14,534
How embarrassing for you.

643
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:35,844
She has slight internal bleeding,

644
00:55:35,844 --> 00:55:37,634
but thankfully, 
she won't need surgery.

645
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:39,384
We'll see how she recovers.

646
00:55:40,394 --> 00:55:41,824
Thank you.

647
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,934
 

648
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:16,754
Are you up?

649
00:58:16,754 --> 00:58:17,794
Yes.

650
00:58:22,764 --> 00:58:24,644
Are you okay?

651
00:58:24,644 --> 00:58:26,694
Yes, I'm okay.

652
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:30,984
Father will be here.

653
00:58:30,984 --> 00:58:32,544
He was on a business trip abroad,

654
00:58:32,544 --> 00:58:34,124
but he's coming back today.

655
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:36,044
He was very shocked.

656
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,634
Sung Joon.

657
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:51,874
Let's call it quits.

658
00:58:58,364 --> 00:59:00,094
Let's stop doing this.

659
00:59:00,094 --> 00:59:06,324
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

660
00:59:07,954 --> 00:59:14,504
♫  Set me free from 
this madness  ♫

661
00:59:14,504 --> 00:59:17,334
 

662
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:21,034
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

663
00:59:21,034 --> 00:59:28,704
♫  Set me free from 
your cold stare  ♫

664
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:35,744
♫  Set me free from 
these nightmares  ♫

665
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:44,414
♫  From the memories 
which have faded  ♫

666
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,094
 Was it really worth it for you? 

667
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:48,414
 So do you like it? 

668
00:59:48,414 --> 00:59:49,604
 That's why I warned you! 

669
00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:51,034
 Choose Mr. Park if you want. 

670
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,534
 But you'll be leaving 
as On Yoo Ri then. 

671
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:55,734
 You know what? You always look
 sad whenever you're with me. 

672
00:59:55,734 --> 00:59:58,034
 I should've made the decision 
when I kept my distance. 

673
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,034
 But when I realized that, I was 
already far from the boundary. 

674
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:04,334
 Did I really, did we 
understand each other? 

675
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:09,734
♫  Even though I say it 
without making a sound  ♫
