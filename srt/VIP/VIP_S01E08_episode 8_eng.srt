1
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:42,244
Look, it comes out so good.

2
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:44,574
We'll set the channel to number three.

3
00:00:45,674 --> 00:00:47,684
This is why we hire newbies.

4
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:50,314
So we can see their 
unabashed innocence,

5
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:52,574
as we reflect on our past and smile.

6
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,234
The company's small 
consideration for us.

7
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,364
Aren't those all luxury brands?

8
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:03,654
Hello.

9
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,464
You know how to wear this, right?

10
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:08,664
- Yes.
- The channel is set already.

11
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,084
Thank you.

12
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:08,144
We open the doors in one hour.

13
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,304
Let's hurry and set everything.

14
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,444
 Yes, sir. 

15
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:15,684
20% surplus for the catering. 
That should be fine, right?

16
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:17,614
Yes.

17
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,914
Keep filling up the 
empty wine glasses.

18
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:22,594
- More alcohol equals more sales.
- Yes, ma'am.

19
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:24,474
Let me see the checklist.

20
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,854
You should grab her by the hair.

21
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:32,344
That seems more human.

22
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,324
But it's not for certain.

23
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,804
What should we do?

24
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:45,714
One of the wine bottles
 has been "corked."

25
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:49,134
 

26
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:58,574
What are the chances of 
other wines being corked?

27
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:01,144
These wines are vintage 
and hard to take care of.

28
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:03,604
If storage was the problem 
for some of them,

29
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:06,054
we'd only know if we open them.

30
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:08,394
For now, check as you open them.

31
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:11,034
If you find corked wines, 
discard them right away.

32
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:12,344
Yes, ma'am.

33
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,184
How much surplus 
wine do we have?

34
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:16,074
About ten bottles.

35
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:18,744
Wine consumption increases
 toward the latter half.

36
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,944
Don't you know we need more 
surplus of wine than food?

37
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:25,794
It's a rare vintage to locate 
domestically. I acquired what I could.

38
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,284
I thought ten surplus bottles would be 
okay compared to the other events.

39
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:30,504
My apologies.

40
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,004
I'll source expensive wines 
to add to our surplus.

41
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,174
We're serving a large amount here.

42
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:39,024
You should've selected a wine 
that's easily accessible, not rare.

43
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:42,384
If we station different wines per
 table, the customers will complain.

44
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:43,624
What will you do?

45
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:50,444
Reserve the surplus according
 to the table numbers.

46
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:53,584
If we bring out the new wine, 
switch out all the tables.

47
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,984
Yes, will do.

48
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,594
If we make a mistake today...

49
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:03,664
we'll die.

50
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:05,794
She is human.

51
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:12,164
 

52
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:33,364
Diplomat Ma and his wife are here.

53
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,634
Did you have a pleasant trip here?

54
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:40,374
Thanks to you, it was pleasant.

55
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,814
I see you lack lower-body strength.

56
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:51,014
Thank you for your concern.

57
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:52,964
You should exercise a lot.

58
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:56,284
It's an important matter, but 
I can't really explain it to him.

59
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:58,684
Oh, Honey. Stop it and let's go in.

60
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,114
This way, please.

61
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:14,444
Sung Un Department Store's VP 
Ha Jae Woong and the missus are here.

62
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,144
Thanks for your hard work.

63
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,334
- Here.
- Yes.

64
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,064
Yoo Ri.

65
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,334
 Sang Woo and I can 
handle the entrance. 

66
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,794
 Watch the stage back door. 

67
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:29,914
Right this way.

68
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,974
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,434
Careful, please.

70
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,864
I reserved surplus wine.

71
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:53,824
They'll arrive before 1 p.m. 
We won't have a shortage.

72
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:54,734
Okay.

73
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:00,034
I'm sorry to make an error 
on an important day...

74
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:01,704
How long will you stand here?

75
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,804
Go double check on things instead.

76
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:08,354
No more mistakes.

77
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,014
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,604
CEO Park Do Chang is back.

79
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,174
Excuse me.

80
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,414
- VIPs are not to be photographed.
- Ms. Lee.

81
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,014
We're only photographing the 
Management Team. No need to worry...

82
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:33,794
VIPs do not like being photographed.

83
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,984
Regardless, the cameras 
being present is an issue.

84
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,784
Keep it exclusive to the backstage.

85
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,434
- Put the camera away.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:48,534
My, who is this?

87
00:07:49,764 --> 00:07:52,444
Oh. She's someone...

88
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,054
I used to know.

89
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,574
Say hello. She's my wife.

90
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,344
Hello and welcome.

91
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:03,274
I didn't know I'd see you here.

92
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,784
Oh, right.

93
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,944
I heard the news about your mother.

94
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:14,284
I guess your co-workers don't know.

95
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,204
I'll show you to your seats.

96
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,124
Song Hak Fashion's Director 
Jeong Tae Min and his wife.

97
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:30,764
They're going in.

98
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,814
Hello, sir.

99
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:26,274
It's not easy gathering 
all of you at once.

100
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:29,804
Just by that, the TifÃ³ne exhibit 
accomplished its purpose.

101
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:38,174
The reason I invited the major 
shareholders is for next week's meeting.

102
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:44,444
To ask for your support in
 Chairman Ha Dae Woo's dismissal.

103
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,824
40% of the board is the 
Chairman's founding members.

104
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:53,154
The internal backlash 
will be tremendous.

105
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:09,334
Wait. Weren't those two
 on Chairman Ha's side?

106
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:13,534
Thankfully, Senior Managing 
Director Song and

107
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,924
Managing Director Park
 decided to join me.

108
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,774
If these two support me,

109
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,534
it'll be hard for the 
opposing side to interfere.

110
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,694
As long as the current 
chairman stays put,

111
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:28,974
we'll be limited on making changes.

112
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:30,934
It's a new era now.

113
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:34,704
If we keep to the old ways, 
we won't be competitive.

114
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,214
Our department store 
needs young blood now.

115
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:41,834
And you're the young 
blood, Vice President.

116
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:46,074
As you all know, Sung Un 
that has been an old faithful

117
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:50,164
climbed up to second in ranking 
three years after I became the VP.

118
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:52,824
If I take control, we'll be
 number one in the industry.

119
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:55,984
It won't be too far off.

120
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:03,904
It takes courage to 
bring about changes.

121
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,424
As we are all businessmen,

122
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:09,624
let's just think about the numbers.

123
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:12,514
I want to place my bet on this.

124
00:11:23,664 --> 00:11:25,474
Thank you, Father-in-law.

125
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,874
Born as a man,

126
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:32,054
you should harbor 
such ambitions. Right?

127
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,884
Don't worry about the shareholders.

128
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,504
They all...

129
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:41,084
know that turning their backs 
on you means betraying me.

130
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,554
They won't be able to say 
no to Dae Han Group.

131
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:46,534
Oh, right.

132
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:50,434
Let's all play golf with 
Myung Eun soon.

133
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:51,654
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:11:51,654 --> 00:11:52,534
All right.

135
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:03,244
Make sure my wife doesn't
 see that girl today.

136
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,294
This isn't the time to 
cross Myung Eun.

137
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:11,654
Yes, sir.

138
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,564
We'll have a wind of 
change pretty soon.

139
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:29,144
- Fill empty wine glasses right away.
- Yes, ma'am.

140
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:31,764
Are you okay?

141
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:34,614
Yes.

142
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,464
The servers for table
 three and four...

143
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:41,014
Their paths keep overlapping. 
Give them caution.

144
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:42,084
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:34,434
 

146
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,204
The auction company is here.

147
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:13,714
Should we set up the stage?

148
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,944
Since On Yoo Ri is still new,

149
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,944
don't let her interact 
directly with the VIPs.

150
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,804
Even a small mistake 
could be costly.

151
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:25,694
Yes, sir. I understand.

152
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:39,034
The auction will start in an hour.

153
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,224
- There won't be any issues, correct?
- No, ma'am.

154
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,134
Both you and Mi Na will be late
 tonight. What about the kids?

155
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:49,164
I got down on my knees and begged
 Aunt saying I'll pay her well.

156
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,034
Young Joon and Seo Joon
 must be big now.

157
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,174
Aigoo...

158
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,324
They should grow up asap
 and leave the house.

159
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:58,524
Or maybe I should be
 independent. I'm kidding.

160
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,244
- Any plans for Seo Joon's younger sibling?
- Not at all.

161
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:04,544
Aigoo, that would be 
crazy. A third one...

162
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:07,274
Aigoo, no. No plans.

163
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:13,754
By chance, did Mi Na say 
she wants a third child?

164
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,264
No, no.

165
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,374
Right? There's no way.

166
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,904
Assistant Manager Lee, 
please check over there.

167
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,604
- Okay.
- Go on.

168
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,454
Ms. Na, wait.

169
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:34,124
Please take good care 
of my Mi Na.

170
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,574
She seems a bit 
exhausted these days.

171
00:15:37,564 --> 00:15:38,634
Sure.

172
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:54,934
I'll prepare that for you.

173
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,454
Do you need anything?

174
00:16:06,454 --> 00:16:09,764
I want to say hello to 
Yonhan's President Park.

175
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,724
Could you switch our table?

176
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,114
My apologies.

177
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:14,884
It'll be difficult to 
switch around tables.

178
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,384
Don't be like that.

179
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,204
It's me, you know.

180
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:20,914
We go way back.

181
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,054
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:32,934
About your mother...

183
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:39,674
Where is she these days?

184
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:44,834
Aigoo. Was my voice too loud?

185
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:51,734
We're not just acquaintances here.

186
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,474
I'm concerned.

187
00:16:56,614 --> 00:17:01,814
I'll check to see if a seat is 
available near the dessert table.

188
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,164
Thanks.

189
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,664
Hey, we have a problem.

190
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,784
Hanjung Group's Chairwoman Lee

191
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:22,754
wants to participate 
anonymously in the auction?

192
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:23,714
Yes.

193
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,714
Since she'll be bringing 
a personal friend,

194
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:28,494
she doesn't want public 
exposure of any kind.

195
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:31,494
However, she wants to 
participate in the auction.

196
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:33,924
But an anonymous participation

197
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:36,024
will cause a stir for 
special treatment.

198
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,934
She's our number one 
Black Diamond Member.

199
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,804
It'll be difficult to turn her down.

200
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:42,444
And that's not the only issue...

201
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,414
You know.

202
00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:47,054
It won't be a shocker if Hanjung 
buys our department store tomorrow.

203
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,334
They're the top-ranking 
conglomerate group.

204
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,414
Why don't we have 
a proxy for the auction?

205
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,864
Let's do that.

206
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:02,174
Set up a private room 
to view the auction.

207
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,444
Yes, sir.

208
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,024
She's coming with her lover.

209
00:18:12,444 --> 00:18:15,304
And he's a celeb, to boot.

210
00:18:16,824 --> 00:18:18,114
Who is it?

211
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,024
You should be holed 
up like that forever.

212
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:51,544
Even that place is 
too good for you.

213
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:17,334
I didn't think Chairwoman Lee 
would show up.

214
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,854
Hanjung owns a 5% share
 of our department store.

215
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:25,504
Set up a meeting after the auction.

216
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:26,834
Yes, sir.

217
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,994
Did you have a pleasant ride here?

218
00:19:53,994 --> 00:19:55,224
Yes.

219
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:56,604
The room...

220
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:58,114
I'll show you in.

221
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,264
This place is nice.

222
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:06,644
Daebak. Her lover is Jung Goo Min.

223
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,634
Did he stop working on 
dramas these days?

224
00:20:08,634 --> 00:20:10,714
He could survive 
without doing this, no?

225
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,864
The auction will start
 in 30 minutes.

226
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,724
When you bid by 
watching the screen,

227
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,834
your proxy will relay it.

228
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:37,894
There's a bedroom, right?

229
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,744
That's more important to me.

230
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:42,874
Yes.

231
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,574
There is a bedroom inside.

232
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:58,414
Ms. Na, stay in the room for now.

233
00:20:58,414 --> 00:20:59,984
Attend to Chairwoman Lee.

234
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:02,744
- Report any issues right away.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:07,564
Ms. Lee and Ms. Kang, please
 tend to the event outside.

236
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:08,784
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,034
"There's a bedroom, right? 
That's more important to me."

238
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,294
Wow, I almost applauded.

239
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:18,434
It's the first time I've seen 
Chairwoman Lee smile.

240
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,424
That punk sure is something else.

241
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:22,694
And I can't say anything to anyone...

242
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,064
Be careful.

243
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:26,834
If you run your mouth, 
you might croak.

244
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,574
Geez Louise...

245
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:31,374
This is the case of 
"The Emperor's New Clothes."

246
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:43,994
Excuse me for a sec.

247
00:21:54,554 --> 00:21:55,794
Yeah.

248
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:57,584
I'm at an event.

249
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,714
Of course, most people 
aren't allowed here.

250
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,154
I'll bring you a limited edition.

251
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:05,984
Okay.

252
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:07,454
Yeah, later.

253
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,884
Why are they harassing you? Huh?

254
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,434
You don't even have time to eat.

255
00:22:15,264 --> 00:22:16,604
Eat up.

256
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:33,984
Excuse me for a moment.

257
00:22:36,294 --> 00:22:39,194
Hanjung Group's Senior Managing 
Director Park In Hwan...

258
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:41,734
Isn't he Chairwoman Lee's husband?

259
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:47,064
Does Chairwoman Lee 
know he's coming?

260
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:48,944
We should check.

261
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:50,244
What should we do?

262
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,494
He was invited. We can't 
stop him from attending.

263
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:56,434
For now, set his table 
and show him in.

264
00:22:56,494 --> 00:22:58,304
I'll relay this to Ms. Na.

265
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,654
Yes, sir.

266
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:03,614
The more I think about it,

267
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,634
we're in the three-year-tribulation.

268
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,934
He's here already.

269
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:10,994
Hello, sir.

270
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,634
I'm a bit late, huh?

271
00:23:13,634 --> 00:23:15,534
The auction hasn't 
started yet, right?

272
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:16,664
It hasn't started yet.

273
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:19,324
If you go inside, we'll 
show you to your seats.

274
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:25,614
Hanjung Group's Senior Managing
 Director Park In Hwan is coming in.

275
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:27,004
Please show him in.

276
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,744
Director Park's family 
runs a mid-sized business.

277
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,524
Hanjung's senior chairman 
was strongly opposed,

278
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:34,574
but they got married 
against all the odds.

279
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:36,534
Now they're cheating on each other.

280
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:38,044
But they're getting a divorce.

281
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:39,404
It's in progress.

282
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,194
A war to end all wars.

283
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:43,774
When ordinary couples end things,
 they show each other their worst.

284
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:45,694
Imagine a corporation like Hanjung.

285
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,504
Wow, I've never seen 
anything like this.

286
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:53,874
It looks fun.

287
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:57,204
Yes, I understand.

288
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:05,374
Chairwoman, I have 
something to tell you.

289
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,234
Senior Managing 
Director Park is here.

290
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:29,264
Please take care of this.

291
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:34,564
Honey.

292
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:37,424
- Are you not feeling well?
- No.

293
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,444
I don't think you are.

294
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:42,474
I have to go.

295
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:49,724
A sincere thanks to all the

296
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,774
VIPs joining us for today's auction.

297
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:56,204
All right, then. We'll start 
with our first auction.

298
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,784
 84 million, 86 million, 

299
00:25:01,784 --> 00:25:03,454
 88 million, 90 million won bid. 

300
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:04,604
Shall we increase by 3 million won?

301
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,864
Yes, I see 95 million won.

302
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:07,154
And 98 million won.

303
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,044
We're at 100 million won.

304
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:09,564
We'll increase by 
5 million won increments.

305
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,124
Do we have 105 million won?

306
00:25:11,124 --> 00:25:13,734
105 million, 110 million won, 
115 million won.

307
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:16,024
 120 million won. 125 million won. 

308
00:25:16,024 --> 00:25:17,804
 We have a 130 million won bid. 

309
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:19,434
 Yes, 150 million won, 

310
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,564
 150 million won. 150 million won. 

311
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:25,624
 Client No. 77 bid this item 
successfully at 150 million won. 

312
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:36,144
Where on earth did 
everyone disappear to?

313
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:38,144
Are you that bored?

314
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:40,434
Following me around like that.

315
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:42,064
But it's my job.

316
00:25:51,894 --> 00:25:54,524
Thanks to you, I had a nice
 talk with President Park.

317
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:55,664
But...

318
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:59,004
my wife wants to sit 
closer to the stage.

319
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:01,404
You can move us closer
 to the stage, right?

320
00:26:01,404 --> 00:26:02,944
My apologies.

321
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,584
As I told you earlier,

322
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:07,224
- it's difficult to switch tables.
- Don't be like that.

323
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:08,854
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:13,674
Man, you're hurting my feelings.

325
00:26:15,764 --> 00:26:17,994
You know how well I think of you.

326
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,714
You shouldn't do this.

327
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,144
Huh?

328
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:25,804
You can switch us, right?

329
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,154
Just...

330
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,774
say it.

331
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:36,174
So...

332
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:38,814
my family went bankrupt.

333
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:42,154
My mom is on the run 
from the creditors.

334
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:43,454
I'm not doing well, either.

335
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:45,684
Happy?

336
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:49,894
You had asked me why
 I hate you, right?

337
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:51,814
This is why.

338
00:26:51,814 --> 00:26:54,914
You're a lowlife and a loser,
 down to your bones.

339
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:55,914
What?

340
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,314
You're misunderstanding something.

341
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:07,344
Your family crawled your way 
up from the market place.

342
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,344
You don't belong in our world.

343
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,604
This is why one shouldn't 
date the lower class.

344
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:15,464
You don't know your place.

345
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:16,534
- Hey...
- Really?

346
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,634
So does your wife know?

347
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:23,664
That after we broke up, you were 
stalking me and got slapped...

348
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:25,394
with a restraining order.

349
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:33,404
Look, Tae Min.

350
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:36,564
If you're within 100 meters
 of my vicinity,

351
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:40,474
you'll be sleeping at the police
 station holding cell tonight.

352
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:48,254
Fine.

353
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:51,284
The only thing you have 
left is your pride.

354
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:54,634
Troll around the bottom some more,

355
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,334
and call me when
 you're ready to kneel.

356
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,424
It's not like we're strangers.

357
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:03,194
I'll consider it as helping the 
needy and help you out.

358
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:11,084
When that happens, 
I can call your wife, right?

359
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:15,444
She seems nice.

360
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,444
Honey.

361
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:19,784
Yes.

362
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:33,924
I'll check the backstage area.

363
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:21,534
You can cry.

364
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,224
We're all in the same shoes, so...

365
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:31,014
it's really okay.

366
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:05,477
Finally, we have today's highlight.

367
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,677
This necklace boasts
 a red diamond,

368
00:30:07,677 --> 00:30:10,067
the most expensive
 jewel in the world.

369
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:14,137
It's arranged in a new style 
setting only available by TifÃ³ne.

370
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:16,987
 There are only three available
 in the entire world. 

371
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,857
 We'll start the bid at 1.2 billion won. 

372
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:21,837
The increments are set 
at 10 million won.

373
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,737
1.2 billion, 1.3 billion won.

374
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:25,507
1.4 billion, 1.5 billion won.

375
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:26,457
 1.6 billion won. 

376
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,307
  We'll increase the increments
 to 50 million won. 

377
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,297
 1.8 billion, 1.85 billion won. 

378
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:31,587
We have a 1.9 billion won bid.

379
00:30:31,587 --> 00:30:33,137
1.95 billion won.

380
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,847
Any bids for 2 billion won?

381
00:30:40,907 --> 00:30:42,527
 We have a 2.1 billion won bid. 

382
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:43,627
 2.15 billion won. 

383
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:45,357
 2.2 billion won, 2.25 billion won. 

384
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:46,797
2.3 billion won,

385
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,077
2.35 billion won,

386
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:49,437
we have a 2.4 billion won bid.

387
00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,467
We'll set the increments 
at 100 million won now.

388
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,667
 2.5 billion won, 2.6 billion won. 

389
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,067
Any bids for 2.7 billion won?

390
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,187
Are you giving up?

391
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:18,537
All right.

392
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,817
2.6 billion won, 2.6 billion won.

393
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:22,277
2.6 billion won.

394
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:26,507
Sold to client No. 39 
at 2.6 billion won.

395
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:28,347
Congratulations.

396
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:46,107
Wow. Noona, you're on
 a different level.

397
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,737
A 2.6 billion won necklace...

398
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,097
Here are the desserts.

399
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,707
Which company are you from?

400
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:16,847
Catering team 1.

401
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,987
I believe Team 1's 
Kim Dong Hee is a female.

402
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,027
Pardon me while I check your ID.

403
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,327
Please wait here until 
the security arrives.

404
00:32:27,327 --> 00:32:29,697
Our apologies for 
causing a raucous.

405
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,397
We need to check on something...

406
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:53,527
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

407
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:54,387
Are you okay?

408
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:29,267
Stop!

409
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,427
That's enough.

410
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:31,797
Please stop.

411
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:13,797
Tell Director Park

412
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:15,547
that I want to see him.

413
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:21,297
I owe you one.

414
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:31,337
I'm not surprised No. 39 
was you, Honey.

415
00:34:31,337 --> 00:34:35,007
Anyhow, it was not meant for you.

416
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:38,517
Your needless greed 
only raised the bid.

417
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:42,317
Thanks to that, you ended
 up paying a higher price.

418
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,517
What a shame.

419
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:55,137
This would've been a good card

420
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:57,087
for our divorce proceedings.

421
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:58,957
You would never allow these

422
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,897
photos to be leaked to the media.

423
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:04,137
I'm sure you feel the same way.

424
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:07,527
How dare you bring 
such a thing here?

425
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,627
Because I know

426
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:12,697
you'll never permit this 
going outside, either.

427
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:14,347
You'll stop it, Honey.

428
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,327
I know how conscious 
you are of other people.

429
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,197
If you give in,

430
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:24,257
I'll stop putting you in a bind.

431
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:27,997
Still shallow as ever.

432
00:35:29,937 --> 00:35:34,117
Do you think such trivial threats
 will work against Hanjung?

433
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:36,777
I guess that's all you're capable of.

434
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,287
What?

435
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,527
You're here because 
you're Hanjung Group

436
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:44,147
Chairwoman Lee Sun Young's husband.

437
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,707
You've been booted from Hanjung.

438
00:35:46,707 --> 00:35:50,237
Do you think you could even 
sit face-to-face with me?

439
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,457
Stop the needless greed.

440
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:58,017
You can't have it anyway.

441
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:02,487
No matter how much it costs
 me, I have no intention

442
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:05,187
of letting you have anything.

443
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:13,467
Man, s***...

444
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,767
How much longer do 
we need to wait?

445
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,877
Excuse me.

446
00:36:20,877 --> 00:36:23,457
On top of Noona's purchases today,

447
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:25,497
could you add a men's watch?

448
00:36:25,497 --> 00:36:27,787
Frankly, adding a few million wons...

449
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:29,637
It won't even make a difference.

450
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,257
Our apologies.

451
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,617
Aside from the products
 the VIP ordered,

452
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:35,987
it'll be impossible to add-on.

453
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:39,337
I'm a VIP, too.

454
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:43,217
My apologies.

455
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:45,747
I see.

456
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,697
I guess I'm not?

457
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:56,327
If you place a proper order, 
we'll get it ready right away.

458
00:36:58,307 --> 00:36:59,867
You got me.

459
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:04,007
"That piece-of-trash. 
What's his deal?"

460
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:05,767
That's what you're thinking, right?

461
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:11,267
Sir, you're misunderstanding...

462
00:37:11,267 --> 00:37:13,667
I can see through your smile. 
Looking down on me.

463
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,947
Sir, there's a misunderstanding...

464
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,847
You need to make more
 effort, Noona.

465
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,237
You can't be so obvious.

466
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,877
Regardless of who I am...

467
00:37:24,877 --> 00:37:27,227
you should serve me.

468
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:44,407
Wow, I guess he got a scolding.

469
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,847
Noona, lose that loser husband.

470
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:49,367
Just live with me, huh?

471
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,087
Quit playing around while
 I still think you're cute.

472
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:55,087
I lived with him for 
20 years by choice.

473
00:37:55,087 --> 00:37:58,367
I thought you had some sense, 
even though you're dumb.

474
00:38:05,957 --> 00:38:09,437
Chairwoman, we need to
 tell you something.

475
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,917
For catering, please inquire with
 Assistant Manager Kim Ji Sun.

476
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:22,967
Hi.

477
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,977
You finally look the part 
of the Management Team.

478
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:55,157
This must hurt a lot.

479
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:57,647
You're not screaming at all.

480
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:00,327
Holding it in too much is an illness.

481
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:04,547
I think your bones are okay,

482
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:07,077
but your muscles will 
ache for a while.

483
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:09,217
I'll put a patch on.

484
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:11,187
I'll put it on after the event.

485
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:13,177
It's not a good idea 
because of the smell.

486
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:14,577
All right, then.

487
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:21,387
Are you okay?

488
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:27,997
If it hurts, just say it.

489
00:39:27,997 --> 00:39:31,057
I'd know only if you tell me.

490
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:33,157
Only if you tell me...

491
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,707
I will.

492
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:42,637
I'll tell you.

493
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,107
Let's talk it out...

494
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:48,167
after work tonight.

495
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:15,887
Thank you for seeing me, 
Chairwoman Lee.

496
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:18,147
I have to get going soon.

497
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:20,107
Please get right to the point.

498
00:40:21,957 --> 00:40:24,567
Since you're busy, I won't 
beat around the bush.

499
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:27,877
Sung Un Department Store 
shares which you hold.

500
00:40:27,877 --> 00:40:30,527
Could you please stand on my side?

501
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,607
I like you, Vice President Ha.

502
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:38,737
You have ambition,

503
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:42,177
and you have the 
capabilities to carry it out.

504
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:44,167
However...

505
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:47,377
I have enough on my plate 
with family matters.

506
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,987
It's not like I don't 
know Chairman Ha.

507
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:53,217
I don't feel right intruding 
on a family feud.

508
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,457
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:59,367
Would you possibly reconsider?

510
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:03,537
Instead, my shares will 
stay on neutral ground.

511
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,247
I have no other choice.

512
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:10,657
Once you're set on something, 
you don't change easily.

513
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:13,007
Thank you for your understanding.

514
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:16,177
If you change your mind, 
give me a call at any time.

515
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:19,717
It won't hurt to have me on
 your side, Chairwoman.

516
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:21,467
I will.

517
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:25,247
I have matters to tend to. 
I'll get going first.

518
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:26,667
Well, then.

519
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:35,067
That arrogant...

520
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:51,587
May I help you?

521
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:55,377
I got lost after going
 to the restroom.

522
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,487
I'll show you to your seat.

523
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:59,107
Thank you.

524
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:30,497
Since you weren't back, 
I sent Secretary Ha for you.

525
00:42:30,497 --> 00:42:33,137
This young lady here helped me.

526
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:34,517
Isn't that her?

527
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:37,407
You know. Sung Un VP's
 you-know-what.

528
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:38,657
Over here.

529
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,767
Bring me more wine.

530
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,947
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:47,837
I was talking to you, Miss.

532
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:51,977
Yes, ma'am.

533
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:31,907
What wine is this?

534
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:37,957
It's an 1864 Chateau Margeaux.

535
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:42,467
It's full-bodied with strong tannin,

536
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:45,967
but it's superbly fermented 
with deep scent and flavor.

537
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:47,347
Yes.

538
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:50,877
Being aged and having 
depth is good, but...

539
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:54,277
I like light head wines 
these days, too.

540
00:43:55,447 --> 00:43:57,907
It's new and fresh.

541
00:43:57,907 --> 00:43:59,807
It feels lively.

542
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,037
Is that why men seek 
out such women?

543
00:44:10,687 --> 00:44:12,317
Do you have anything like that?

544
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:17,707
Please give me a moment.

545
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:25,007
I'll do it.

546
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:26,927
Help with cleaning the 
backstage, Yoo Ri.

547
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:36,187
But she asked me.

548
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,707
Chairwoman Lee will be
 leaving in 10 minutes.

549
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:14,117
I'm curious as well.

550
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:16,277
May I have a taste?

551
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:17,737
Sure.

552
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,007
It's rotten.

553
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,657
Even if it's new,

554
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:03,797
if it's rotten, it's trash.

555
00:46:03,797 --> 00:46:05,177
Isn't that right?

556
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:09,767
Oh...

557
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,147
The rotten smell is 
coming from here,

558
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:14,207
not the wine.

559
00:46:20,397 --> 00:46:23,077
You're not even worth 
the price of a wine.

560
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,007
Let's go see Chairwoman Lee.

561
00:46:57,497 --> 00:46:58,487
Yes, sir.

562
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:51,197
My apologies.

563
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:52,957
I should've been more attentive.

564
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:55,407
It can't happen again.

565
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:58,507
Even one mistake is too many.

566
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:12,607
Hey. Mr. Weakling.

567
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:16,547
Take care of this first.

568
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:24,197
I told you not to act like
 you know me.

569
00:48:24,197 --> 00:48:26,437
Are you Luke Skywalker
 or something?

570
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,567
You can't address 
your own father?

571
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:31,147
What if my co-workers see us?

572
00:48:31,147 --> 00:48:33,087
Geez, no. It'll be a headache.

573
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:34,747
Team Leader Park probably knows.

574
00:48:37,737 --> 00:48:38,697
How?

575
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:41,227
Team Leaders can see your profile
 and know who your dad is.

576
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:43,077
What do you mean, how?

577
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:49,287
Anyway, please go. 
Before everyone sees us.

578
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:51,247
Let's go.

579
00:48:52,677 --> 00:48:54,857
Who does he think he is? 
Overreacting like that.

580
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:12,367
What are you doing?

581
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,717
I'm checking the bidding records.

582
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:26,147
Oh, no...

583
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:38,957
Assistant Manager Lee.

584
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:41,317
Take a look at this real quick.

585
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:45,917
This one, right here.

586
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:54,777
Fortunately, it wasn't much 
blood, and it stopped.

587
00:50:54,777 --> 00:50:58,327
It's still the early stages. 
You must get some rest.

588
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,197
Okay, thank you.

589
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:02,037
Also...

590
00:51:02,037 --> 00:51:06,197
I didn't notify my team 
of my pregnancy yet.

591
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,297
Please keep it confidential.

592
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:10,547
All right. Get some rest.

593
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:32,617
Excuse me.

594
00:51:32,617 --> 00:51:35,617
I was told the Team Leader is here. 
Did he go somewhere?

595
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:37,837
The stage team called 
for him. So he's there.

596
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:39,297
It'll take a while.

597
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:41,257
Thank you.

598
00:51:53,147 --> 00:51:55,057
 Team Leader Park probably knows. 

599
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,217
 

600
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,687
 

601
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:23,737
Aigoo, Team Leader is
 a man after all.

602
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:26,267
 I'll tell you. 

603
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:29,327
 Let's talk it out... 

604
00:53:29,327 --> 00:53:31,287
 after work tonight. 

605
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:27,617
 I'll wait for you at 
Kraukus coffee shop. 

606
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:42,967
 

607
00:57:36,437 --> 00:57:37,767
Who is it?

608
00:58:08,187 --> 00:58:09,877
I'm sorry.

609
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:12,697
I...

610
00:58:13,797 --> 00:58:16,527
I know I shouldn't contact you, but...

611
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:21,867
But today...

612
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,367
Today was really...

613
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:10,677
 

614
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:13,737
â«  Don't bring me down  â«

615
00:59:13,737 --> 00:59:19,387
â«  Don't bring me down  â«

616
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:24,777
â«  Oh baby, don't want to know 
if the mystery exists  â«

617
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:29,557
â«  Cuz I won't see him no more
I don't care   â«

618
00:59:29,557 --> 00:59:31,777
â«  Don't bother me now  â«

619
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:38,087
â«  I don't know why
I don't know why  â«

620
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:38,987
 Ms. Yoo Ri! 

621
00:59:38,987 --> 00:59:39,977
 Is it someone I know? 

622
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:42,917
 Now I know you can't glue 
back shattered glass. 

623
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:44,567
 Did you see the article? 
By chance, that video clip... 

624
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:45,667
 I thought you'd be cautious. 

625
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,067
 You're more careless
 than I thought. 

626
00:59:47,147 --> 00:59:47,987
 Mi Na! 

627
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:50,507
 I think my mom is being 
punished in my place. 

628
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,917
 Take a good look. 
See what you've ruined. 

629
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:54,577
 Are you seeing that woman again? 

630
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:56,377
 Jung Sun, let's stop. 

631
00:59:56,377 --> 01:00:01,547
â«  Don't bring me down...  â«
