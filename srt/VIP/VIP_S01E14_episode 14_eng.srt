1
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:43,222
If you really want to be on my side,

2
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:45,092
prove yourself through
 the Task Force.

3
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,422
I'm a businesswoman.

4
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,762
Take and give.

5
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:56,092
If you prove yourself, I'll be the one

6
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:58,692
to support you.

7
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,142
Yes.

8
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:02,982
I understand.

9
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,502
Creating a task force with the 
VIP Management Team means

10
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:15,272
she'll be stopping me publicly.

11
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,902
It seems like Ms. Na is
 on the President's side.

12
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:22,992
I don't like what she's doing lately.

13
00:01:24,092 --> 00:01:27,652
If Ms. Na continues this, 
we can't tolerate it.

14
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,312
I'll try talking to her.

15
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:33,252
My sister's declaring war.

16
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:35,642
I can't let her take control.

17
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:41,222
Starting today,

18
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,362
we'll be operating under 
the Task Force System.

19
00:01:43,362 --> 00:01:45,602
Let's do our bests.

20
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:57,422
 

21
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:01,462
So we'll be creating 
a league just for them.

22
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:04,072
Social status and reputation...

23
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:07,202
There might be a strong backlash
 without objective standards.

24
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:08,812
There are a lot of objective
 standards we could use.

25
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,532
Level of education, 
background, and assets.

26
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,482
Why not figure who's 
born legitimately or not?

27
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,582
Just like during Silla era...

28
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:18,102
Let's come up with the 
first round of criteria

29
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:20,182
and select among the 
Black Diamond members.

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,972
You have to strike them hard first.

31
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,272
You have to make 
an impact at the get-go

32
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,042
to leave an impression.

33
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,832
It has to be memorable for everyone

34
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:34,892
so others will desperately
 try to be one of the 99.

35
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:39,122
Please think about it on your
 own and share your ideas.

36
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:42,572
The Prestige Team will narrow 
down the list for the first round.

37
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,422
No.

38
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:47,682
I think it'd be more 
efficient if we did it.

39
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:50,112
The VIP Management Team
 has more information

40
00:02:50,112 --> 00:02:51,972
on the Black Diamond members.

41
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,362
We've been managing 
them until recently.

42
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:57,352
We'll have to research 
everyone individually.

43
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,732
We'll be faster at it, too.

44
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:04,112
The two teams will 
proceed together then.

45
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:07,842
That's a better way to collect
 various opinions and ideas

46
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,722
many people agree on.

47
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,102
Okay then.

48
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:15,802
That'd be all for today's meeting.

49
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:17,192
Yes.

50
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:19,862
Ms. Na, let's talk for a second.

51
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:21,292
Yes.

52
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,412
Why is the mood of 
this team so cold?

53
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,762
I know, right?

54
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,542
It's like a battlefield.

55
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,222
See you.

56
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,702
Will you tell them today?

57
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,742
Thanks for the hard work.

58
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:52,682
Likewise.

59
00:03:58,522 --> 00:03:59,932
I'll be seeing you often.

60
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:03,592
I know.

61
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:23,422
I know this is uncomfortable.

62
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,752
When the Task Force System ends,

63
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:27,472
I'll make sure the
 VIP Management Team

64
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,532
won't experience any disadvantages.

65
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:34,182
And I'll make sure you don't suffer
 at work because of me.

66
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,612
So please stop now.

67
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:38,642
Stop what?

68
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:40,922
Getting involved in the 
higher-ups' drama.

69
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:44,982
You wouldn't have if
 it weren't for me.

70
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:51,342
The VP will try to fight 
with full force.

71
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,102
Then you'd get hurt, too.

72
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,532
Don't pretend you care.

73
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,832
I'll manage my own business.

74
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:05,142
We'll have to see who gets hurt.

75
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,172
VP won't be the only one
 to fight full force.

76
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:14,122
I might end up attacking you.

77
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,312
I think you're mistaken.

78
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:20,032
You're doing that already.

79
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,062
And I'll surely fight back.

80
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:29,762
Okay.

81
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:33,222
But why are you...

82
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:36,272
insisting on being on the VP's side?

83
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,682
What's going on between you two?

84
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:14,592
Ms. Na, I have something to tell you.

85
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:23,112
It hasn't been that long since you
 became the team leader.

86
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,962
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,412
Have you decided to quit?

88
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:32,632
I'll stay until the end of
 the Task Force project.

89
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,882
You must've contemplated 
a long time for this decision.

90
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,182
But please reconsider once more.

91
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:45,102
I'll put the resignation 
process on hold for now.

92
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,842
I hope you change your mind.

93
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:54,672
For both our team and me,

94
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:57,572
you're an irreplaceable person.

95
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,352
Aigoo.

96
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,982
This lady shops with
 her lover so much that

97
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:12,292
even her lover became a VIP now.

98
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,992
They'll get busted any day since
 they're so blatant about it.

99
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,122
He's the president 
of Songdam Group.

100
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,262
Of course, he should be included.

101
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:26,092
He was on probation 
for assault five years ago.

102
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,812
I think we should leave him out.

103
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,722
But he's No. 3 in the 
Black Diamond list.

104
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:33,702
The Black Society is 
a social group all about

105
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,162
social status and reputation.

106
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,752
President Lee Sang Won even

107
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,342
received a prison sentence

108
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,202
due to a case related to a gang.

109
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:41,532
We'll leave him out.

110
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:45,062
Let's do that.

111
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,362
I heard he'll be appointed the 
president of Hangook University.

112
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,672
His wife has been bragging all over.

113
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,082
There's barely any
 information on Lee Soo Jung.

114
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:08,702
Lee Soo Jung?

115
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,962
I've never seen her before.

116
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,302
Have you?

117
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:13,202
No.

118
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,292
Aigoo, someone that the VIP 
Management Team doesn't know.

119
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,102
Which store does she frequent?

120
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,272
The Samsung store.

121
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,522
No way I wouldn't know 
someone from a prominent family.

122
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:24,422
What's going on?

123
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:25,852
One of us should know her

124
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,032
if she's a Black Diamond member.

125
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:31,162
This member doesn't 
qualify. Let's move on.

126
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,142
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

127
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:34,362
Next person.

128
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:35,302
 

129
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:38,262
We should clarify the
 reason for exclusion.

130
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,542
She lives mostly abroad.

131
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,342
If she spends this
 much living abroad,

132
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:47,042
she must spend a ton
 whenever she visits.

133
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:49,832
 

134
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,272
The VIP Management Team 
should've done this alone.

135
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:57,402
Why call us?

136
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,352
We showed them who's boss today.

137
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,092
This is Na Jung Sun.

138
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:10,902
Yes.

139
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,352
Got it.

140
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:18,452
I asked you to come

141
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,542
because of the Black Society
 launching event.

142
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,122
Launching event?

143
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:25,492
This is the concept I decided on.

144
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,812
A fundraiser for the 
members' unwed children?

145
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:34,992
The Black Society 
members will become

146
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,672
core figures in politics 
and financial circles.

147
00:09:37,672 --> 00:09:41,322
And marriage connections are 
one of their biggest interests.

148
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:43,442
So the purpose of this event is...

149
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,572
It's sort of a matchmaking market.

150
00:09:45,572 --> 00:09:46,992
This world is smaller than

151
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,982
you think, and rumors spread fast.

152
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:51,932
Opportunities to meet
 different candidates are limited.

153
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:54,222
But if they get a chance like this,

154
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,712
the prominent families in Korea

155
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,912
would kill to get their 
children involved.

156
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,402
Of course,

157
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,852
we must know exactly
 what they want

158
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,872
and find perfect matches 
for them, right?

159
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,392
You'll need this person for that.

160
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:10,982
Meet with her.

161
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:14,032
Yes.

162
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,732
 

163
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,692
Yes, we will.

164
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:24,652
Take Manager Ha Yoo Ri
 to the meeting.

165
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,562
She'd love to come with you.

166
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,312
Since Manager Ha is a 
new face who showed up

167
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:32,002
out of nowhere.

168
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,532
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,212
Hey.

170
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:49,232
Song Yi Young?

171
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,772
- Do you know her?
- Of course!

172
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,622
She's known as "Midas Song."

173
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:56,392
The most coveted matchmaker
 among the rich ladies.

174
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:58,442
I heard there isn't a single couple

175
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:01,602
who didn't go through her 
in the world of high society.

176
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:04,112
So host a party to get 
the young wealthy

177
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:05,572
elites to hooked up?

178
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,412
How provocative. Impactful.

179
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:10,382
Those rich bastards 
are about to join forces

180
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,542
and become even richer.

181
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,582
Geez, darn capitalism.

182
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,082
Mi Na resigned.

183
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,822
So...

184
00:11:24,822 --> 00:11:26,772
she decided to quit?

185
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,172
Yes.

186
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:29,532
Yes.

187
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:33,072
She's seen it all. It's about 
time she's sick of it all.

188
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:38,002
It's a relief if she's 
quitting voluntarily,

189
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:40,222
but if she's not...

190
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,142
Seriously.

191
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:44,632
Shouldn't the government 
support her?

192
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:47,882
Working while raising kids 
shouldn't be a mission impossible.

193
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:49,562
I know.

194
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:58,612
If a new level is created,

195
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,962
we'll need a separate 
system managing

196
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,432
those members electronically.

197
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:04,732
We also need a system
 to share the information

198
00:12:04,732 --> 00:12:06,842
with the collaborating companies.

199
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:09,872
Sharing members' information 
with other companies

200
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:12,222
may take time due to security issues.

201
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:15,142
Which team would be 
managing the electronic system?

202
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,572
Prestige team will.

203
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:22,262
Have you talked it 
over with Ms. Na?

204
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,572
That's what Mr. Park wants.

205
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:30,352
I'll report that to our team as well.

206
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:31,732
Yes.

207
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:35,532
Please share the 
timeline with us then.

208
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:36,792
Yes.

209
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,682
Thank you.

210
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,672
I didn't think she'd be like this.

211
00:12:48,672 --> 00:12:51,462
She's acting all high 
and mighty already...

212
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,522
She didn't even get the 
manager title on her own.

213
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:57,442
She's way below you in
 terms of competence.

214
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,762
It's okay.

215
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,402
You won't have to deal with 
this bulls*** much longer.

216
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,642
Let's go.

217
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,532
 

218
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,592
- This week's system...
- I'll do it.

219
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:40,962
- On the weekend?
- Yes.

220
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:43,112
Okay then. Mr. Lee will be on it.

221
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,662
And by chance...

222
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,752
let me do overtime
 if there's extra work.

223
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,212
Okay then.

224
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,762
What's this now?

225
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:54,072
Acting like a workaholic?

226
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,432
I'm the breadwinner now. 
I'll make an extra penny.

227
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:57,732
Aigoo...

228
00:13:57,742 --> 00:13:59,992
Give me any unwanted tasks.

229
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:01,202
But pay me.

230
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,882
- 20% off.
- Okay, 30%.

231
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:03,922
You owe me 50,000 won.

232
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:06,262
- Sorry, forget it.
- Every single penny counts.

233
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:11,612
I think everything's clean enough.

234
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:15,112
Please double-check the 
number of desserts and wine...

235
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,302
Hi.

236
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:19,172
Long time no see.

237
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,392
Madam!

238
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,942
How perfect.

239
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,112
You have time, right?

240
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:25,692
Yes.

241
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,562
It's the customers' 
assessment of Joyful Time.

242
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:39,382
The Conversation Room 
got a low rating.

243
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:42,172
Seriously, Ma Sang Woo...

244
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,062
The AI broke down,

245
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,572
so we used Sang Woo 
as AI that day.

246
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:49,892
I told him to do well,
 but he made every kid cry.

247
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:52,272
 I saw your future self, and 

248
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,132
 you looked happy. 

249
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:56,562
 You'll be happy for sure. 

250
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,032
What?

251
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,052
Is something wrong?

252
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:03,452
No.

253
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,912
 

254
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:24,982
 

255
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,102
 

256
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,132
 

257
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,032
So, dear...

258
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,532
how have you been?

259
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,732
Yes, pretty good.

260
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:04,372
In the meantime, it looks like
 you became a hotshot.

261
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,572
So hot!

262
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:11,432
Wow, you became 
a totally different person.

263
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,662
I read the article and...

264
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,332
realized that I've 
embarrassing myself

265
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,932
with a wealthy elite's daughter.

266
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,142
What's it like...

267
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:24,672
to have a wealthy dad 
all of a sudden?

268
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,202
Are you happy?

269
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,952
I don't know.

270
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:32,592
Yes, well...

271
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,652
You think money would
 fix everything,

272
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:36,952
but it doesn't.

273
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,482
But still...

274
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,782
it's better than not having any.

275
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,232
Don't you think?

276
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:49,932
There are lots of nice things here.

277
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:51,522
May I help you?

278
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,852
Why don't you choose for me?

279
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,872
- Me?
- Let's see...

280
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:58,352
how much you improved.

281
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,022
Show me what you got.

282
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,582
Yes.

283
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,062
How about something like this?

284
00:17:19,062 --> 00:17:20,432
You have good taste.

285
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,272
The glossy reinforced glass and

286
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:25,092
stainless steel frame suits
 other built-in appliances.

287
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,242
It's our most popular product lately.

288
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,352
We'll visit you on the 
day you mentioned

289
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,872
and consult you in person.

290
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,102
Thank you.

291
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,872
All right! Let's go.

292
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:54,922
Yes, ma'am.

293
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:03,742
The coffee here is still bitter.

294
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:08,282
Nothing beats instant coffee.

295
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:13,922
I wondered about you since
 I haven't seen you in a while.

296
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:16,972
Just because...

297
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:21,232
Shopping isn't as fun 
as it used to be.

298
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:24,872
I visited my daughter 
in Canada recently

299
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,322
and she said...

300
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,082
"You lived your whole life, 
trying to satisfy everyone.

301
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,612
But why do you still

302
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,782
worry about others 
when you have money?"

303
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:35,902
When I heard that I felt...

304
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:37,412
kind of...

305
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,642
s***ty.

306
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,242
Like you said last time,

307
00:18:44,242 --> 00:18:47,622
people judge based 
on what they see.

308
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,072
That's right.

309
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,712
But you do look the part.

310
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:55,722
For some reason,

311
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:58,222
you became more 
sophisticated somehow.

312
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,402
Not at all.

313
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:00,762
Is it because you're a
 wealthy elite's daughter?

314
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:02,942
You're definitely different.

315
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:05,712
You already...

316
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,592
became one of them.

317
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,352
 You already... 

318
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:35,142
 became one of them. 

319
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,102
 How about a drink tonight? 

320
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,272
- Dad.
- Yes?

321
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,172
- Are we moving?
- No.

322
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,412
Wait...

323
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:13,402
- Are we moving?
- I don't know.

324
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,732
I don't know.

325
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:19,692
Hold this.

326
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,612
Let go.

327
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,152
40 cm.

328
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,732
What are you doing?

329
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:31,172
I want to change the layout
 of Young Joon's room.

330
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:32,872
I hear changing the layout

331
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,422
for kids improves 
their thinking skills.

332
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:37,312
Do this now?

333
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:40,472
No, after I quit.

334
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:45,052
The desk... He'll start 
elementary school.

335
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,192
We should get him 
a bigger desk, too.

336
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:50,322
Do it later. You're still working.

337
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,722
Aren't you tired after 
working all day?

338
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,052
It's okay.

339
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,312
All right, let's take it slow.

340
00:20:58,312 --> 00:21:00,192
We still have a lot of time,
 Ms. Song Mi Na.

341
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,912
That's why.

342
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:04,182
I'm afraid I'd have too much time.

343
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:12,722
You're right, let's do it later.

344
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,002
No need to rush.

345
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:17,452
Young Joon! Seo Joon!

346
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:18,492
Hey!

347
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:20,922
Young Joon! Seo Joon! 
Young Joon!

348
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,492
You don't look so happy.

349
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,332
Am I just imagining it?

350
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:36,752
I just...

351
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,552
don't feel so good today.

352
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:40,572
Is it me?

353
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:43,562
No.

354
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,232
It's just...

355
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,942
about work.

356
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:56,372
Do you want to play?

357
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:00,732
Loser pays.

358
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:09,242
Yes!

359
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:10,332
1:0.

360
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,162
Here I go!

361
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:26,012
You have to aim this way. 
Not that way.

362
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,942
Ice water if you're hot?

363
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,492
How childish.

364
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:45,122
Geez...

365
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,672
Hold on a sec.

366
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:51,412
I don't think tying your 
hair up will do much.

367
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:52,842
Hold on a sec!

368
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:54,052
Okay.

369
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:11,142
Finally scored!

370
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,492
You finally scored.

371
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:33,862
So...

372
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,602
is this the last round?

373
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:37,732
Okay, the last one.

374
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,842
So...

375
00:24:01,842 --> 00:24:03,792
thanks for the drinks.

376
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:20,232
Are you that happy?

377
00:24:20,232 --> 00:24:21,662
I won.

378
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,132
It feels so great to win. 
It's been a while.

379
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,292
To be honest,

380
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,812
I've been feeling very small lately.

381
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,092
I used to think

382
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:37,172
that I'm the most 
successful person

383
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:40,102
in this whole world at one point.

384
00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:41,732
But...

385
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:45,732
I'm so pitiful these days.

386
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:51,072
Earlier today,

387
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:54,232
I saw Jung Sun in the 
team leader's office

388
00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:57,632
and I thought...

389
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:01,462
"I could've

390
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:04,032
been where she is

391
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:06,642
right now."

392
00:25:07,802 --> 00:25:10,462
Since when did I become this?

393
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:13,242
Will I keep getting smaller 
for the rest of my life?

394
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:17,182
That's why I felt sad.

395
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:24,572
Is this why people say
 looks are deceiving?

396
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:29,372
I never thought you became small.

397
00:25:32,642 --> 00:25:35,232
But I like that you 
just told me that.

398
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,112
Makes you feel human.

399
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:41,002
You know what?

400
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:43,232
I contemplated whether I should

401
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:45,292
text you or not
 a million times today.

402
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,432
I worried I'd get rejected again.

403
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,462
I act cool,

404
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:58,272
but it's all an act.

405
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:02,852
And...

406
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,712
you're finally feeling small now?

407
00:26:04,712 --> 00:26:06,412
You have a long way to go.

408
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,792
Everyone else became 
small way before.

409
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:13,822
Humans are meant to be pathetic.

410
00:26:16,832 --> 00:26:17,872
Here.

411
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,362
Jin Ho.

412
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:28,412
Do you want to date me?

413
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:32,842
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,052
It's okay.

415
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:40,232
You want to date me?

416
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,312
Yes.

417
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:43,752
With me?

418
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:47,322
Really?

419
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,392
Why?

420
00:27:03,002 --> 00:27:04,502
I'll think about it.

421
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:11,532
Think about it then.

422
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,302
Mom, I decided to quit my job.

423
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:26,182
 Aigoo, good thinking. 

424
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,062
 It's not like your husband 
doesn't make money. 

425
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,312
 I never knew why 
you were so antsy. 

426
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:32,312
 Just raise your children well. 

427
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:34,162
 Kids are important, not work. 

428
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:37,332
You're upsetting me
 if you say that, Mom.

429
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:41,142
I've been trying so hard to
 stay there. How about...

430
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:43,902
all the time I spent trying?

431
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:46,402
 No, that's not what I meant. 

432
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:49,722
 You've had it tough
 raising kids while working. 

433
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,032
 Mi Na, are you crying? 

434
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,492
No.

435
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:01,822
Byung Hoon is here. 
I'll call you later.

436
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,432
 

437
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:27,050
Chairman always favored

438
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,400
Jae Woong since he was a kid.

439
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,910
He always gave him 
whatever's best

440
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,830
and whatever's the most expensive.

441
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,300
Father gave me this 
position just to scare him

442
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,440
for the time being.

443
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,620
I know that, too.

444
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,320
But I'm not interested 
in being used

445
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,470
as a puppet like that at all.

446
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,750
That won't be fun at all.

447
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,490
I'll be attacking Jae Woong.

448
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,350
Too many people belong 
to Jae Woong right now.

449
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,290
In order to make people
 listen to me,

450
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,080
I should scrape what's there

451
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,070
and set things up again.

452
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,750
Don't you think that 
might be too risky?

453
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,660
I know Jae Woong well.

454
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,390
I should attack him 
before I get attacked.

455
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,210
So...

456
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,410
which path would you 
choose, Mr. Choi?

457
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,890
Are you feeling sick?

458
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,980
It's not a big deal.

459
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,180
I think I have heartburn from

460
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,050
stressing out lately.

461
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,450
It happens sometimes. It's fine.

462
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,190
It's because you have 
to keep seeing him.

463
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,020
You should take care 
of your health.

464
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,750
You don't seem so well lately.

465
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,440
Thank you.

466
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,310
We're here because we need your
 help for our upcoming event.

467
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,950
Ms. Ha Tae Young told me about it.

468
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,130
I heard over 85% of the 
couples you matched

469
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,440
end up getting married.

470
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,380
We'd do our best, so this 
collaboration would be

471
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,940
a great opportunity for both of us.

472
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,450
Actually, high society couples are

473
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,510
easier to match than 
ordinary couples.

474
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,480
You simply have to consider
 the material conditions.

475
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,600
Since feelings can be eliminated,

476
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,170
it's more likely that
 it'd be successful.

477
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,640
Information is everything to us.

478
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,570
We need an accurate database

479
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,060
to raise the success rate.

480
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,260
So I'm curious about

481
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,780
the two people who are present.

482
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,500
You're the son of the 
Foreign Minister Ma, right?

483
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,510
Well, the thing is...

484
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,030
And you're VP 
Ha Jae Woong's daughter.

485
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,670
If I'm allowed to
 interview these two,

486
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,430
I'll take on the project.

487
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,410
Go ahead.

488
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,340
All I need to do is 
answer a few questions.

489
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,000
I'll do it, too.

490
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,020
She wanted to know 
everything including

491
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,000
the number of spoons
 in our house.

492
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,600
Well done.

493
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,950
You don't have to do it...

494
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,840
if you don't want to.

495
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,000
I want to be helpful.

496
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,520
This is not an interrogation. 
Don't be so nervous.

497
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Okay.

498
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,700
Ms. Ha Yoo Ri.

499
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,300
You grew up in the care of 
On Hye Sun until you were 28.

500
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,650
When VP Ha Jae Woong of Sung Un

501
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,100
turned out to be your birth father,

502
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,290
you're living under his roof.

503
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,190
Your mother has been 
in the nursing home

504
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,590
and passed away recently.

505
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,190
Since VP and his wife
 have no children,

506
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Mr. Ha legally adopted you
 recently into Ha family registry.

507
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,830
This info pops up just by 
searching the internet.

508
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,920
I'll ask you what I want to know

509
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,940
starting now.

510
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,490
What are you looking for
 in your future spouse?

511
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,110
I'm not sure.

512
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,620
Just...

513
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,940
someone warm and kind.

514
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,140
That's what On Yoo Ri wants.

515
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,500
Don't you think what 
Ha Yoo Ri wants

516
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,900
should be a bit different?

517
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Let me ask you again.

518
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,930
The terms of condition
 that Ha Yoo Ri wants...

519
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,300
in a spouse.

520
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,900
What is that?

521
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,900
I'll do it.

522
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,720
I think it's best if Ms. Na 
doesn't see you right now.

523
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,440
Here's some painkiller. 
Take some for now.

524
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,290
Thank you.

525
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,410
If you send me the
 contract, I'll review it

526
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,170
and get in touch with you.

527
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,340
Thank you.

528
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,480
Well, then.

529
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,420
Just one second.

530
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,870
Do you happen to know 
Ms. Lee Soo Jung?

531
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,030
She's one of our VIP customers,

532
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,000
but our database had 
no information on her.

533
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,930
I thought you might know her.

534
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,910
She's the chairwoman 
of the LN Foundation.

535
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,230
You don't have to know 
more about her, though.

536
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,040
It'd be tough for her to join
 the Black Society anyway.

537
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,050
What do you mean by that?

538
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,460
She's the mistress of 
VP Ha Jae Woong of Sung Un.

539
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,510
Pardon?

540
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,350
Even his wife knows 
but plays ignorant.

541
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
A long-term relationship.

542
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,800
I see.

543
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,990
What are you thinking about?

544
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
It's nothing.

545
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,680
Doesn't Sang Woo...

546
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,030
take excellent care of Ms. Na?

547
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,090
Could he be interested in Ms. Na?

548
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,170
Not sure.

549
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,300
 

550
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,210
Where are we?

551
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,950
The hospital.

552
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,300
I'm fine. I feel better with medicine.

553
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,960
It'll get worse over time.

554
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,110
Thank you, Sang Woo...

555
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,890
for taking care of me so much.

556
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,000
 She's the mistress of 
VP Ha Jae Woong of Sung Un. 

557
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
 This member doesn't 
qualify. Let's move on. 

558
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,370
There's probably...

559
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,670
a lot she doesn't know yet.

560
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,510
You should help her
 a lot, Soo Yeon.

561
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,860
When I was in middle school,

562
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,410
you told me that...

563
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,230
tigers drop their cubs off the cliff

564
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,150
and keep the ones that survive.

565
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,700
Our family is like that, too.

566
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,590
Shouldn't we apply the 
same rule for her, too...

567
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,600
to be fair?

568
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,950
She's definitely your granddaughter.

569
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,030
Rules have to be fair.

570
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,600
If you belong to the Ha family,

571
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,300
you should know how to 
gather your own food.

572
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Don't worry, Father.

573
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,730
I'm sure she'd be good at it.

574
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,940
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

575
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,900
All of you, keep that in mind.

576
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,600
Yes, sir.

577
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,610
Father, have some more fish.

578
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,920
When are you going
 back to Boston?

579
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,670
Probably in two weeks or so.

580
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,990
Why don't you guys hang
 out before you leave?

581
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,300
When's a good time?

582
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,200
Are you too busy?

583
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,460
Excuse me...

584
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,120
would you like to visit Mom 
at the mausoleum sometime?

585
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,400
You didn't get to come
 to the funeral.

586
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,100
I think I should make this clear.

587
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,280
To me, your mom is

588
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,850
someone I knew briefly in my 20's.

589
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,080
No more or less than that.

590
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,350
Since you joined the family,

591
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,650
it'd be better for you if you

592
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,560
remove her trace as 
much as possible.

593
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,630
Mr. Lee will drive you home.

594
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
 

595
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,540
 Happy birthday. 

596
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,670
 Let's have a meal together today. 

597
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,880
You must be hungry.

598
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,580
I'm excited.

599
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,000
I don't know if it's any good.

600
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,230
Thank you so much.

601
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,510
It's good.

602
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,650
Eat a lot.

603
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,780
It's been ten years

604
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,580
someone made me seaweed soup

605
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,310
on my birthday.

606
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,220
Since Mom got hospitalized,

607
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,920
I had no energy to 
celebrate my birthday.

608
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,120
Thank you.

609
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,750
I prayed that...

610
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,500
we get to celebrate my 
next birthday together.

611
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,250
There's...

612
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,800
a place I want to go to.

613
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,640
Looks delicious.

614
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,890
Everyone, eat as much as you want.

615
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,400
If you sneak alcohol, you're 
walking home. Got that?

616
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,730
 - Yes, sir! 
- Let's eat!

617
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,500
How can you work hard
 if you eat like that?

618
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,100
Eat more, okay?

619
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,590
So you can climb your way up.

620
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,780
You're the only one
 who cares for me.

621
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,200
What are you thinking about?

622
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,310
Didn't you come to 
clear your head?

623
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,710
I know.

624
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,970
The harder I try to clear my head,

625
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,940
the more it gets filled.

626
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,850
How about that bastard?

627
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,290
We're done emotionally,

628
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,690
but we're still together on paper.

629
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,570
Before this...

630
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:05,180
when I saw women who won't 
divorce their cheating husbands,

631
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,730
I thought, "Why hold onto
 a dead relationship?"

632
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,710
I couldn't understand it.

633
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,970
But I understand now.

634
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,070
All I have left is hatred.

635
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,170
If I'm going to be unhappy,

636
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,000
I want him to be as 
miserable as possible.

637
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,690
It's because it's still not over.

638
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:38,590
The tip of that knife will 
get dull someday.

639
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,860
See the end to it.

640
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,750
You don't know what's at the end,

641
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,590
but it won't be over 
until you see the end.

642
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,700
 

643
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:46,250
I'll step out for a second.

644
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:06,980
Mom...

645
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,940
Is it nice over there?

646
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,010
I...

647
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,590
I feel so lonely...

648
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,860
because you're gone.

649
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,280
Now I have a larger family than

650
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,160
just the two of us, but...

651
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,450
I'm lonelier for some reason.

652
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,660
But don't worry too much.

653
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,900
I'll be okay...

654
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,980
since I have him.

655
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,310
Yes, Mother.

656
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,990
I made kimchi.

657
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,210
I'd like to bring you some.

658
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,260
Meet me in front of the 
house when I call you.

659
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,490
No, Mother...

660
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,510
No one's home right now.

661
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:30,990
I'll pick it up later.

662
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,790
Are you out with Jung Sun?

663
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,280
 I'll leave it with the security. 
Pick it up later. 

664
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,280
It'll taste bad if you 
leave it out too long.

665
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,170
You have to put it in the fridge now.

666
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,210
There's no room in our fridge.

667
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,710
No.

668
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,480
It's heavy. I'll stop by to get it later.

669
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,450
It's okay. It's not that heavy.

670
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:52,970
Don't. Please stay home.

671
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,660
I'll call you back after I'm done.

672
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,800
Okay then.

673
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,960
You should go.

674
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,040
Mother is waiting.

675
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,640
Come on in.

676
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,280
Take this with you.

677
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,730
Kimchi turned out well this year.

678
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,260
I gave you plenty.

679
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,260
Give it to your father-in-law, too.

680
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,610
I wonder if he'll like it.

681
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,930
How's Jung Sun feeling these days?

682
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,950
She didn't look so well
 last time I saw her.

683
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,380
I found a good herbal 
medicine place.

684
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,590
Tell her to come by, 
so we can go together.

685
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,690
Mother.

686
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:01,920
I have something to tell you.

687
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,540
I'm sorry.

688
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,970
What kind of nonsense is this...

689
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:20,020
Why are you guys getting divorced?

690
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,690
 My friend said she 
might get a divorce. 

691
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,510
 Her husband cheated on her, 

692
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,370
 but he wants to get a divorce. 

693
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,760
By chance...

694
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,390
are you seeing another woman?

695
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,370
You're not, are you?

696
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,430
How could you...

697
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,500
Gosh...

698
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,020
How could you do that?
 How could you?

699
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,980
You saw how I lived!

700
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,710
How could you do that?

701
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,500
How could you do that? 
How could you?

702
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,980
 

703
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:36,630
 

704
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,260
 She's the mistress of 
VP Ha Jae Woong of Sung Un. 

705
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,760
 Even his wife knows 
but plays ignorant. 

706
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,220
 A long-term relationship. 

707
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:57,630
You don't know what 
you've done, do you?

708
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,730
Yes, you couldn't have 
done it if you knew.

709
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,660
When you first brought 
Jung Sun home,

710
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,730
I was so relieved.

711
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,850
It was because she's 
so kind and lovely,

712
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,000
but that wasn't the only reason.

713
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:32,330
It seemed like she 
meant a world to you.

714
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,580
That's why.

715
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,900
I thought, "With her...

716
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,300
he won't live an 
unstable life like mine.

717
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,260
He'd live a more grounded life."

718
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,120
That made me so happy.

719
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,640
Yes.

720
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,720
You probably think your 
passion is love now.

721
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,610
You know you're 
jumping into the fire,

722
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,420
but you can't help it.

723
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,740
Who could I blame?

724
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,480
You just took after your parents.

725
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,010
But you...

726
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,740
lost the whole world

727
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,140
because of momentary feelings.

728
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,320
Right now,

729
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,040
you don't know what you've lost.

730
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,320
You don't know what you've lost.

731
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,900
Thank you for meeting me.

732
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,570
Talk to me.

733
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,700
Last time, you mentioned...

734
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,140
the relationship between the
 VP and Park Sung Joon.

735
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,510
Does it have to do with
 someone named Lee Soo Jung?

736
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,960
You came to me faster
 than I thought.

737
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,540
Park Sung Joon...

738
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,780
takes care of my 
husband's mistresses.

739
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,560
He pays them off,

740
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,610
makes them sign 
a confidentiality agreement.

741
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:32,540
Stuff like that.

742
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,420
He's gotten rid of quite a few.

743
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,100
He's pretty good and tidy at his job.

744
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,570
You seem shocked already.

745
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,090
My husband doesn't
 trust other people.

746
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,640
But...

747
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,410
I guess he trusts 
Mr. Park quite a bit.

748
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,320
My husband...

749
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,320
has stocks under borrowed 
names to own more shares.

750
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,070
Mr. Park manages them for him.

751
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,700
Lee Soo Jung and Mr. Park 
own them as well.

752
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,460
You didn't know anything 
about your husband.

753
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,890
Are you interested in revealing that?

754
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:31,220
If you reveal...

755
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,700
both adultery and 
borrowed-name stocks,

756
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,190
Mr. Park and On Yoo Ri
 will both crumble.

757
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,960
Don't you want to...

758
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,590
destroy both of them?

759
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,680
That means the VP will crumble, too.

760
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,610
 Park Sung Joon... 

761
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,990
 takes care of my 
husband's mistresses. 

762
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,030
 He's gotten rid of quite a few. 

763
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,440
 My husband... 

764
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,950
 has stocks under borrowed 
names to own more shares. 

765
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,600
 Mr. Park manages them for him. 

766
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,940
 Lee Soo Jung and Mr. Park
 own them as well. 

767
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,760
 

768
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,530
♫  With all that smile on your face  ♫

769
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:53,480
♫  Thinking there's no turning back  ♫

770
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,990
♫  And I’ll be shameless  ♫

771
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:03,250
♫  Waiting for Hades waltz with you  ♫

772
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:09,630
♫  I want to push you
 in the darkness  ♫

773
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,380
♫  What a shame on you  ♫

774
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,470
 I have no idea who you are. 

775
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,700
 How far will you go? 
I wish you'd go all the way. 

776
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,200
 Let's talk after the event tonight. 

777
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,600
 - Do you want to grab dinner after? 
- Depending on how it goes. 

778
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,500
 Can't you divorce him? 
You two are finished. 

779
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,900
 Don't come to me again 
with stuff like this. 

780
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,180
 It's none of your business. 

781
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,900
 - Jung Sun.
- What do I do? 

782
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,800
 Jung Sun! 

783
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,000
 Wake up! 

784
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,400
♫  With all that smile on your face  ♫
