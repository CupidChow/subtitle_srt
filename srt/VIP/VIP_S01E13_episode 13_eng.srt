1
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,026
Would you like to come in?

2
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,226
Actually...

3
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:57,066
I have a question for you.

4
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:01,976
That day.

5
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:04,926
The first time we saw each 
other after our breakup.

6
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:08,436
My first day in the office?

7
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,166
That day...

8
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,436
why did you do that?

9
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,476
Why did you send that 
text to Jung Sun?

10
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:27,896
I wanted to...

11
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,266
create...

12
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,186
a gap between you two.

13
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,716
 

14
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,766
I'll go in now.

15
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:56,036
Where are you?

16
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,996
How dare you send 
such a text to me?

17
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,836
You crossed the line.

18
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:50,506
You've gone too far, acting innocent 
while backstabbing me.

19
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,876
You know that?

20
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,086
Jung Sun.

21
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,586
Is that why you took 
away the CCTV?

22
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,236
So you could protect it?

23
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:26,896
Son of a b****.

24
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:30,476
Leave the team.

25
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:32,766
Everyone knows.

26
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:36,066
That you've been cheating 
with Park Sung Joon.

27
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:41,246
Don't stoop lower and 
leave on your own.

28
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,366
Get some rest.

29
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,306
It's my fault.

30
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,826
I was envious of Deputy GM Na.

31
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:30,946
My first day at the office...

32
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:33,386
Say hello.

33
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,626
Hello, I'm On Yoo Ri.

34
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,666
Enter here and type in 
your ID and password...

35
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,636
I've never worked in an office before.

36
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:50,496
So I don't know what
 the password is.

37
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:53,626
I'll ask HR what the 
default password is then.

38
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:54,776
Yes, thank you.

39
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,406
 That's when I realized... 

40
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:58,966
that I'll never...

41
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,196
beat that woman.

42
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:06,726
I thought, "How could someone
 like her be his wife?"

43
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:12,416
I felt so humiliated at my limits.

44
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:15,786
So I got angry.

45
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:19,946
I...

46
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,606
I hated that we turned 
out to be nothing.

47
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:31,966
I wanted to cause her damage.

48
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,196
Even if it's just a dent.

49
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,136
But...

50
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,356
 Done. 

51
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:47,776
 Your mother will be fine. 

52
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:51,106
 She'll get better because 
of you, Yoo Ri. 

53
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,886
 Pretty good for your first time. 

54
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:55,476
 She's such a good person. 

55
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:58,836
So I regretted it.

56
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,356
I know...

57
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,936
that I'm a horrible person.

58
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:09,666
But...

59
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,006
please don't hate me.

60
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:16,576
Please...

61
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,716
don't hate me.

62
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:02,766
 

63
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:13,186
 

64
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,456
Daebak.

65
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,336
Na Mi, look at this.

66
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:20,706
What is it?

67
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,266
It's a disaster.

68
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,366
 

69
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:26,016
What's going on anyway?

70
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,466
Dismissed?

71
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:54,576
You think it's all over, huh?

72
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,646
Just wait.

73
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:59,936
I'll be sure to come back 
and finish you off.

74
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,376
So what you're saying is that...

75
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,516
when you turned down 
Director Bae Do Il's threat,

76
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:52,496
he sexually assaulted you.

77
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,226
Is that what you're saying?

78
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,416
Yes.

79
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,926
On October 29th,

80
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:59,906
you took a video 
at TifÃ³ne's exhibition

81
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,916
and sent that to Director Bae.

82
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,146
Is that correct?

83
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,716
Yes.

84
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:14,356
The sales declined by 
10% compared to last week.

85
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,416
Sales among the 30s and 40s
 went down even more.

86
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,226
I'm sure it's just temporary.

87
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:22,966
Everyone is flipping out right now, 
but it'd fizzle out soon.

88
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,066
That's a public opinion for you.

89
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,846
In Yeojin Food Company's case,

90
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:28,786
the market share hasn't
 gone up since the

91
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,906
sexual assault case 
from two years ago.

92
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:34,316
Distribution companies that target 
the internal market like us

93
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:37,746
suffer more from issues like this.

94
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:40,776
The company needs to 
respond consistently.

95
00:10:40,776 --> 00:10:43,446
Let's think that we're cutting 
out the rotten parts.

96
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,796
Don't be afraid of things
 getting serious.

97
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:49,736
Because covering it up would 
only make things worse.

98
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:52,536
For this year's anniversary event,

99
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,246
with an unfortunate 
incident in our mind,

100
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,986
we'll do a small workshop
 for the executives.

101
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:03,776
The fact that Sung Un is fundamentally
 strong hasn't changed.

102
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:06,396
We've been working to 
achieve a competitive edge.

103
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,506
We'll be able to overcome this crisis.

104
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,916
Please do the best you can.

105
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:18,136
Director Park, see me in my office.

106
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,156
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,846
About Director Bae matter,

108
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:35,446
I decided to deal with it 
as you recommended.

109
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,366
So...

110
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,546
did you give it some thought?

111
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,716
I'm sorry.

112
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,536
I'm grateful for your offer,

113
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:50,426
but I'm afraid not.

114
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,396
You should accept it if you're grateful.

115
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:57,266
I've spent a lot of time with the VP.

116
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,816
We've had a lot of crises,

117
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:02,806
but he believed in me every
 time without a doubt.

118
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:07,036
I think I owe him for
 those times as well.

119
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,146
That's too bad.

120
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:17,016
For both you and me.

121
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,756
Manager.

122
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:35,776
I have new ideas for the gift card.

123
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,026
Just leave it.

124
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,416
As you know, I have 
a long way to go.

125
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,616
I still have a lot to learn from you.

126
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,596
Would you be able to
 keep teaching me?

127
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,266
This is not a school.

128
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:55,206
Why would we be teaching anyone?

129
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:58,116
You have to learn on your own.

130
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:07,046
This must be about what
 happened with Ms. Na.

131
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,496
Work has nothing to do 
with personal life.

132
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:14,666
I'm not interested in 
choosing a team.

133
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,166
But...

134
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,166
you probably can't...

135
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,866
have it all, don't you think?

136
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,656
The President said that
 to Director Park?

137
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,066
They say, "A rolling stone 
knocks out an old stone."

138
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,646
The new president thinks

139
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:58,456
there are too many 
old stones that are VPs.

140
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:01,396
Director Park Sung Joon was one 
of the stones that stood out.

141
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,996
So what could she do?

142
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,186
From her position,

143
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:06,766
she has to turn the VP's 
people to her side.

144
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,406
And if that doesn't work,

145
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:10,596
she'd have to remove the old stones.

146
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,246
What do you think 
Director Park would do?

147
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,626
Do you think he'll be 
on the President's side?

148
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,566
 That man will not let 
go of Director Park. 

149
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:24,566
 Those two are quite
 bonded, so to speak. 

150
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:29,516
Director Park will probably 
stick to the VP's side.

151
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,276
What are you doing?

152
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,366
I found them on the way here.

153
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,116
So...

154
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:07,096
Chocolates stop cortisol, 
which is a stress hormone.

155
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,299
And they make you feel happy.

156
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:09,320
Thank you.

157
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Fighting.

158
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,230
- Thank you in advance.
- Yes.

159
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,280
Did the questioning with 
the auditors go well?

160
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,290
Yes.

161
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,730
Yes.

162
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,690
You did well.

163
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,550
It got me thinking a lot.

164
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,730
I told them all about the video, too.

165
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,290
It's true that I did some wrong things.

166
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,440
I can't complain if 
I get punished for them.

167
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,690
But if I get punished now,

168
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,230
promotion would be difficult.

169
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:21,130
I wonder if I'd be a nuisance
 to the company if I stayed.

170
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,880
Honestly, while I was
 going through this,

171
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,170
I got to thinking, "For what glory?"

172
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,320
My stomach will get 
bigger soon, too.

173
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,090
I think maybe I should quit now.

174
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,750
Take a vacation and 
come back rested.

175
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,000
You've been going through a lot.

176
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,300
Have fun with your kids, 
and eat lots of good food.

177
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,930
Then come back.

178
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,600
Did you have a good chat 
with the President?

179
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,990
Yes.

180
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,540
The customizable diffuser
 that On Yoo Ri proposed

181
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,980
was well received by the VIPs.

182
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,170
We'll launch it officially next year.

183
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,650
Will you keep On Yoo Ri...

184
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,250
in the VIP Management Team?

185
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,340
The Management Team is 
still a core department.

186
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,910
The fact that my person is there

187
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,300
would make the President nervous.

188
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,040
I understand what 
you're concerned about,

189
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,070
but it's her job to survive
 there as well.

190
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,800
Yes.

191
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,530
But...

192
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,280
we should probably start preparing.

193
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,420
I'm so happy that
 I'm going with you

194
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,840
instead of Ahjumma today.

195
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,090
You'll get hurt. Be careful!

196
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,130
Hey, Yoo Rim.

197
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,500
The bus is here!

198
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,100
The bus is here!

199
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,330
Hello!

200
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,310
Come. Be careful.

201
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,300
Yes. Eun Ji, sit down.

202
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,240
See you later, Seo In.

203
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Thank you!

204
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,100
- Eat a lot! 
- Bye!

205
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,890
- See you later!
- Bye, bye!

206
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,620
Aigoo, are you a working mom?

207
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,400
Well...

208
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,040
I haven't seen you before.

209
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,670
Aigoo.

210
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,920
Moms are so fussy these days.

211
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,980
It's like they're sending
 their children to war.

212
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,970
Aigoo, it's okay!

213
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,430
Once they grow up,

214
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,090
they don't even want their parents.

215
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,750
You just have to love them 
a lot while they're around.

216
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,550
No one in this world gets
 to have everything.

217
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,320
My daughter works, too.

218
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Reminded me of my daughter.

219
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,950
See you next time.

220
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,200
Hello.

221
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,500
The office feels empty today.

222
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,100
Where did they all go?

223
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,160
The executives' event 
for the anniversary.

224
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,400
What? Hey!

225
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,570
Isn't that for married couples?

226
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,890
That's a great thing.

227
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,410
Aigoo. Thank you.

228
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,800
You didn't come with Ms. Na?

229
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,310
- No, she's a bit busy today.
- I see.

230
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,590
This is my wife. Say hello.

231
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,000
Hello.

232
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,950
Hello.

233
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,050
Hey, there she is!

234
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,680
Mr. Park said you couldn't 
make it because you're busy.

235
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,150
But you made it.

236
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,230
My schedule changed, thankfully.

237
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,450
- See you later.
- Yes.

238
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,800
Have a seat.

239
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,150
Look happy.

240
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,340
Look at the people.

241
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,910
- Jung Sun.
- I thought about...

242
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,970
what might torture you the most.

243
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,080
I'm not getting divorced.

244
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,200
- It'd be hellish for both of us.
- I told you.

245
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,760
Let's go to hell together.

246
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,520
Do you need anything?

247
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,600
Oh, well...

248
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,980
Are there comfortable shoes

249
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,430
for pregnant women?

250
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,410
How about something like these?

251
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,430
They have cushiony soles. 
So they're comfortable.

252
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,130
A lot of pregnant women 
ask for them.

253
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,390
Mi Na loves red.

254
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,090
- I'll take these.
- Yes.

255
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,860
What size would you like?

256
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,730
- It's 130.
- Got it.

257
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,900
Right.

258
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,910
Would it be better to go up a size? 
Her feet might swell?

259
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,670
Yes.

260
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,910
- I'll get them in one size bigger.
 - Okay.

261
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,860
Are you seeing someone?

262
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,910
They're for my wife.

263
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,030
What's in your brain?

264
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,770
Let's be logical here, okay?

265
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,300
Logically speaking,

266
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,320
why buy a gift for your wife
 on just any day?

267
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,010
We've been through a lot lately.

268
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,360
I wanted her to feel better.

269
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,250
Byung Hoon, you suddenly matured.

270
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,260
I think you'll go to heaven.

271
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
- You go to church, right?
 - Want to die?

272
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,200
Beat it, punk.

273
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,890
Who cares about promotion?

274
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,700
Why would you let him 
threaten you like that?

275
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,490
How long do you think I'd last if I don't
 get promoted again this time?

276
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,380
Just quit for crying out loud!

277
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,540
- What?
- Just quit!

278
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,680
I'll find a way to support the family.

279
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,580
Don't make it sound so easy.

280
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,970
You said you're stressed out.

281
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:03,120
Raising children and 
working at the same time.

282
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,050
Rather than going through this,

283
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,630
you should just quit and...

284
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,890
Don't make it sound 
so easy, I said!

285
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,840
Why do you think I'm 
holding on so desperately?

286
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,340
I feel bad for the kids. So why?

287
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,100
Sometimes...

288
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,260
I wonder if all this is worth it.

289
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,530
I don't know if this is 
really what I want.

290
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,310
I feel that way, too.

291
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,260
But if I give up on this,

292
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,450
I don't think I could do
 anything else.

293
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,900
So I'm hanging in there
 by a thread.

294
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,760
I know that hanging in
 won't do anything.

295
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,120
But...

296
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,650
I don't know what else I could do.

297
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,400
This is all I got for working
 hard in my entire 20s.

298
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,970
What else can I do?

299
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,890
I worked part-time 
during college to get a job.

300
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,730
And when I finally got hired,

301
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,040
I worked my butt off to survive.

302
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,550
If I quit now,

303
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:15,320
the times I spent working so hard

304
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,950
would all disappear in a moment.

305
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,670
But...

306
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,900
I feel like I'd disappear
 along with it.

307
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,060
I'm afraid.

308
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,130
It's such a blessing to 
be a mother, but...

309
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,130
I...

310
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,310
want to live as someone

311
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,740
called Song Mi Na as well.

312
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,030
Am I too selfish to think that?

313
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,450
No.

314
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,950
Don't cry.

315
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,140
It's okay.

316
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,540
It's okay.

317
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,830
 

318
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,730
The important thing is

319
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,250
that you don't need to tell the
 other person everything.

320
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,180
But you should be able 
to tell them everything.

321
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,980
So everyone,

322
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,520
may I ask you how honest 
you are to each other?

323
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,380
Let me ask the VP right here.

324
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,630
Sir, do you tend to be
 honest with your wife?

325
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,710
I'm trying my best to be honest.

326
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,010
I already know everything, 
even if he doesn't tell me.

327
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,190
It's hard to hide things

328
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
if you lived together for a long time.

329
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,430
Yes, that's true.

330
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,400
You're right.

331
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
If so, why don't I...

332
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,040
ask a question to the 
youngest couple here?

333
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,920
There they are.

334
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,790
Director Park Sung Joon?

335
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,090
So...

336
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,970
can you tell your wife everything?

337
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,270
Okay.

338
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,710
I'll stop right here for
 the sake of your family.

339
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,680
Ten rules for married 
couples, number three.

340
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,670
"You must not raise your 
voice at each other."

341
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,700
No, no. You do lose your temper.

342
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,880
It's hard not to raise your voice.

343
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,040
 Yes, probably. 

344
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,090
Ms. Na?

345
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,790
I heard a lot about you.

346
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,230
People speak highly of you.

347
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,930
I'll need...

348
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,570
help from competent 
people in the future.

349
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,530
I'll keep on eye on you.

350
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,340
Thank you.

351
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,600
There.

352
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,880
It's tasty.

353
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
It doesn't even compare to Dad's!

354
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,200
Are you happy that 
I made your snacks?

355
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,500
 Yes! 

356
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,230
You want me to make
 you every day?

357
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,160
Mom.

358
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,190
Is our family going broke?

359
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,390
Is that true?

360
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,600
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,190
It's okay. You can eat it.

362
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,470
It was really tasty.

363
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,140
Young Joon.

364
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,230
Should I...

365
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,770
quit my job and stay at home?

366
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,840
- Dad.
- Yes?

367
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,800
Is our family going broke?

368
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,290
Why would we go broke?

369
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,630
You have to make money!

370
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,140
Mom makes money, too.

371
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,100
You say you want 
Mom to be at home.

372
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,720
Are you discriminating?

373
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,680
That's Mom though.

374
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,280
If you're home,

375
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,090
kids would make fun of me.

376
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,070
Your snacks are yucky, too.

377
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,120
Geez.

378
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,320
Being a mom is...

379
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,630
a tough job.

380
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,570
When we got married,

381
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,810
I told Mom that I'd protect her.

382
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,810
But come to think of it now,

383
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,290
Mom was about to collapse, 
trying to protect us.

384
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,170
Is Mom dying?

385
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,720
Why are you so extreme?

386
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,740
That's not it.

387
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,870
Mom is working really hard to

388
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,090
make money and raise you guys.

389
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,350
So I'm saying we have
 to treat her well.

390
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,570
Okay?

391
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,680
This is very important.

392
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,740
I'll talk to you as a man to man.

393
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,860
Being a dad is...

394
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,670
a tough job.

395
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,300
If you quit your job,

396
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,140
will we go broke?

397
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,230
No, we won't. Just eat.

398
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,730
Aigoo.

399
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,900
- Are you okay?
- Hold on.

400
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,200
There's a personnel appointment 
announcement for our team.

401
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,700
 

402
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,920
 

403
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,120
 

404
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,900
Hey! What is this?

405
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,770
Wow, Manager Ha Yoo Ri?

406
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,460
Now she's part of the
 Ha family, huh?

407
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,100
And what's Prestige Team?

408
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,730
I heard they'll manage Black Diamond
 members separately.

409
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,540
How about the VIP 
Management Team then?

410
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,220
Seriously...

411
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,560
I can't do this anymore.

412
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:11,667
 

413
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,927
There's an announcement 
for personnel appointments.

414
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:46,717
The VP must've made his move 
before the shareholders' meeting.

415
00:32:48,077 --> 00:32:50,037
He wants to form a team with the

416
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:52,107
highest sales and claim it, huh?

417
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,227
Congratulations.

418
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:11,147
You're unstoppable.

419
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:13,417
Yes, thank you.

420
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,297
Your father gave you
 the manager position.

421
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:22,817
But how would you
 take her position?

422
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:31,647
Mr. Cha!

423
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,227
We're going out for a drink.

424
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:35,107
Want to join us?

425
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:41,897
- Let's go then.
- Okay, go!

426
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,667
Manager Ha Yoo Ri?

427
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,037
Are they crazy?

428
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:51,867
Is this a joke or something?

429
00:34:51,927 --> 00:34:53,867
What do you think, Ms. Lee?

430
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,257
She holds the same title 
as you starting today.

431
00:34:56,257 --> 00:34:58,237
How is the mood in your team?

432
00:34:58,237 --> 00:34:59,507
Well...

433
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:02,077
it was the company's decision. 
What can you do?

434
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,627
Mr. Cha, take a look at this.

435
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:06,477
This is...

436
00:35:06,477 --> 00:35:09,507
Let's say this is the VIP Team.

437
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,117
Our sales take up about...

438
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:14,027
60% of the entire sales, you know?

439
00:35:14,027 --> 00:35:15,967
It's the Pareto principle.

440
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,087
And what's the Black Diamonds?

441
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:21,967
They're the top 999 members who are

442
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,137
absolute top moneybags.

443
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,017
And the sales from those

444
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:29,197
999 people take up about 70% here.

445
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:33,567
Taking those moneybags away means 
eliminating Management Team, doesn't it?

446
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,767
Seriously, poor VIP Management
 Team is getting disbanded

447
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,637
because of the higher-ups' fight.

448
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,947
We're about to be
 abandoned by all parties.

449
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,277
Director Park can't do this.

450
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,737
I didn't think he'd be like this.

451
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:52,527
Are you...

452
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:55,947
doing okay these days?

453
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,677
I'm okay.

454
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,787
You saw that woman earlier, right?

455
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:12,627
She was part of the 
MeToo movement.

456
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:13,727
What?

457
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:15,517
Is she drinking with a man?

458
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:18,057
After completely ruining
 the company's reputation?

459
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:19,517
I know!

460
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,337
If I were her, I'd behave for a while.

461
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:24,407
Are these people serious?

462
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:25,527
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,507
Were we too loud by chance?

464
00:36:28,507 --> 00:36:29,577
No.

465
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:32,117
It looked like you were 
talking while looking at us.

466
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:34,497
I thought maybe we were too loud.

467
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:35,617
The thing is...

468
00:36:35,617 --> 00:36:37,917
If you have anything to say, 
don't talk behind our backs.

469
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,647
Please say it directly to us.

470
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,177
Or there might be
 a misunderstanding.

471
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:43,867
Yes, I'm sorry.

472
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,367
I appreciate it.

473
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:57,837
You're pretty impressive.

474
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,067
Nice job.

475
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:08,597
- Is the restroom crowded?
- No, it's okay.

476
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:10,487
I'll be right back.

477
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,247
The curtain's fine.

478
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:36,767
Did you wash up?

479
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:46,517
By the way, I think 
running away from home

480
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,807
can be good sometimes.

481
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:51,097
I've been sleeping in 
here without you

482
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,957
and now that you're back,

483
00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:56,897
I feel excited like 
a newlywed groom.

484
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:59,767
Should I try it next time 
to spice things up?

485
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,507
I see. I went too far, didn't I?

486
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,187
I should've stopped talking earlier.

487
00:38:03,187 --> 00:38:06,227
This is my problem these 
days. I talk too much.

488
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:18,687
Well...

489
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:20,507
What's this?

490
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,137
Open it.

491
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:30,147
Did you buy them?

492
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:33,077
Young Joon did. 
I'm kidding. I did.

493
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,407
Your feet get swollen

494
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,227
and it's difficult to wear 
heels, too. So...

495
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,037
Thank you.

496
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,967
They're just shoes.

497
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,767
Try them on. Try them on.

498
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,467
No, let me put them on for you.

499
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:47,937
Give me.

500
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,817
Okay, left foot.

501
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,377
Did you only wash your hair?

502
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,297
I'm kidding.

503
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:57,147
There.

504
00:38:57,147 --> 00:38:59,217
It fits perfectly. I was worried.

505
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,717
Good.

506
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,107
Honey.

507
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,677
Should I quit my job?

508
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:09,347
Because of what 
happened recently?

509
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,567
Just because.

510
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:15,077
Young Joon will go to 
elementary school soon

511
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,867
and this baby will be 
born soon, too.

512
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:26,327
But we'll need more money.

513
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:29,177
It'd be too hard for 
you to work alone.

514
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:31,927
Do what you want to do.

515
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:35,487
It's too hard for you to hang in.

516
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:37,207
Whatever happens later,

517
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,047
let's take care of you first.

518
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:41,587
I'm sure we won't starve.

519
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:47,667
Who bought you these shoes?

520
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,137
They're so pretty.

521
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,077
Don't wear them in the rain. 
They're suede.

522
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,157
Oh, my...

523
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:58,967
I think I drank too much.

524
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:03,407
I'll go to the restroom
 one more time.

525
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,767
Here...

526
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,947
 The unwanted guest is leaving. 

527
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:38,337
Manager Kang just said
 she's going home.

528
00:40:42,157 --> 00:40:43,167
I see.

529
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:54,337
Should we leave too then?

530
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,757
Yes, let's go.

531
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,807
Why don't we take a walk...

532
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,727
so we could sober up a bit?

533
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:24,427
I thought I was more 
talkative than this.

534
00:41:24,427 --> 00:41:27,047
It's hard for some reason.

535
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:32,057
I told you.

536
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,517
Just take it easy.

537
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,997
I know.

538
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:44,287
I wish I could.

539
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:48,617
I'm very grateful to you.

540
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:54,777
I'm pretending to be tough,

541
00:41:55,937 --> 00:41:58,157
but I'm barely hanging in there.

542
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,557
You said you wanted 
to be supportive.

543
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:09,247
What you said made me
 feel a lot better.

544
00:42:13,127 --> 00:42:14,577
I'm glad to hear that...

545
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:18,667
I was able to help a little.

546
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,147
I really meant it.

547
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:26,997
Things have been difficult lately.

548
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:30,937
I don't know if you'd want to,

549
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,117
but you can use me 
whenever you need me.

550
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:40,587
I don't know if I'd be useful.

551
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,487
 I had fun tonight. 

552
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:21,467
 Let's go for another 
drink sometime. 

553
00:43:44,987 --> 00:43:47,087
 Yes, definitely! 

554
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:01,297
 

555
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:02,657
Yes.

556
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:04,297
Yes, got it.

557
00:44:05,837 --> 00:44:08,717
Were you in charge of the partnership 
with Diaclaro Restaurant, Mi Na?

558
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:10,507
Yoo Ri was in charge of Diaclaro...

559
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:13,677
I mean, Manager Ha is.

560
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:17,997
Manager Ha is assigned 
to Prestige Team.

561
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:20,917
- Why don't you...
- I'll take care of it before I leave.

562
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,747
It's almost at its last stage.

563
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:26,627
I think that'd be better than 
switching the person in charge.

564
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:31,317
The visit was rescheduled for today.

565
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:34,637
You'll be going there with
 the PR Team. Get ready.

566
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:35,837
Yes.

567
00:44:35,837 --> 00:44:39,457
Sang Woo, check with the Planning Team 
to see if they reviewed the contract.

568
00:44:39,457 --> 00:44:40,627
Yes.

569
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:57,667
Isn't that Mr. Park?

570
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,677
What are you doing here, Mr. Park?

571
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:12,327
The Marketing Team will be

572
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:15,267
handling VIP partner
 contracts from now on.

573
00:45:16,367 --> 00:45:19,067
The Marketing Team doesn't have 
the right to make decisions

574
00:45:19,067 --> 00:45:20,567
like this without discussing
 it beforehand.

575
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:22,347
The VP approved it.

576
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,627
Mr. Park! I'm sorry.

577
00:45:27,627 --> 00:45:29,097
I'm sorry.

578
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:31,077
I went to the wrong street.

579
00:45:51,447 --> 00:45:54,517
What's the maximum
 capacity of this restaurant?

580
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:57,407
We can sit up to 30 people.

581
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:00,007
What's the age group 
of your customers?

582
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,917
It varies widely.

583
00:46:07,717 --> 00:46:09,247
Hello.

584
00:46:09,247 --> 00:46:11,827
I heard there's a rooftop 
area in this restaurant.

585
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:14,667
Yes, it's closed right now 
because it's winter.

586
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:16,277
It's open from spring to fall.

587
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,177
May I have a look?

588
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:22,107
You can open the door with this.

589
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:23,297
Thank you.

590
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,327
I didn't plan that intentionally.

591
00:47:23,347 --> 00:47:25,887
I wanted to die many times
 since my mom got sick.

592
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,257
It was because life was hard,

593
00:47:30,527 --> 00:47:33,437
but I didn't know why 
I had to endure so much.

594
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,757
I lived because of Mom,

595
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:39,907
but sometimes...

596
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:42,637
I wanted to be selfish and die.

597
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:46,387
But since I met Mr. Park,

598
00:47:46,387 --> 00:47:48,827
I had a reason to live.

599
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:52,307
It was my first time...

600
00:47:52,307 --> 00:47:54,767
to think I'm glad to be alive.

601
00:47:55,867 --> 00:47:57,567
That's why I wanted him so badly.

602
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,507
I know it's not a good excuse,

603
00:48:00,507 --> 00:48:01,977
but that's why I did that.

604
00:48:01,977 --> 00:48:03,297
You're right.

605
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,227
It's not a good excuse.

606
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:13,967
Don't justify yourself like that.

607
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:15,917
Stuff like that can get 
destroyed so easily

608
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,267
you'd be baffled.

609
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,347
You never know when 
Park Sung Joon

610
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:22,667
will find another girl like you.

611
00:48:56,597 --> 00:48:58,077
Yes, Ms. Na.

612
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:01,297
The door is locked?

613
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:02,687
 Yes. 

614
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:05,337
So ask someone to 
open it quickly.

615
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:06,947
Yes, I'm on my way.

616
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:30,187
Oh, no.

617
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:32,007
I think the sensor is broken.

618
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:33,877
I have to call the 
security company.

619
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:36,697
How long would it take 
once you call them?

620
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:39,097
It'd take about 20 to 30 minutes.

621
00:49:46,907 --> 00:49:49,027
It must be freezing out there.

622
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,777
They need to hurry up.

623
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:19,967
Stop acting pitiful 
and come over here.

624
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,367
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, thank you.

625
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,547
I'll go with Mr. Park.

626
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:21,767
Did you have to do that there?

627
00:52:23,037 --> 00:52:25,737
Jung Sun was soaking wet.

628
00:52:25,737 --> 00:52:28,347
I know you're totally 
smitten with her, but

629
00:52:28,347 --> 00:52:30,347
how could you be like that?

630
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:34,647
Someone told me...

631
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:38,987
that it's better to be evil 
than just to be naughty.

632
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:45,607
It's better to be clear for
 Jung Sun's sake, too.

633
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:05,467
Drink this.

634
00:53:18,227 --> 00:53:19,977
Could you be...

635
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:23,217
by my side tonight?

636
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:35,877
I will.

637
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:22,227
 Deputy GM of Na Jung Sun from the
 VIP Management Team is here. 

638
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:28,067
- Let her in.
 - Yes, ma'am. 

639
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:35,927
Have a seat.

640
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:44,817
What's this?

641
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:47,817
 

642
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,957
"The Black Society."

643
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:53,257
As you already know,

644
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:56,257
the reason the VP formed
 the Prestige Team is

645
00:54:56,257 --> 00:54:59,977
so that he could control the
 sales by the VIP customers.

646
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,317
So...

647
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:05,407
you're suggesting creating
 the top rank of VIPs

648
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:07,557
and throw a punch at Jae Woong?

649
00:55:09,287 --> 00:55:10,757
How interesting.

650
00:55:11,867 --> 00:55:13,177
I like it.

651
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:20,677
Is this how you take 
revenge on Mr. Park?

652
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:23,247
Right.

653
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:26,277
When you're in my position, 
people become your ears.

654
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:31,047
Do you want to use me 
against Mr. Park?

655
00:55:32,837 --> 00:55:36,427
I'd be helpful to you, President Ha.

656
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,667
You'll need a task force.

657
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,587
Yes.

658
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:53,847
It's about the VIP Management Team.

659
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:56,497
The team leader 
position that is vacant.

660
00:55:56,497 --> 00:55:58,447
Give it to Deputy GM Na Jung Sun.

661
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:06,717
The Black Society...

662
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:14,957
 

663
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:17,137
The Black Society.

664
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:19,367
It's a VVIP group that's

665
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:22,267
consisted of 99 members
 that are handpicked

666
00:56:22,267 --> 00:56:24,407
among the VIPs.

667
00:56:24,407 --> 00:56:27,947
We'll be providing them 
a platform where they can have

668
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:31,177
human connections, 
not just products for sale.

669
00:56:31,177 --> 00:56:33,697
It'd be like a social club
 for the highest class.

670
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:36,067
We just need them to 
spend money in the store.

671
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,597
Social status?

672
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:40,037
Reputation? Why do 
we care about that?

673
00:56:40,037 --> 00:56:42,397
If you select them based 
on something other than

674
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:43,967
the amount they spend,

675
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,697
the current VIPs would 
not be happy.

676
00:56:46,697 --> 00:56:49,487
If you can't become a member 
even if you spend money,

677
00:56:49,487 --> 00:56:52,417
some of the top VIPs might leave.

678
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:55,197
Or maybe the VIPs from 
other stores might join

679
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:56,917
just to belong in the group.

680
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,757
The important point is that

681
00:56:58,757 --> 00:57:01,187
you can't join the Black Society

682
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:02,567
with just money.

683
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:04,137
Exclusivity.

684
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:05,857
We'll be sending...

685
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:08,657
a message that says, 
"You're more special."

686
00:57:08,657 --> 00:57:11,637
It'd take something
 extraordinary then.

687
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,867
That's correct. That's why...

688
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:16,567
I'd like to start a task 
force for selecting

689
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,887
the members of the Black 
Society and its services.

690
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,197
I think the task force

691
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:23,057
should be consisted of the
 VIP Management Team,

692
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:24,907
who's been handling the VIP system

693
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:27,017
and the Prestige Team,

694
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:29,957
which is the new team
 in the Marketing Team.

695
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:50,067
What task force are 
they talking about?

696
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:53,067
Do they want the two teams
 to fight or something?

697
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:25,927
Starting today,

698
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:28,217
we'll be operating under 
the Task Force System.

699
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:30,257
Let's do our bests.

700
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,047
 

701
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:03,647
â«  With all that smile on your face  â«

702
00:59:03,647 --> 00:59:07,937
â«  Thinking there's no turning back  â«

703
00:59:10,507 --> 00:59:14,047
â«  And Iâll be shameless  â«

704
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,037
â«  Waiting for Hades waltz with you  â«

705
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:23,277
â«  I want to push you
 in the darkness  â«

706
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,367
â«  What a shame on you  â«

707
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,967
 I'll support you, Ms. Na. 

708
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:30,067
 If Ms. Na continues this, 
we can't tolerate it. 

709
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,767
 What are you looking for
 in your future spouse? 

710
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,067
 Someone warm and kind. 

711
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:35,467
 You already became one of them. 

712
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:37,977
 You don't know what you've lost. 

713
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:40,467
 Maybe Sang Woo is 
interested in Ms. Na? 

714
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,347
 Both Mr. Park and 
On Yoo Ri will crumble. 

715
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:43,607
 I want him to be miserable. 

716
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:45,077
 I can even attack you. 

717
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:46,387
 You're doing that already. 

718
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:48,137
 And I'll surely fight back. 

719
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:50,367
â«  On your face  â«

720
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:53,067
â«  There's no turning back...  â«
