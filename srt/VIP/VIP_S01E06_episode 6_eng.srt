1
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,461
Long time no see.

2
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,861
Her inflammation is high and

3
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,721
they found an abnormality
 in her blood test.

4
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:43,291
So more tests are needed.

5
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,291
It can't be anything serious, right?

6
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,501
But how did you bring Mom...

7
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,031
I'll stay here. Go home.

8
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,841
Why would you be here, Dad?

9
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:08,931
A guardian should stay with her.

10
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,131
Why are you her guardian, Dad?

11
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,141
Jung Sun.

12
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,791
I forgot everything.

13
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,481
It's all in the past.

14
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,981
Why would you forget?

15
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,011
How could you forget that?

16
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,011
She's the one who left 
us for another man.

17
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:32,691
Because of that woman, you...

18
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,311
Don't forget it.

19
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,391
That woman...

20
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,911
She's worse than a stranger.

21
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:00,941
Let's go. I'll be the one to stay.

22
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:06,601
It's better that I stay here 
rather than you. Go.

23
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:07,941
Yes, Father.

24
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,271
Please don't worry and go 
home. I'll stay with her.

25
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,511
You go home, too, Honey.

26
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,171
I'll stay here.

27
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,421
I don't want you to see this.

28
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,741
Go home.

29
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,621
Why did you meet Sung Joon?

30
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,721
Did you ask for money 
from him, by chance?

31
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,401
- No, well... 
 - How could you...

32
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:56,411
What kind of person do you
 have to be to live like that?

33
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,131
You were like this then, too...

34
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,901
In the end, the reason 
you come to me is money.

35
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:13,551
 

36
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:36,221
You grew up so nicely.

37
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:41,871
I knew your dad would
 do a good job.

38
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,621
What is this regarding?

39
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,491
I heard you're getting married.

40
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,211
Your dad told me.

41
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,451
It's not much.

42
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,931
Buy a suit for your fiancé.

43
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:07,531
It's all right.

44
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,921
If you don't have anything to say...

45
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,711
I'm not doing this to 
act as your parent.

46
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,411
Just...

47
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,841
take it as a congratulatory gift.

48
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,611
Other people give more. 
This is nothing.

49
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,041
I don't need it.

50
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,431
Then throw it away.

51
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,101
Let me do this for you.

52
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:37,101
I never did anything 
for you all my life.

53
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:40,211
Please let me do this for you.

54
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,511
Your mom?

55
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,151
She didn't pass away?

56
00:11:04,241 --> 00:11:07,361
I don't know what she 
wants me to do with just that.

57
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,181
But the really funny thing is...

58
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,161
that very briefly...

59
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,971
It was very brief, but...

60
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:25,771
I realized I have a mom 
who looks after

61
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,221
her son-in-law.

62
00:11:30,131 --> 00:11:31,451
Isn't that funny?

63
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,891
Jung Sun.

64
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,291
Thanks.

65
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,641
I'm so shameless.

66
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,511
Live a good life.

67
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:42,621
I want to live properly from now on.

68
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,151
Jung Sun.

69
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:51,481
This was it?

70
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:54,991
The reason you came
 looking for me?

71
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:56,871
Jung Sun, it's...

72
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,671
Jung Sun!

73
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,201
Jung Sun!

74
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:36,471
 

75
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:22,381
We ended up here today 
since things were so chaotic.

76
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:26,081
I'll hire a caretaker if you 
have to be hospitalized longer.

77
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:29,681
You're still my biological 
mother, so I'll do that much.

78
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,101
But...

79
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,261
I hope we never see
 each other again.

80
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:21,851
 

81
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:26,351
Ms. Na is out today 
for personal reasons.

82
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:30,201
Ms. Lee, please oversee any 
of Ms. Na's urgent work matters.

83
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,501
Yes, sir.

84
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:44,471
I was able to accept it

85
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,491
because it was Jung Sun.

86
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,671
Because Jung Sun has...

87
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,791
a loyal heart, per your words, Oppa.

88
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,341
And I thought...

89
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,381
you were the same.

90
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,751
Because...

91
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:08,721
you should be the same, Oppa.

92
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:13,631
- Hyun Ah...
- You should stop.

93
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,281
Before the point of no return.

94
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,371
Deputy GM, you're here.

95
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:37,381
I thought you were off today.

96
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,431
I finished early.

97
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,221
Chairman Daniel of 
Tifóne will arrive today.

98
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,951
I thought he was scheduled
 to come next week.

99
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:11,571
I got a call from Tifóne this morning
 saying his schedule has changed.

100
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,371
He'll decide between 
Myungil and us this visit

101
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:16,531
and sign a contract to 
open up a store.

102
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:19,261
We're the first store he's
 visiting, so hurry it up.

103
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:20,621
Yes, sir.

104
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,541
The second half of the
 year depends on this.

105
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,951
Make no mistake.

106
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:25,551
Yes, I understand.

107
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,581
The reason I want you 
on the executive team

108
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,481
isn't just to add numbers to my team.

109
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,121
I'm sure you know this, but...

110
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:41,221
our company is still conservative.

111
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,401
They're stuck in old-fashioned ways.

112
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,411
When the world is changing.

113
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:48,901
Things should change 
around here, too.

114
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,021
If someone like you 
becomes an executive,

115
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:54,321
that fact in itself will be symbolic.

116
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:58,521
Among the senior executives,

117
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:02,491
some are hesitant about 
you because of your age.

118
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,681
Show them with your ability.

119
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,041
Yes, sir.

120
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:16,101
I heard he likes to 
pay surprise visits.

121
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:17,861
The rumor is true.

122
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,901
I'm sure you've all heard this.

123
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,141
Chairman Daniel is very particular.

124
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,921
It's an important procedure
 for the Tifóne exhibit.

125
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,351
Please report to me on 
the progress of things

126
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:29,441
- right away. 
- Okay.

127
00:19:29,441 --> 00:19:30,701
Yes.

128
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:37,911
Do I have to change all the scheduled
 events we worked on for a month?

129
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:41,511
Is that possible?

130
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,281
You have to make it 
possible even if it's not.

131
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,951
Our team's second part of 
the year depends on this.

132
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,741
It's a top priority for the VP this year.

133
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:54,571
Did you work late for days on end, 
not knowing what this was all about?

134
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,661
Yes.

135
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:01,651
Sang Woo.

136
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:07,081
Do you know what the rich in
 this country love the most?

137
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:12,671
Limited edition.

138
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,381
 As you know, Sang Woo... 

139
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,081
 our store differentiates 
Black Diamond membership to 

140
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,021
 VIPs who are at top 999 of our sales. 

141
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,861
 Unlike our regular VIP credit cards, 

142
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,221
 the credit cards for the 
Black Diamond VIPs 

143
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,681
 are numbered. 

144
00:20:27,741 --> 00:20:30,991
 No. 1 for the client 
who uses it the most. 

145
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:35,261
 The numbers are assigned according 
to the amount of money they spend. 

146
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:39,031
 So that number becomes their status. 

147
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,651
 The chairman of Tifóne 

148
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:45,421
wants to deal with No. 1 to No. 99 
among the Black Diamond members.

149
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:49,861
It's the most special VIP 
event with only 99 guests.

150
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,311
But...

151
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,771
does it have to be the Tifóne exhibit?

152
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:59,121
If we do a VIP show with items
 you can buy anywhere,

153
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:01,071
do you think that'd be effective?

154
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,431
Tifóne is...

155
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,061
a high-end jewelry brand that is at 
its hottest in recent days in Europe.

156
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,181
If we bid successfully,

157
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,641
we'll be the first Tifóne store in Asia.

158
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,511
If this contract goes through, 
we'll receive ten limited edition jewelry.

159
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,051
Over those ten limited edition jewelry,

160
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:22,371
we'll invite 99 Black Diamond clients

161
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,781
and have an auction.

162
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:29,331
Limited edition.

163
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,191
Now, do you understand?

164
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:33,711
Why Tifóne exhibit is 
important to us?

165
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,061
Yes.

166
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:38,111
Then, what should you do?

167
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:42,591
Run over to the management
 strategy team and

168
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:45,141
review the contract, no?

169
00:21:45,141 --> 00:21:48,101
Yes, I'll go now.

170
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:51,651
That guy...

171
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:55,091
He must've graduated from 
a good school, no?

172
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:57,231
When will I be done training 
him, so he's useful?

173
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,171
Yoo Ri.

174
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:01,121
Could you help me if 
you're not too busy right now?

175
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:01,851
Sure.

176
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:05,181
- We'll leave for the airport. Get ready. 
 - Okay.

177
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:09,041
Please standby at 
Gate 8 in 30 minutes.

178
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,211
Yes, thank you.

179
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:14,401
When we arrive at the airport, 
I'll check the limo first and go in.

180
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:16,321
Okay.

181
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:20,881
Are you nervous?

182
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:25,061
I'll take care of the 
chairman by his side.

183
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:29,171
You just have to make sure
 there are no issues, Yoo Ri.

184
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:30,431
Okay.

185
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,081
By chance, if unexpected 
events occur,

186
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:35,391
just smile.

187
00:22:36,471 --> 00:22:39,281
You know what they say. "You can't 
spit on someone who's smiling."

188
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,981
That's universal.

189
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:53,711
I'm Jung Sun Na.

190
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:56,551
Deputy General Manager of 
Sung Un Department Store.

191
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,241
Welcome to Korea.

192
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,111
Nice to meet you.

193
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,531
You can speak Korean.

194
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,181
I did hear that you're Korean.

195
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:07,751
But I didn't know you 
were so fluent in Korean.

196
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,121
I'm Ji Won Park.

197
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,741
Deputy General Manager of
 Myungil Department Store.

198
00:23:13,741 --> 00:23:14,941
Deputy GM.

199
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,351
I thought you were
 visiting us tomorrow.

200
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,701
Well, I heard you're arriving today.

201
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,951
And just came by to say hello.

202
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,371
Did you encounter any inconveniences
 on your way here?

203
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,141
We were quite comfortable, 
thanks to you.

204
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,671
You're fluent in Korean, too, 
Managing Director Kim.

205
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,661
I'm glad you had a nice trip.

206
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,991
I'll take you to the hotel now.

207
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,291
I heard that...

208
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,751
you're very interested 
in Korean antiques.

209
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:41,211
We found an antique shop that
 carries lots of great items.

210
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,231
I'll take you there at 
your convenience.

211
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,741
- An antique shop? 
 - Yes.

212
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,831
Could we stop by there
 for a moment?

213
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:52,411
Of course, Chairman.
 If that's what you want.

214
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,701
Okay then.

215
00:23:53,701 --> 00:23:54,971
I'll take you there.

216
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:02,021
What do we do?

217
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,571
Let's follow them.

218
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:05,671
Since it's come to this, 
this means war.

219
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:17,031
It's been 20 years 
since I was last here.

220
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:20,541
I'm really looking forward to
 seeing how it has changed.

221
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,571
I hope Korea meets 
your expectations.

222
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,101
This is off balance.

223
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:34,241
There's supposed to be
 86 cross-section cuts.

224
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,391
But I see 87.

225
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,361
Treat it as defective.

226
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,781
 There were 86 when we 
did the third inspection. 

227
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:46,541
No, there is a cut at the edge 
of the bottom side, okay?

228
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:49,111
 That is barely noticeable 
to the naked eye. 

229
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,511
 No one can tell. 

230
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:54,731
 Do you really want to discard $100,000 worth 
of products just because of that? 

231
00:24:54,731 --> 00:24:55,851
It is what it is.

232
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,811
Treat it as defective.

233
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:02,221
Is it the workshop?

234
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,431
Hey, just relax.

235
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,591
Look outside.

236
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:08,671
Come on, it's Korea.

237
00:25:24,241 --> 00:25:25,581
Yeah.

238
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,411
It looks like we'll have to 
postpone the hotel schedule.

239
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:30,081
Yeah, all right.

240
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,211
I'll see how things go here 
and call you back.

241
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:46,191
I didn't know there still are 
houses like this around.

242
00:25:46,191 --> 00:25:47,341
Yes.

243
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:49,601
There are some in certain areas.

244
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,631
Could I stay there, too?

245
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:59,861
Is it too difficult?

246
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:01,071
If you'd like,

247
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:04,821
we'll look into a place 
you can stay in.

248
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:06,271
No.

249
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:09,811
We're supposed to take
 care of his schedule today.

250
00:26:09,811 --> 00:26:13,181
I'll look into a place for
 you to stay right away.

251
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,401
Please. Thank you.

252
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:16,921
Yes, we'll do our best.

253
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:22,311
There is a Hanok Village where traditional 
homes are gathered not too far from here.

254
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:23,941
Would you like to stop by there?

255
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,091
We'll go together if that's what
 you'd like to do, Chairman.

256
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,151
- How about a traditional house? 
  - I'm looking for one. 

257
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,471
Most of them are guest houses. 
So their rooms are small.

258
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:01,141
I'm looking for a private home.

259
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,911
Ms. Lee, I have the contact info.

260
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,751
Okay, hand it over. Thank you.

261
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,771
How is it going over there?

262
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:11,801
Those Myungil bastards. 
They have no business manners.

263
00:27:11,801 --> 00:27:13,791
We can't have Myungil find one first.

264
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,311
Secure the lodging first.

265
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:19,251
Okay. Call me when things are set.

266
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:24,381
Hello?

267
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,221
 Are you Kye Mi Ok's guardian?  

268
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,041
Yes.

269
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,881
 We have the test results. 

270
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,321
 I think you should hear
 this in person. 

271
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:33,191
Yes, I understand.

272
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,621
Are you okay?

273
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,631
Okay.

274
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:05,011
It must've lived more
 than 1,000 years, huh?

275
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:06,781
Probably so.

276
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:11,401
This comes to mind when
 I look at these things.

277
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:14,841
"You must've struggled so much.

278
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:16,981
Yet you survived like this."

279
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,081
If you count plant leaves,

280
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:27,291
around 90% of the 
number of leaves are

281
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,661
3, 5, 8, or 13.

282
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:34,941
It follows the Fibonacci 
sequence like that.

283
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:41,161
Nature may look 
irregular at first glance,

284
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:44,841
but there is a perfect 
mathematical balance within it.

285
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,141
That's what makes nature beautiful

286
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:50,141
and strong.

287
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:54,521
Ever since as a child, when I see 
something perfect and balanced,

288
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:56,631
I was drawn to it.

289
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:00,631
I guess it's kind of admiration.

290
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:05,771
I'm full of imbalance though.

291
00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:17,021
My father said this one day.

292
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,481
What makes a person beautiful

293
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:24,401
isn't the appearance, 
but the facial expression.

294
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:26,261
And the facial expression

295
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,291
comes from the heart.

296
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,501
I didn't understand what
 that meant for a long time.

297
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,331
But while working in this job,

298
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,461
I've come to understand that saying.

299
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:43,751
Ironically, I get to meet people
 who are close to being perfect.

300
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:47,261
I've come to realize what that meant.

301
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,071
What makes a person beautiful

302
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,081
isn't the appearance, but the heart.

303
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:05,461
You're very beautiful right now.

304
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,341
- Are you okay? 
 - Chairman, are you okay?

305
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:03,951
It's okay. It's okay. 
Everything is over now.

306
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:04,931
Everything is okay.

307
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,411
No, Daniel.

308
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,261
Daniel, Daniel, it's okay.
 It's just water.

309
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:11,331
He was just giving you water. 
Look at me, look at me.

310
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:12,371
It's okay.

311
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:14,101
Calm down. It's okay.

312
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,041
Are you okay?

313
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:22,741
I'll be right back.

314
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,311
The closest one is...

315
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:31,871
Let's call it a day.

316
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,491
Would you like to go
 to the hospital?

317
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:35,001
No, let's go to our lodging.

318
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,701
 

319
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:39,481
We found your lodging.

320
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,051
I'll take you there, 
so you can get some rest.

321
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,101
Let's leave in 30 minutes.

322
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,101
Okay.

323
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,831
Good job.

324
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:50,081
It must've been tough to find one.

325
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:03,971
I could do it myself.

326
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,461
Do you know how hard it is
 to look at your sole?

327
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:07,681
How could you do it?

328
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:09,701
It will sting.

329
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,401
I'm glad there is a pharmacy nearby.

330
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:17,271
You should go outside soon.

331
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:22,141
It's okay. She said we'll 
leave in 30 minutes.

332
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:24,221
It's a deep cut.

333
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,101
Go to the hospital if it keeps hurting.

334
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,811
It can get infected.

335
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,401
Okay.

336
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,631
It was crazy today, huh?

337
00:32:37,971 --> 00:32:39,831
Done.

338
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,571
This is how our work is.

339
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:51,371
Unexpected turn of events happens
 all over, here and there.

340
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:55,001
You can totally experience the fact 
that you can't control your life.

341
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,041
It's neat.

342
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:04,821
For someone like me to see
 a man like him so close.

343
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:08,011
It's so fascinating.

344
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:15,671
We should go.

345
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:36,251
I'm Team Leader Park Sung Joon 
of Sung Un Department Store.

346
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,541
Chairman isn't feeling well. 
My apologies.

347
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:48,901
No problem.

348
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,551
Did you have any inconveniences?

349
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,961
Thanks to them, we're fine.

350
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:55,101
I'm glad to hear that.

351
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,481
I'll leave now, so you can get 
some rest. You must be tired.

352
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:59,741
I'll contact you again about
 our meeting schedule.

353
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:00,831
Okay.

354
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,971
You worked hard today.

355
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,151
Huh?

356
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:18,491
Oh, no. Everyone worked hard.

357
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,081
Your mother...

358
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,591
will be fine.

359
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,201
I didn't order this.

360
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,611
The man over there.

361
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,471
Isn't two better than one?

362
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,851
Thank you for the drink.

363
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:18,241
Don't be so dense if you want 
your customers to come back.

364
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,211
Why are you treating me like a bug?

365
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,681
Sorry.

366
00:35:23,681 --> 00:35:25,131
I'm late, huh?

367
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,741
What?

368
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:36,981
Honey!

369
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:41,601
You waited for me.

370
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,901
I could manage that much alone.

371
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,411
Can't you just say thank you?

372
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,861
I never asked for your help.

373
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,461
I know. It's just that...

374
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:57,551
you seemed to be in a bind, 
so I wanted to help out.

375
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,831
I had no idea I'd get in 
so much trouble for it.

376
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,401
I'm sorry.

377
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:04,731
Thank you.

378
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,691
Don't you want to drink some more?

379
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:09,621
I don't think you finished your drink.

380
00:36:15,617 --> 00:36:17,807
Our paths keep overlapping.

381
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,007
Only a few people know that spot.

382
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:25,617
Are we meant to be or something?

383
00:36:31,997 --> 00:36:33,677
Do you not like men?

384
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:40,677
Getting upset at the
 unwanted attention.

385
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:43,337
What kind of bulls*** theory is it 
that says I don't like men?

386
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:46,937
Sorry. I'll rephrase it.

387
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,517
Do you not like me, by chance?

388
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:55,987
Of course, we...

389
00:36:55,987 --> 00:36:59,817
met at a questionable place at first.

390
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,557
But still, you treat me

391
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:05,357
extremely mean.

392
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,757
So I thought about it.

393
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:11,887
You're so cold to me even
 though we're co-workers.

394
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:14,957
Is it because I tried to flirt with
 you the first time we met?

395
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,767
Does she hate me?

396
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,617
I...

397
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,607
do think I made a mistake.

398
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:29,497
I'll apologize.

399
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,637
That won't happen moving forward.

400
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,747
It seems like you're drawing 
the line even more.

401
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:38,447
I think you need a woman
 you can party with.

402
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:41,037
But I'm not interested 
in that right now.

403
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:42,617
So...

404
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,597
look for someone else.

405
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:49,107
You're very interesting, Hyun Ah.

406
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,887
I don't need a woman to party with.

407
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:58,077
I just want to get close to
 a mysterious co-worker.

408
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:02,207
Then...

409
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:04,737
could I ask you a question?

410
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:07,117
I'm glad to hear that.

411
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,887
A question for me?

412
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,567
That day...

413
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,047
The day we met in the work elevator.

414
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:20,967
You stopped me on 
purpose, didn't you?

415
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:25,607
Do you...

416
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,507
know something?

417
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,477
I was hungry and asked to 
eat together. That's all.

418
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,857
I see a tumor in the CT scan.

419
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:55,257
We'll have to do a biopsy.

420
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:57,917
Take her home after the biopsy. 
Then come back another time.

421
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:59,407
A biopsy?

422
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:03,097
Are you suspecting cancer?

423
00:39:03,097 --> 00:39:05,977
I'll know better after 
seeing the biopsy results.

424
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:12,697
I'll stay.

425
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:13,897
It's okay.

426
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:16,457
I'll stay. You go home.

427
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:18,307
It's too much for you to 
stay here tonight again.

428
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:21,327
You were here last night and
 went into work straight.

429
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:24,777
I'll stay here. Don't worry.

430
00:39:25,707 --> 00:39:29,507
Make sure Mom gets her test.

431
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:30,837
All right.

432
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,227
Don't worry.

433
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:06,647
Sung Joon.

434
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,577
Are you asleep?

435
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:11,437
No.

436
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,767
It's shameless of me,

437
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:20,167
but can I ask you a favor?

438
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,507
Yes, of course.

439
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:25,647
Even in the future,

440
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:29,577
will you be by Jung Sun's
 side like that?

441
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:33,797
Why?

442
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:36,647
Is it too difficult of a favor?

443
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,867
No.

444
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:41,397
Of course, I should.

445
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:48,337
She has lots of pain because 
of this foolish mom.

446
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:53,397
But I guess there is God.

447
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:57,337
A man like you is by Jung Sun's side.

448
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:02,297
I'm so relieved.

449
00:41:11,707 --> 00:41:13,457
 

450
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:15,387
A dinner invitation?

451
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:16,777
Yes.

452
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:19,957
Chairman Daniel wants
 to invite you to dinner.

453
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:22,127
He even declined to have
 dinner with the presidents.

454
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:25,477
Shouldn't we still steer him to 
have dinner with the presidents?

455
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,137
He already arranged the dinner
 after declining dinner with presidents.

456
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:30,177
So it's tough for us to 
decline his invitation.

457
00:41:31,547 --> 00:41:33,447
I think...

458
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:36,067
going is the right thing to do.

459
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:42,037
He went through the 
trouble to invite us.

460
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,037
I think it'd be rude to decline.

461
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,977
I think so as well.

462
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:49,957
Chairman Daniel will stay
 in Korea for four days.

463
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,817
And the most important dinner 
with the presidents

464
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:54,197
was replaced by dinner 
with Yoo Ri and Ms. Na.

465
00:41:54,197 --> 00:41:56,207
I think it means he favors them.

466
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:59,647
So wouldn't it be better to 
go along with his goodwill

467
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,607
rather than ruining it?

468
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:05,467
I think that may work to our advantage 
to win the contract as well.

469
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,347
We'll do that then.

470
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:09,487
I think we should go as well.

471
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:29,197
Don't worry too much.

472
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:31,737
We're just sharing a meal together.

473
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:33,187
Okay.

474
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,367
Yes, Ahjumma.

475
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,087
Excuse me?

476
00:42:45,587 --> 00:42:48,987
Ahjumma, please hang onto 
her. I'll be right there.

477
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:56,857
Could you wait a moment
 in the office? I'll be right back.

478
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:59,667
Call me if anything urgent comes up.

479
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,307
Okay.

480
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:06,237
Didn't you hear that
 you need a biopsy?

481
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:10,247
Such loose lips.

482
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:13,497
I told you not to tell her, 
and you couldn't hold back.

483
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:21,847
Forget it. I don't need it.

484
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,897
I know about my illness.

485
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,487
Did you know?

486
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,647
I'll take care of it.

487
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,407
Don't worry.

488
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:33,257
How would you take care of what?

489
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,927
They say it's cancer.

490
00:43:35,927 --> 00:43:38,217
You should get tested 
and get surgery...

491
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:41,147
My life is precious to me, too.

492
00:43:41,147 --> 00:43:44,267
The surgery is scheduled already.

493
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,487
I had asked Sung Joon

494
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:50,537
for the money for the surgery.

495
00:43:51,857 --> 00:43:53,397
Don't worry.

496
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,957
I know not to be so shameless.

497
00:43:55,957 --> 00:43:58,527
I won't torture you anymore.

498
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,747
But still, that was my money.

499
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,947
The money I gave you 
for Sung Joon's suit.

500
00:44:07,947 --> 00:44:09,487
That was my money.

501
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:11,477
It's not your dad's money.

502
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,797
Why did you do it?

503
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,327
Why did you do that to Dad and me?

504
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:34,067
Your dad...

505
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:38,567
was the only good thing 
that happened to me.

506
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,697
But...

507
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:43,787
one knows how to sabotage oneself.

508
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:47,997
I wasn't fit to handle
 such a good person.

509
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:52,717
I hated being intimidated and
 feeling small by your dad's family.

510
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:54,997
I wanted to run away.

511
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:59,687
That's when I met that guy.

512
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,647
Yeah.

513
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,577
My feelings got the best of me.

514
00:45:06,577 --> 00:45:08,497
I had no idea what I was losing

515
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,317
and was caught up in
 momentary emotions.

516
00:45:10,317 --> 00:45:11,577
You should've held back.

517
00:45:12,987 --> 00:45:15,397
You should've held back 
with all your might.

518
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:18,137
I know.

519
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:22,327
I should've held myself back.

520
00:45:24,077 --> 00:45:25,797
Did you have regrets?

521
00:45:27,037 --> 00:45:28,507
I did.

522
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:32,737
I regretted every day, every moment.

523
00:45:36,287 --> 00:45:39,077
But what good did that do?

524
00:45:39,077 --> 00:45:41,177
Everything had happened already.

525
00:45:42,427 --> 00:45:43,817
You lie.

526
00:45:46,587 --> 00:45:48,507
Then you would've come back.

527
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:52,547
You abandoned us like that.

528
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,867
Yet I waited for you foolishly.

529
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:04,567
I thought to myself I'll forgive 
you if you come back.

530
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:10,427
But you didn't come back.

531
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,897
"Oh...

532
00:46:13,957 --> 00:46:16,227
Mom isn't coming back."

533
00:46:18,997 --> 00:46:21,927
When I realized that 
I was abandoned,

534
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:27,827
I wished that you were dead.

535
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:34,687
I could've at least thought 
about you and miss you.

536
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:37,867
I made up my mind then.

537
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:41,767
That I'll never become
 someone who goes away.

538
00:46:45,257 --> 00:46:47,657
That I'll never let anyone leave me.

539
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:10,767
I'll be fine.

540
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:14,227
People like me live for a long time.

541
00:47:14,227 --> 00:47:17,947
Just think that no news is good news.

542
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:21,117
I'll never show myself to you again.

543
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:24,177
Stay in touch.

544
00:47:25,237 --> 00:47:27,617
I should know whether 
you're alive or not.

545
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:30,947
Be sure to call me 
after your surgery.

546
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:34,377
Geez.

547
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:38,437
You're something, you know.

548
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,767
She needs some time.

549
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,707
I should pay for my sins.

550
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,167
I'll get going.

551
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,217
 

552
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:29,287
Will you be okay?

553
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,917
I'm fine. It's work.

554
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,567
Let's go, Yoo Ri.

555
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:35,777
Okay.

556
00:48:39,907 --> 00:48:41,627
Goodnight.

557
00:48:56,057 --> 00:48:58,087
Are you feeling better?

558
00:48:58,087 --> 00:49:00,347
I'm better, thanks to you.

559
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:03,347
Seoul is so nice.

560
00:49:03,347 --> 00:49:06,717
It's more beautiful than I thought.

561
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:09,587
Leah and I both left Korea 
when we were little.

562
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:12,477
We wanted to visit at least once.

563
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:14,887
We were both adopted.

564
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,527
I'm glad you had a nice time.

565
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:21,437
So did you study Korean
 on your own?

566
00:49:21,437 --> 00:49:25,147
I'm no comparison to Daniel.

567
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:27,077
Hangeul is fun.

568
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:28,927
Basically, the consonants...

569
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:31,107
were created based on the 
appearance of vocal organs.

570
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:32,437
It's easy to learn.

571
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:35,427
It's a logical and beautiful language.

572
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,787
I'm boring you, huh?

573
00:49:40,787 --> 00:49:43,847
Oh, no. No.

574
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:47,027
A dinner like this is a first for me.

575
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:48,997
I'm nervous.

576
00:49:48,997 --> 00:49:50,677
I also...

577
00:49:50,677 --> 00:49:54,817
can't make eye contact with new people 
and can't carry conversations.

578
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:56,537
I'm sure you can tell.

579
00:49:56,537 --> 00:49:58,947
Please make yourself comfortable.

580
00:50:00,507 --> 00:50:02,447
Thank you.

581
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:04,167
Yoo Ri...

582
00:50:05,277 --> 00:50:07,607
your eyes are very impressionable.

583
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:09,777
They remind me of black sapphires.

584
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:14,097
Deep and clear, but somehow sad.

585
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:20,247
I'm sorry if I offended you.

586
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:22,397
It was a compliment.

587
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,917
No, it was an over the
 top compliment.

588
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:31,577
You have beautiful eyes, too, Chairman.

589
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,127
Oh, no...

590
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:37,497
Okay, this calls for a toast now.

591
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:39,607
Everybody, raise your glasses.

592
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:41,407
Cheers.

593
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:06,717
 I'm going to tell Daniel that we should go 
with a professional CEO system. 

594
00:51:06,717 --> 00:51:10,617
 Then it's your job to 
promote me to the position. 

595
00:51:10,617 --> 00:51:12,577
Yes.

596
00:51:12,577 --> 00:51:15,107
Once I become CEO,

597
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:17,217
we'll be selling Tifóne.

598
00:51:18,647 --> 00:51:20,647
Let me know when it's done.

599
00:51:33,597 --> 00:51:35,317
Please ignore.

600
00:51:36,857 --> 00:51:38,467
I know.

601
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:40,677
I know what Leah is up to.

602
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:41,897
But...

603
00:51:41,897 --> 00:51:44,397
I need Leah right now.

604
00:51:44,397 --> 00:51:46,267
- But... 
 - I'm...

605
00:51:47,997 --> 00:51:49,997
afraid of mirrors.

606
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:53,397
At some point...

607
00:51:53,397 --> 00:51:56,547
I couldn't stand looking at 
my ugly self in the mirror

608
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:00,637
that was full of imbalance.

609
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:03,087
For someone like me,

610
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:07,687
Leah is the first person 
who told me she was into me.

611
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:11,517
Leah helps me move forward.

612
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:17,767
Without Leah, there wouldn't
 be Tifóne today.

613
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,767
I know Leah changed.

614
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:22,577
But that's okay.

615
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:26,057
Because I need Leah.

616
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:29,627
Please pretend not to know.

617
00:52:31,577 --> 00:52:34,267
Please, I beg you.

618
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:38,287
Yes.

619
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,327
I'll go back in first.

620
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:09,107
I hate beans.

621
00:53:09,107 --> 00:53:11,217
It tastes like medicine.

622
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,797
It's good for you.

623
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:18,647
It looks like the red pill.

624
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:27,827
Was the red pill that
 reveals the truth?

625
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:31,737
If you take the blue pill, you can stay 
in the world you want to believe in.

626
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:35,707
If you take the red pill, 
you can learn the truth.

627
00:53:35,707 --> 00:53:37,667
After watching this movie,

628
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:40,377
I thought the protagonist 
was foolish.

629
00:53:40,377 --> 00:53:44,467
He'd be at peace if he
 took the blue pill.

630
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:47,547
I heard there's a saying in Korea.

631
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,427
"Ignorance is bliss."

632
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:58,597
I used to think that when
 I first watched this movie.

633
00:53:59,777 --> 00:54:02,437
But this is what I think these days.

634
00:54:03,927 --> 00:54:06,427
What would be worse?

635
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:12,817
Could you call it real when you're
 living a life ignorant of the truth?

636
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:19,877
It could be simpler than you think.

637
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:23,337
Wouldn't it be about what you want?

638
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:33,047
Would it be okay if you 
get what you want?

639
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:42,597
Wouldn't it be better than 
not getting what you want?

640
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:51,377
I don't know.

641
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:53,677
I guess so.

642
00:54:56,947 --> 00:54:58,357
Jung Sun...

643
00:54:58,357 --> 00:55:01,897
which would you choose 
between red and blue pills?

644
00:55:06,277 --> 00:55:08,327
I'm not so sure.

645
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:14,167
But do blue pills really exist in reality?

646
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:20,177
In real life, truth always 
comes to light in the end.

647
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:32,597
Things are getting too serious.

648
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:35,647
I just hate red beans. That's all.

649
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:06,027
Young Joon is not eating his veggies.

650
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:08,357
So he's constipated.

651
00:56:08,357 --> 00:56:11,147
How does a five-year-old kid 
get constipation?

652
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,367
I had no idea.

653
00:56:13,367 --> 00:56:16,897
Seo Joon was happy that 
he gets to eat ramen at first,

654
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:18,587
but since it's too often...

655
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:20,747
he doesn't want it anymore. 
He wants rice.

656
00:56:21,907 --> 00:56:23,967
So I was trying to make him rice,

657
00:56:25,327 --> 00:56:27,837
but I didn't know where it was.

658
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:32,037
You're right, Honey.

659
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,497
I was too much.

660
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:38,907
Since you're not there...

661
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:41,627
the house is a mess.

662
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:44,427
We shouldn't fall apart

663
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:46,507
because you're not there.

664
00:56:46,507 --> 00:56:48,947
But it's a mess without you.

665
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,197
I'm making an effort not to fall apart.

666
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:55,207
I know where the rice is now,

667
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:58,287
and I know how to feed 
Young Joon his veggies.

668
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:02,047
I'll make more of an effort.

669
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:05,797
So Mi Na...

670
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:09,907
Please come back now.

671
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:12,547
I really miss having you at home.

672
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:13,687
Huh?

673
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:19,147
No.

674
00:57:22,187 --> 00:57:23,797
Not yet.

675
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:47,087
Ms. Na, I think you're amazing.

676
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:52,137
You held a conversation with
 them on equal footing.

677
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:57,697
My head went blank. I don't 
even know what I said.

678
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:01,297
You did well, Yoo Ri.

679
00:58:01,297 --> 00:58:04,677
Thanks to you, everyone
 laughed with ease.

680
00:58:09,247 --> 00:58:12,297
Sir, can you stop right here?

681
00:58:12,297 --> 00:58:13,777
Yoo Ri, go on.

682
00:58:13,777 --> 00:58:15,697
I'll walk from here.

683
00:58:16,677 --> 00:58:18,007
Pay the fare with this.

684
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:21,007
- No, I...
- I'll expense it anyway.

685
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:22,197
Goodnight.

686
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:41,137
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

687

♫  I can't put a stop to it  ♫

Let's talk.

698
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:46,827
♫  Set me free from
 these nightmares  ♫

699
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:49,557
Hello.

700
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:51,797
What brings you by so late?

701
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:54,307
I'm just swinging by real quick.

702
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:57,857
Maybe it's the nice weather. 
She's in good condition.

703
00:59:57,857 --> 00:59:59,777
Thank you.

704
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:23,717
Mom, I'm here.

705
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:27,257
Hello.

706
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:06,597
I wish you'd tell me
 you're okay, Mom.

707
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:58,307
 

708
01:03:42,187 --> 01:03:43,677
I'll get going.

709
01:03:43,677 --> 01:03:45,737
You paid for a year's worth of
 hospital bills in advance.

710
01:03:45,737 --> 01:03:47,717
You were struggling because 
of the hospital bills.

711
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:49,277
I'm so happy for you.

712
01:03:49,277 --> 01:03:52,947
Did you win the lottery or something?

713
01:03:52,947 --> 01:03:55,817
Someone I know helped me out.

714
01:03:55,817 --> 01:03:57,427
Someone who?

715
01:03:57,427 --> 01:03:59,777
This isn't something
 just anyone would...

716
01:03:59,777 --> 01:04:02,887
What a relief not to worry 
about the hospital bills.

717
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:05,587
Please take good care of my mom.

718
01:04:09,507 --> 01:04:11,747
Maybe she really won the lottery?

719
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,397
Aigoo...

720
01:04:28,357 --> 01:04:30,547
I received this text.

721
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,367
 

722
01:04:43,477 --> 01:04:45,487
I wanted to ignore it...

723
01:04:47,437 --> 01:04:49,997
I really did, but...

724
01:04:49,997 --> 01:04:53,167
that made it bigger in my mind.

725
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,377
I have to know.

726
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:02,777
I must know about the woman...

727
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:06,017
you were involved with.

728
01:05:18,277 --> 01:05:21,177
 

729
01:05:21,177 --> 01:05:25,027
♫  Seizing for the truth  ♫

730
01:05:25,027 --> 01:05:31,697
♫  But now we realize 
what's right, nothing's right  ♫

731
01:05:31,697 --> 01:05:39,347
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫

732
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:43,197
♫  Pretend to be fine, 
but nothing's right  ♫

733
01:05:43,197 --> 01:05:48,207
♫  No lie  ♫

734
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:49,427
 I think about it every day. 

735
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:51,647
 You took that woman's hand in yours. 

736
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,177
 And touched her face. 

737
01:05:53,177 --> 01:05:55,687
 Would you have whispered 
"I love you" while doing so? 

738
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:57,937
 - Jung Sun...
- Did you carry out my order? 

739
01:05:57,937 --> 01:05:59,757
 It'll be taken care of soon. 

740
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:02,167
 It's over for me. 

741
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:03,677
 So you end it, too. 

742
01:06:03,677 --> 01:06:05,527
 Are you sure you won't regret it? 

743
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:07,167
 Don't think you can avoid it. 

744
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:08,627
 I have no intention of stepping back. 

745
01:06:08,627 --> 01:06:11,887
♫  Pretend to be fine, 
but nothing's right  ♫

746
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:15,397
♫  No lie  ♫
