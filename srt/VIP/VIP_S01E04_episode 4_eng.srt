1
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,371
I think you should wake up now.

2
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,291
What time is it?

3
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,131
You're all ready to go?

4
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,441
I have matters to tend to.

5
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,801
Get up and wash up.

6
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,721
I don't want to get up...

7
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,081
Little Miss Na Jung Sun,
 it's time to get up.

8
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:43,901
There you go.

9
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,941
I'm not a little miss.

10
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,621
I'm an adult.

11
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,101
I have to go to work.

12
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,551
That's enough for today.

13
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,351
At this point?

14
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,141
Seriously?

15
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,531
I have to submit a report this morning.

16
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,061
Fine, another time then.

17
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:58,461
I made you some toast.

18
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,161
- Wash up and eat.
- Okay.

19
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,041
I made breakfast.

20
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,561
Wash up and eat.

21
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,711
Okay.

22
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:49,211
 

23
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,201
 

24
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,951
 Is it someone I know? 

25
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,241
 No. 

26
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:39,041
Ms. Na.

27
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:41,221
Huh?

28
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:45,511
Is this invoice okay to submit?

29
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,421
Oh, leave it here.

30
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:55,871
Assistant Manager Lee.

31
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,161
Are you here for Mi Na?

32
00:05:57,161 --> 00:06:00,201
Yes, I have to tell her something.
 I'll borrow her for a minute.

33
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,591
Hey.

34
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,341
Where the heck are you staying?

35
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,211
None of your business.

36
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,221
Did you really abandon us and leave?

37
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:32,941
 Were you waiting for me? 

38
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,021
 Yeah. 

39
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,961
 Have a seat. 

40
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,401
 Okay. 

41
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,571
 What's the matter? 
You're scaring me. 

42
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,181
 - Honey.
- Yes. 

43
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,491
 I can't do this anymore. 

44
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,771
 What? 

45
00:06:56,771 --> 00:06:58,961
 I'm leaving. 

46
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,301
- What?
- I've done enough,

47
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,921
and I've been patient.

48
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,131
I have one body.

49
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,641
How can I do housework, raise kids,
 and work all by myself?

50
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,441
I help out a lot, too...

51
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,951
Are you raising a stranger's kids?

52
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:14,031
Help out? They are your kids.

53
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,691
I asked you to help me out this year.

54
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:19,791
This is an important year 
for me, so I asked for help.

55
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,461
But you haven't changed at all.

56
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,151
I'm sorry, okay?

57
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,601
I'll do better.

58
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,171
So don't say that and 
stop being mad.

59
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:30,221
These are not empty words.

60
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:33,001
If words don't work, 
I'll have to take action.

61
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,731
I've been slave-driving 
myself as a working mom.

62
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,501
Now you be a working 
daddy by yourself.

63
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,001
Why are you doing this? I'm...

64
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,721
getting scared.

65
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,421
This is scary for you, huh?

66
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:51,591
I'm more scared I'll fall apart
 if I keep living like this.

67
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,131
What should I tell the kids?

68
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:58,151
I had a hard time making
 excuses this morning.

69
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,941
- I'll say I got transferred out of Seoul.
- What?

70
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:06,731
How long have you been
 planning this?

71
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:10,141
Since you stopped listening to me.

72
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,321
What will you tell our parents?

73
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:14,921
Tell them.

74
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:16,661
If you want a divorce.

75
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:22,751
She's too fierce.

76
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,701
 

77
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,941
After this project wraps up,

78
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,451
I'm considering you 
for the management team.

79
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:39,991
One needs the power to 
bring about changes.

80
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,681
Thank you.

81
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,681
Yes.

82
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:45,301
Keep that in mind and get to it.

83
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,231
I know you're not the type,

84
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,851
but don't create any 
unnecessary problems.

85
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,271
Yes, sir.

86
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,241
Goodness, Yoo Ri!

87
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:16,901
Mi Kyung unni.

88
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,301
I was wondering how you're doing.

89
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:20,601
Nice running into you here.

90
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,391
What are you looking at?

91
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,161
You're looking good.

92
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,371
I know.

93
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,701
You're in a different league 
from us who stand all day

94
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,241
till our legs swell up.

95
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,611
I don't know how to do 
anything, so I'm at a loss.

96
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,221
Visit us sometime.

97
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,681
Everyone misses you.

98
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,611
They're curious, too.

99
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,711
I'll get going first.

100
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:55,141
Why? You should eat more.

101
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,391
I'm done.

102
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,711
Come and visit.

103
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:03,851
What's wrong with you?

104
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:06,691
- You used to like her.
- I used to.

105
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,041
Who knew she'd turn 
out to be that type?

106
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,161
- She'll hear you.
- So what?

107
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,391
Everyone knows she has a sponsor.

108
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:16,441
I may not be educated 
nor have much...

109
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,771
but I know you shouldn't
 live like that.

110
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:30,771
- You're having a pastry for lunch?
- Yes.

111
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,781
I'm not too hungry.

112
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:34,461
You're working hard.

113
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,551
Ms. Lee is prepping 
for the trunk show,

114
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,211
so I'll review the product
 exhibition leaflet.

115
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,661
- Can you show me the draft?
- Yes.

116
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,891
Pretty good for your first time.

117
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:58,151
Manager Lee helped me.

118
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:00,351
Print out the image samples.

119
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,651
Since you worked on it, 
you present it

120
00:11:03,651 --> 00:11:06,341
- and I'll assist.
- Okay.

121
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,741
 

122
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,381
You want to join our team.

123
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,781
Your team leader isn't 
treating you well?

124
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:37,351
No, I'm learning a lot from him.

125
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,771
Then why come to our team?

126
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,811
You can learn a lot there.

127
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:43,401
This is where the overall 
marketing strategies form.

128
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:47,351
I thought I could expand and apply what 
I learned from the management team.

129
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,881
We need someone who 
can work right away.

130
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,991
What are your skills?

131
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,391
Yes...

132
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:04,121
I've been devising marketing strategies 
targeting VIP customers,

133
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,201
and overseeing the events.

134
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:09,851
- Hello.
- Hi.

135
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,831
Where is Mr. Kang?

136
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:15,801
Well, he's interviewing in
 the conference room.

137
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,241
I'll tell him you're looking for him.

138
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,151
No.

139
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,661
I'll call him later.

140
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,581
 

141
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:36,431
I think we should select 
one of these as the main.

142
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,281
Okay, let's do that.

143
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:40,981
But we're backed up, 
so it'll take about a month to

144
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,401
pick the design concept
 and get approval.

145
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,551
Can it be any sooner?

146
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,961
The product exhibition 
is a month away.

147
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:49,801
Considering the printing schedule,

148
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,401
we'll need it a week earlier.

149
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,011
Other teams say that, too.

150
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:58,981
I can't give special treatment
 for certain teams only.

151
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:02,461
For now, please check if 
you can adjust your schedule.

152
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,181
We'll be in touch.

153
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:12,951
Yoo Ri, you go ahead.

154
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,671
I have to go to the showroom.

155
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,211
Oh, okay.

156
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,051
Deputy GM.

157
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,001
You can adjust one week 
of the schedule.

158
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,221
That's her, huh?

159
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,551
The one Vice President placed.

160
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,151
I'm not sure of the details.

161
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:56,241
Do you know what that SOB, 
Team Leader Kim, said yesterday?

162
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,011
He said women are lucky.

163
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,391
If we smile and kiss up
 to the higher-ups,

164
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,331
we can shoot up the 
corporate ladder.

165
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:07,401
Women must perform 150% to be 
considered equal to men at work.

166
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:10,301
But if people take note 
of cases like her,

167
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,001
even that 150% will fall to insult.

168
00:14:15,841 --> 00:14:18,071
She's a high school grad 
who worked in the food court?

169
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,951
What about those who slaved
 away to climb up here?

170
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,221
I'm not the only one.

171
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:30,471
To work with her on your team, 
you won't get much cooperation.

172
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,271
Deputy GM.

173
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,051
Do me this favor once.

174
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,681
You know the VP is 
keen on this event.

175
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,511
Are you threatening me because
 you're in his department?

176
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,461
You'll do this for me, right?

177
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,101
Whatever.

178
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,781
Hey, did the meeting go well?

179
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,181
Where is Ms. Na?

180
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,801
She went to the showroom.

181
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,021
I see.

182
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,951
Aigoo, aigoo, my goodness.

183
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:17,131
Geez, aigoo...

184
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:18,801
Let's recharge with some caffeine.

185
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,991
I'll collapse at this rate.

186
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,091
Gosh...

187
00:15:26,101 --> 00:15:29,001
I want this to end ASAP.
 I'm dying here.

188
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:32,201
Whoa.

189
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:34,121
Assistant Manager Jung
 is leaving us.

190
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:37,041
I know. Caught having 
an affair with a co-worker.

191
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,781
Did Mr. Jung resign?

192
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:42,171
You can say he was practically fired.

193
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,101
I guess...

194
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:46,171
If the word gets out about an affair,

195
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,101
it'll be hard to work here.

196
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:50,201
The mood is such these days, too.

197
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,461
If these issues come up, 
you'll be let go.

198
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,211
So make sure your affairs
 don't get caught.

199
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:57,951
By the way,

200
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,621
his wife forgave him. Wow...

201
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,681
That's marriage for you.

202
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,881
He shouldn't have gotten caught.

203
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,431
If no one found out, 
it would've been okay.

204
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,301
They'll stay together anyway.

205
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,451
You must be getting old.

206
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:22,541
Don't you remember that two-timing 
SOB who dumped me?

207
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,571
 

208
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,581
 I'm Kim Jae Hong's girlfriend. 

209
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,411
 - Can I call you? 
- What the hell, seriously...

210
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,371
What? What is it?

211
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:46,671
That crazy bastard...

212
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:48,791
Hey.

213
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,261
Call her.

214
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,041
Call her and tell her.

215
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,051
Forget it.

216
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:57,041
From now on, I'll never cross
 paths with that bastard.

217
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,381
That bastard...

218
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:01,221
is a piece of s***.

219
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,281
I'll avoid him because he's dirty...

220
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:06,831
Yes.

221
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:10,781
I dated Kim Jae Hong for three 
years and broke up a week ago.

222
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,201
Oh, you dated him for a year?

223
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:15,211
Yup, he was two-timing.

224
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:16,801
Okay.

225
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,701
Hey! Are you crazy?

226
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,671
Why avoid s***? 
We should clean it.

227
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:23,401
So no one else steps in it.

228
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,431
Hey.

229
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,901
Hey, great job.

230
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:31,381
You were amazing.
 I commend you.

231
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,621
Man, you crazy b****...

232
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:36,001
- Geez...
- Eat.

233
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,371
Eat up and forget him.

234
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:38,791
It's good, huh?

235
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:42,711
- Whoa, it's hot.
- Wow, delicious.

236
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:46,051
You said covering up won't work,

237
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,691
and it's best to get it over with.

238
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:52,551
Our Ms. Na Jung Sun 
must be getting old.

239
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:11,801
 

240
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,021
 Does this person know something? 

241
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,081
 If a co-worker sent this... 

242
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:33,031
Here is the data I organized.

243
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,011
I don't feel confident 
being in charge yet.

244
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,531
Couldn't you do it, Ms. Na?

245
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:42,131
In turn, I'll do everything you ask.

246
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:48,061
 

247
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:04,321
 

248
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,021
 I'm having dinner with Yoo Ri. 

249
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,681
 I'll be a bit late. 

250
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,491
 

251
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:33,781
 Okay. 

252
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,921
You're working hard, Team Leader.

253
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:56,791
What was up last time?

254
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,291
What is it? Why did you 
make me an accomplice?

255
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,201
I feel uneasy right now.

256
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:05,061
Sorry.

257
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:09,021
What the heck?

258
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:14,761
Is it what I'm thinking?

259
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,711
Hyung.

260
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:24,351
I didn't know this would happen.

261
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:25,861
You're crazy...

262
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,601
What will you do?

263
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,151
I must turn things back.

264
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,801
 

265
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,801
You took good care of them,

266
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,711
but it's a bit old. This one will be...

267
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,861
one million won?

268
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,961
It's a limited edition, and 
only 100 came into Korea.

269
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:26,101
It's a limited edition,

270
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,831
so used ones sold 
higher than originals.

271
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:31,791
These...

272
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,381
should meet someone 
who knows their value.

273
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:37,501
Gosh...

274
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:39,981
You're an impatient one, aren't you?

275
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:42,621
I'll pay you the full original price.

276
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:48,601
Of course, with added 10% on top.

277
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,701
Yes.

278
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,731
Yoo Ri, continue with the
 leaflet draft. I'll help you.

279
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:14,341
If I do, we won't meet the deadline.

280
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,151
My apologies.

281
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,271
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

282
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:23,001
I heard the two of you talking.

283
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,721
I don't want to be a hindrance.

284
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,751
- Yoo Ri...
- Everyone has their place.

285
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,261
I should've realized it sooner.

286
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:37,601
I overstepped my boundaries.

287
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,621
Why are you so late?

288
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,161
Where are you staying?

289
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,111
Just here and there.

290
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,011
Mom, where are you staying?

291
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,961
It's not good for you to know.

292
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:23,621
Why the long face?

293
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:27,821
The creditors didn't 
come to you, right?

294
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,961
How much longer 
will you do this?

295
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:31,771
Just how serious is it?

296
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:33,631
I'm taking care of it little-by-little.

297
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:36,491
I'll make sure you're not 
affected. Don't worry.

298
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,681
Give me some money,  will you?

299
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,621
I need to survive, too.

300
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:56,431
Geez, really.

301
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:59,741
Thanks to me, you lived in
 the lap of luxury for 37 years.

302
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:00,791
So condescending.

303
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:04,261
That's the only thing you've 
ever done for me as a mom.

304
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,231
Money.

305
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,401
 

306
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,181
Are you guys doing something 
with Se Rin Shopping Mall?

307
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:14,501
The CEO is our client.

308
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:17,401
I heard their capital isn't 
good these days.

309
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:21,101
They were developing their 
own brand and overexpanded.

310
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:24,201
But their sales didn't meet 
expectations, so they're strapped.

311
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,691
You must've heard wrong.

312
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,091
Anyhow.

313
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,851
I can't call you for a while.

314
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,861
Don't worry regardless.

315
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:34,551
"No news is good news." That's it.

316
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,131
Okay?

317
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:39,301
Why leave already? Eat before
 you go. I'm hungry.

318
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:43,061
How can I relax and eat in 
a crowded place like this?

319
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,711
Wait.

320
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:54,481
Take it before I change my mind.

321
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,421
You take this.

322
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,341
Isn't this the only thing 
I can do for you as a mom?

323
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:08,381
Money.

324
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:12,951
You and your pride.

325
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:16,651
I, Han Sook Ja, wouldn't 
exist without my pride.

326
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,771
This is hereditary, too.

327
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:20,641
My baby, I'll get going.

328
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:21,711
Okay?

329
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:46,481
I have an important 
announcement to make today.

330
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,611
What? Important announcement?

331
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:51,861
My company asked me to

332
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,151
report to an office that's far away.

333
00:25:55,151 --> 00:25:57,231
I can't come home for a while.

334
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,421
In how many days will 
you come home?

335
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:00,771
Well...

336
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:02,461
about...

337
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,991
100 days?

338
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,601
What? 100 days?

339
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:09,901
100 days...

340
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:16,031
But if Young Joon and Seo Joon
 behave well with Daddy,

341
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:17,861
it could be even sooner.

342
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:19,281
Mommy.

343
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:21,881
Can you not go to your office?

344
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,551
I don't like you going to work.

345
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:25,851
Sorry.

346
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,431
This is important for me.

347
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,751
Instead, I'll visit often.

348
00:26:32,701 --> 00:26:36,311
Young Joon, you'll take care 
of your brother, right?

349
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:45,481
Honestly, just between us, you know.

350
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:48,231
You're the only one I can count on,

351
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,881
but if you cry...

352
00:26:49,881 --> 00:26:52,061
who'll take care of 
Daddy and Seo Joon?

353
00:26:52,061 --> 00:26:53,961
Isn't that right?

354
00:26:53,961 --> 00:26:55,751
Seo Joon, you too.

355
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,951
Take care of Hyung and Daddy, okay?

356
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,161
Okay.

357
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,331
I'm counting on you two.

358
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:02,311
Okay.

359
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,621
Daddy is lacking, but take care of him.

360
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:05,601
Okay.

361
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,891
You're really leaving?

362
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,631
Yes, I am.

363
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:26,331
I invited you to Young Joon's
 class group chatroom.

364
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,821
I wish you luck.

365
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:34,581
I wish you luck.

366
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,921
I have to go poo.

367
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,931
- Hey, what's up?
 - Ahjussi. 

368
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:07,851
You know of an errand 
service company, right?

369
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:11,451
Hey, are you thinking of 
looking into your husband?

370
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:14,651
- If so...
- Please track down a text.

371
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,851
 Track down the sender? 

372
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:18,321
Yes.

373
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,147
Sang Woo.

374
00:30:34,147 --> 00:30:36,157
Don't be greedy and take one.

375
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:43,577
Ms. Na.

376
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,047
These are it, right?

377
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:53,837
Hello.

378
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:58,107
Everyone is on it...

379
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,717
This is no ordinary event.

380
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,597
This is Cha Se Rin.

381
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:15,267
Ms. Cha Se Rin?

382
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:18,667
I'm Ha Jae Woong, the VP of 
Sung Un Department Store.

383
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,667
I'm Cha Se Rin. Thank you
 for working on this.

384
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,867
Everyone is in full prep mode, but

385
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,497
I'm not sure if it'll be to your liking.

386
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:27,727
- It's beyond my expectations.
- Really?

387
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:29,767
Thank you in advance
 for today's event.

388
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,867
Sure. I think it'll be fun.

389
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:33,737
Take a look around and...

390
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:36,577
She's not flinching at all. Wow...

391
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:39,507
Stop running your mouth. 
When will you work, huh?

392
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:40,597
Did you check?

393
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:49,967
Look around and...

394
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,757
if it's not enough, then tell us...

395
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:55,347
We'll finish setting up in 30 minutes.

396
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,087
Okay.

397
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,267
 Everyone!  

398
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,367
Finally the mother of
 all luxury brand "hauls."

399
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:16,067
 A private trunk show 
at the department store. 

400
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:21,427
Per my preview, today's 
"haul" is set to be at...

401
00:32:21,427 --> 00:32:22,617
how much?

402
00:32:24,297 --> 00:32:26,177
 Yes, that's right. 

403
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,197
500 million won.

404
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:28,847
I'll be spending 500 million won.

405
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,267
Woo! Applause!

406
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,297
A round of applause!

407
00:32:34,357 --> 00:32:37,227
If she were an actress, 
she'd be a huge success.

408
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,607
Remove everything
 from here to here.

409
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:42,457
That's it for our preview.

410
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:43,957
I'll show you tonight.

411
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:45,947
Come and see if you're curious.

412
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:47,127
Well, then...

413
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:50,707
See you soon.

414
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:59,747
- Shall we begin?
- Okay.

415
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,767
This is nice.

416
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,597
Wow, this looks really nice.

417
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:10,447
This area is for staff members only.

418
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:11,707
Can I help you?

419
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:13,577
I heard the debtor is here.

420
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:14,957
We came to collect money.

421
00:33:23,557 --> 00:33:24,587
Excuse me.

422
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,437
You can't just barge in there.

423
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:32,417
Let's talk outside.

424
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,067
I'll take out another 300 million won.

425
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:04,617
Yes.

426
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,807
They'll look into it and call me.

427
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:13,317
I heard Se Rin Shopping Mall is 
having financial problems.

428
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,447
Due to their brand expansion.

429
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,307
Why do you tell us that now...

430
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,627
I wasn't sure, so I couldn't tell you.

431
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:20,877
My apologies.

432
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,517
Will we be proceeding today?

433
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:27,157
I'll go and talk to Cha Se Rin first.

434
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:31,937
Let me know when they call you.

435
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:35,987
 

436
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:44,367
I came to collect, but who knew you'd
 pull a new 300 million won loan?

437
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,627
Here.

438
00:34:50,017 --> 00:34:51,667
Remember.

439
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,617
Even if you die, I'll follow 
you in the afterlife...

440
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,197
and get my money.

441
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:01,527
Let's go.

442
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:02,737
 Yes, sir. 

443
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:24,607
A slight delay.

444
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:26,757
I'm sorry. Let's get going.

445
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,957
You should cancel.

446
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,797
You don't need to do this.

447
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,577
Pay back your loan.

448
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:36,697
Do you know...

449
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:38,727
how scary money can be?

450
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:40,517
Those punks will chase you for life.

451
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,397
I think I know better than you

452
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,817
how scary money can be, Ahjumma.

453
00:35:44,817 --> 00:35:47,307
I bet my life on this.

454
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:49,657
I can't step back now.

455
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:51,507
You seriously don't get it.

456
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:55,287
You know the saying.

457
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:56,617
"Life or death."

458
00:35:56,617 --> 00:35:59,467
If you're willing to die, you'll live.

459
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:02,397
If I hadn't put my life on the line,

460
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:04,717
I wouldn't have gotten this far.

461
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:07,967
I'd rather die than go
 back to my old life.

462
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,527
You could...

463
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,377
- really end up dead.
- Let's see...

464
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:14,247
if I live or die.

465
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:17,647
Let's test to see if I have
 any luck left.

466
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:22,047
Let's get going.

467
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,327
We shouldn't delay any longer.

468
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,127
They're looking for you downstairs.

469
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:33,957
I'm going.

470
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:50,747
I'll put down 200 million won
 and will pay up

471
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:53,087
remaining 300 million won 
when I pick up the products.

472
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:06,937
Then...

473
00:37:06,937 --> 00:37:08,817
we'll proceed.

474
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,417
Hello, everyone. This is Se Rin.

475
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,827
Do you know what day it is today?

476
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,197
Yes, that's right.

477
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,537
Today is...

478
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:30,787
the unboxing day of luxury brand "haul" 
worth 500 million won.

479
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,417
And do you know where we are?

480
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:37,267
This is the notorious 
Sung Un Department Store's

481
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:39,667
VIP private showroom.

482
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,887
You've all been waiting,

483
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:44,247
so let's get started now.

484
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:48,177
Everyone, we've been watching 
all the handbag "hauls."

485
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:51,367
That's right. The fashion
 "hauls" remains.

486
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:52,637
From what I hear,

487
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:56,187
these are hot, new styles from the US.

488
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:58,307
The celebs love them these days.

489
00:37:58,307 --> 00:37:59,827
So I saw them a lot, too.

490
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,967
Let's match them up 
with my sunglasses.

491
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:04,217
You can wear them as
 a headband like me,

492
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:06,917
or put them here. Pretty cool, huh?

493
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,347
I think it's pretty.

494
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,277
I think I've just aged ten years.

495
00:38:47,277 --> 00:38:49,337
But it's over now, thank God.

496
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:51,217
The show may be over,

497
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:54,397
but if her shopping mall goes bankrupt,
 won't our next event be ruined?

498
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:57,427
She won't go bankrupt
 right away, right?

499
00:38:57,427 --> 00:38:59,267
We have to review everything.

500
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,097
Ms. Lee.

501
00:39:05,057 --> 00:39:06,757
You were amazing today.

502
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,327
Seriously, I'm not fooling around.

503
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:12,927
As a colleague...

504
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,827
You looked so great working hard.

505
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:19,317
I'm telling you from the 
bottom of my heart.

506
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:32,617
 Ms. Lee. 

507
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,767
 You were amazing today. 

508
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,267
It's been a while since
 I worked like this.

509
00:39:57,637 --> 00:39:59,747
Should we eat before going home?

510
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:01,497
No, it's okay.

511
00:40:01,497 --> 00:40:03,267
I don't have much appetite.

512
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:07,097
Even so, you should still eat.

513
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:09,687
Your favorite...

514
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,937
- sushi place...
- I said it's okay.

515
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:20,367
Don't try so hard.

516
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:23,927
It'll take some time.

517
00:40:36,287 --> 00:40:38,177
 It'll take a few days, 

518
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:39,897
 but they can find out. 

519
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:44,157
 Thank you, Ahjussi. 

520
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,507
The video is up.

521
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:06,677
Already?

522
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:11,107
Wow, look at the viewer hits.

523
00:41:12,217 --> 00:41:15,897
 It's a basic style with a point. 

524
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:18,677
 It's gorgeous. How much is it? 

525
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,597
 1.2 million. 1.2 million won. 

526
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,567
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 

527
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,737
That's Yoo Ri...

528
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:32,757
This could become 
a meme for the internet.

529
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:38,207
But there's a strange comment.

530
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,997
"This clip aired on the news, right?"

531
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:42,247
News?

532
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,507
 An event collaboration with 
S department store and a video creator 

533
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:47,957
  is causing controversy. 

534
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,867
 Ms. Cha, the star video creator, 

535
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:53,067
 spent 500 million won on 
S department store's trunk show. 

536
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,567
 As Ms. Cha's video 
continues to spread, 

537
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,527
 the criticism that it's 
promoting an atmosphere of 

538
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,557
 divisiveness seems to be increasing. 

539
00:42:00,557 --> 00:42:03,407
 S department store has
 not issued a statement... 

540
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:05,337
The public opinion is not good.

541
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:08,997
There over 5,000 comments 
about the article,

542
00:42:08,997 --> 00:42:10,887
but they're all negative.

543
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,147
Among them,

544
00:42:12,147 --> 00:42:15,627
many are criticizing our 
department store as well.

545
00:42:15,627 --> 00:42:18,637
We'll organize our statement 
and issue a press release.

546
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,777
As for the promo materials
 on the event...

547
00:42:20,777 --> 00:42:22,737
- let's modify them.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,527
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

549
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,397
Observe the situation

550
00:42:26,397 --> 00:42:28,757
- and report any issues.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:34,987
I'm scared.

552
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:37,117
What will come crashing
 down on us?

553
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:46,477
The public opinion is not good.

554
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,837
There's even a national 
petition for us to

555
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:50,967
apologize for promoting divisiveness.

556
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:55,337
What will you do about our image?

557
00:42:55,337 --> 00:42:58,227
This is why I was opposed.

558
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,667
We should consider 
how the citizens feel

559
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:03,287
and approach with caution.

560
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:23,057
 

561
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:28,897
Yes, this is Ma Sang Woo from the
 VIP Management Team.

562
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,777
The criteria for VIP client 
trunk shows?

563
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,147
Let me check and get back to you.

564
00:43:35,147 --> 00:43:36,357
Okay.

565
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:39,007
Yes, this is Song Mi Na
 from the Management Team.

566
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,437
Yes, sir.

567
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:44,837
The product list from
 the trunk show?

568
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,827
Yes, will do.

569
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:51,667
Hey! We have a problem.

570
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,317
The VIPs are calling asking 
about hosting trunk shows.

571
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:58,537
The T-shirt shown 
on the preview clip

572
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:00,567
is already sold out of 
our ordered quantities.

573
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:03,657
And many inquiries regarding
 upcoming products.

574
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:06,517
I think we have a daebak here.

575
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,107
Yes, Assistant Manager.

576
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,457
What a relief.

577
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:14,017
In many ways.

578
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:22,577
Hyun Ah.

579
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:30,447
Oppa and I had a fight recently.

580
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:36,917
But this time, 
it's different than before.

581
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:41,807
As if something's been shattered...

582
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:48,077
I can't recall how I used 
to treat him before.

583
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:52,067
So I don't know what to do.

584
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:55,247
You should split up.

585
00:44:58,097 --> 00:44:59,877
If you won't do that...

586
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,797
then go on as usual.

587
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:05,927
You're good at that.

588
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,887
Holding out your hand first.

589
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:09,867
Just...

590
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:13,647
go on as you usually do.

591
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,367
The usual?

592
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,437
Wow...

593
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:35,807
I was wondering why she 
kept her sunglasses on.

594
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:37,187
It was all for promotion.

595
00:45:37,187 --> 00:45:40,117
In this clip, those sunglasses are...

596
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:41,737
the most affordable.

597
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:45,097
Who knew those sunglasses
 are from her brand.

598
00:45:45,097 --> 00:45:47,287
She spent 500 million won 
and made 30 billion won.

599
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,837
She'll make more in the future.

600
00:45:48,837 --> 00:45:52,267
After the news, there were more
 than 10 million views in three days.

601
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:55,187
It's been on the search
 list for three days.

602
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:58,507
After all the criticisms, they 
bought those anyway. Aigoo...

603
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,507
She's quite something.

604
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:04,487
With loan sharks after her,

605
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,207
she set up a bigger game.

606
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:16,667
 Thank you. 

607
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:18,807
- Unni, you're so pretty.
- Thank you.

608
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:20,257
What are you doing?

609
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:22,027
Oh, that video.

610
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:25,767
I was in it briefly, and they recognized
 me and wanted a picture.

611
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:27,967
- You seem to be enjoying it.
- No, I'm not.

612
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,767
I'm busy. It's bothersome.

613
00:46:31,337 --> 00:46:33,607
Aigoo, that's the real deal over there.

614
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:34,327
 Unni, me, too. 

615
00:46:34,327 --> 00:46:36,047
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

616
00:46:36,047 --> 00:46:38,627
She became a star due 
to her surprised look.

617
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:39,747
Hello.

618
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:41,267
We're your fans, too.

619
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:44,037
 - We enjoyed the clip.
- Let's take a picture. 

620
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:46,267
 Thank you! 

621
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,387
I'm glad all worked out.

622
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:00,867
You must've been worried.

623
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:03,247
I was worried there 
wouldn't be any articles.

624
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,937
No way...

625
00:47:07,937 --> 00:47:10,077
I only provided the source.

626
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,367
The press released the articles.

627
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,317
You're very gutsy.

628
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:22,307
Do you know why people 
watch controversial dramas?

629
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,517
Because it's provocative.

630
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:28,887
I merely touched on people's...

631
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,247
desire for it.

632
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:33,397
Just like gambling.

633
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:35,867
I guess I have some luck left.

634
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:01,167
Ms. Lee Hyun Ah?

635
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,467
Yes, it's me.

636
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:04,867
How can I help you?

637
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:06,867
You're Ms. Han Sook Ja's 
daughter, correct?

638
00:48:12,637 --> 00:48:14,217
I'm not sure.

639
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:16,307
I can't reach her, either.

640
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:17,847
Then we have no choice.

641
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:20,337
We'll keep visiting you 
until you reach her.

642
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:21,977
Since you're her daughter.

643
00:48:21,977 --> 00:48:24,097
She'll be in touch someday.

644
00:48:24,097 --> 00:48:25,777
We'll see you tomorrow.

645
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:30,027
You know...

646
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:31,797
this is an illegal collection, right?

647
00:48:31,797 --> 00:48:34,707
We're just customers 
at the department store.

648
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,827
Of course, if we continue our visits,

649
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,197
more people will see,

650
00:48:38,197 --> 00:48:40,297
and it'll be uncomfortable for you.

651
00:48:40,297 --> 00:48:42,457
If you're uncomfortable seeing us,

652
00:48:42,457 --> 00:48:44,767
you may pay on her behalf.

653
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,207
If that's won't happen,

654
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:48,747
we have no other choice, either.

655
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:51,927
Well, then. We'll see you next time.

656
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:20,427
 The phone is turned off. 
You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

657
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:22,237
 After the beep, there will 
be a charge for the call. 

658
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,287
 You seriously don't get it. 

659
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,067
 You know the saying. 

660
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:53,667
 "Life or death." 

661
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:56,697
 If you're willing to die, you'll live. 

662
00:49:56,697 --> 00:49:59,767
 If I hadn't put my life on the line, 

663
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,077
 I wouldn't have gotten this far. 

664
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:16,197
Ms. Na.

665
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:20,417
Can I work on the leaflet draft again?

666
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:23,877
Please give me another chance.

667
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:27,897
All right.

668
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:34,597
Thank you.

669
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,167
I know...

670
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,467
you hate me.

671
00:51:24,527 --> 00:51:27,267
On Yoo Ri, perhaps you want to say

672
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:31,367
I'm treating you unfairly 
based on my personal feelings.

673
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:35,067
It's not that I have good 
feelings toward you,

674
00:51:35,087 --> 00:51:38,357
but I'm not an amateur 
bringing that into my work.

675
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,597
No, that's not it.

676
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,657
I'm aware you follow the procedures.

677
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:49,287
So what I'm saying is...

678
00:51:52,207 --> 00:51:56,397
that I know you don't like me.

679
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:01,177
Therefore, now and going forward...

680
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:04,207
you don't want to work with me.

681
00:52:05,557 --> 00:52:07,287
However...

682
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,427
I will be working on this.

683
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:13,857
So you'll have to keep seeing me.

684
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:20,457
My apologies.

685
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:24,307
I know I'm not qualified.

686
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,497
I know I lack in many ways.

687
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:31,347
But...

688
00:52:32,837 --> 00:52:34,847
it's the first chance I'm given.

689
00:52:36,037 --> 00:52:39,387
That's why I want to grab
 this opportunity.

690
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:41,527
Not just you,

691
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:44,227
but others don't like me, either.

692
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,097
I know that.

693
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:48,087
But I...

694
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:52,047
cannot step back.

695
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:55,777
I have nowhere to turn.

696
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,147
I'm sorry.

697
00:53:06,997 --> 00:53:10,187
Even if you button up diligently...

698
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,737
it'll be futile with a wrong start.

699
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:19,107
If I must keep seeing you, so be it.

700
00:53:19,107 --> 00:53:20,357
It's for work.

701
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:21,867
But...

702
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:23,587
aside from work,

703
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:27,027
don't ever come to me with 
personal matters like this.

704
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:29,257
If you're finished, I'll get going.

705
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:33,037
Thank you in advance.

706
00:53:37,307 --> 00:53:39,757
I'll process according 
to the procedure.

707
00:54:07,857 --> 00:54:09,947
Is there room in our 
schedule next week?

708
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:14,987
Yes. It's possible because
 the menswear got delayed.

709
00:54:16,627 --> 00:54:17,637
Leave it open.

710
00:54:17,637 --> 00:54:19,637
Proceed with VIP Team's
 leaflet project.

711
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,947
These are seasonal orders
 from our clients.

712
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:34,567
Check and see if anything is missing.

713
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:37,437
I'll go this way, and you go that way.

714
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:46,837
 Manager Lee! 

715
00:54:46,837 --> 00:54:49,097
 What should we do with
 Hwang In Ok's order? 

716
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:52,447
- Ms. Hwang?
 - Yes. 

717
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:59,447
Since she can't take them 
with her to the afterlife...

718
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:01,157
we should return them, correct?

719
00:55:03,457 --> 00:55:05,727
How much is all this? Aigoo...

720
00:55:07,117 --> 00:55:10,737
Frankly, her family wouldn't
 even know about this.

721
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:13,567
They won't know even
 if we keep them.

722
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:17,507
Leave it. I'll take care of them.

723
00:55:18,787 --> 00:55:19,997
Yes, ma'am.

724
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,567
 

725
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,167
Have a good night.

726
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:45,777
- Thank you.
- Good work.

727
00:55:49,787 --> 00:55:51,077
Aren't you going home?

728
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:54,967
I have some work left.

729
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,207
You go ahead.

730
00:55:56,207 --> 00:55:57,627
Goodnight.

731
00:56:12,277 --> 00:56:13,587
Will you be late?

732
00:56:13,587 --> 00:56:16,387
Yes, I have an executive
 meeting tomorrow morning.

733
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:19,967
I'll wrap up. Let's go home together.

734
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,867
No, finish up.

735
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:23,647
It seems urgent.

736
00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:25,087
I'll go ahead.

737
00:56:38,757 --> 00:56:40,387
Is it not to your liking?

738
00:56:40,387 --> 00:56:42,137
Should I make you a different one?

739
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,847
Maybe because I'm eating alone. 
I don't have much appetite.

740
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:49,917
Can I take it to go?

741
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:07,167
 

742
00:57:33,897 --> 00:57:35,067
Yes, Ahjussi.

743
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:36,657
Per your speculation,

744
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:39,217
the text was sent online, 
not from a phone.

745
00:57:39,217 --> 00:57:42,447
 They changed the number 
as they sent it online. 

746
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:44,117
Where was it sent from?

747
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:47,237
That's the strange part.

748
00:57:49,267 --> 00:57:52,067
Ahjussi, I can't hear well 
because I'm in the elevator.

749
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,367
I'll call you when I get off.

750
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:00,967
 This was... 

751
00:58:00,967 --> 00:58:04,667
 sent from a computer
 in your company. 

752
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,087
- Our company?
 - Yeah. 

753
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:09,667
 So I checked for the user and... 

754
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,037
 Hello? 

755
00:58:25,037 --> 00:58:26,647
 Hello, Jung Sun? 

756
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:28,417
Ahjussi, I'm sorry. I...

757
00:58:28,417 --> 00:58:30,387
- Right now, I'm...
 - No. 

758
00:58:30,387 --> 00:58:33,037
The user of the computer...

759
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:36,717
comes up as Na Jung Sun.

760
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:39,007
What?

761
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,567
♫  I'm wasting my time  ♫

762
00:59:00,567 --> 00:59:03,277
 

763
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:11,567
♫  But now we realize 
what's right, nothing's right  ♫

764
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:19,247
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫

765
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:22,937
♫  Pretend to be fine, but nothing's right  ♫

766
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:27,727
♫  No lie  ♫

767
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,437
 You should just stop 
and open that door. 

768
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:34,217
 If I flirt with you, 
will you fall for me? 

769
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:36,367
 You have to be the
 heroine, don't you? 

770
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,447
 Is it you? 

771
00:59:38,657 --> 00:59:41,517
 If I take the blue pill, I'll remain 
in the world I want to believe. 

772
00:59:41,517 --> 00:59:43,517
 If I take the red pill, I'll know the truth. 

773
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:47,207
 Living without knowing the truth. 
Can you call that real? 

774
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:49,767
 - I thought we'd be a great match.
- I'll give it my all. 

775
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,687
 Jung Sun, it's not what you think. 

776
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:52,957
 What am I thinking of? 

777
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:55,007
 Just what the heck am I thinking?
