1
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,919
I received this text.

2
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,219
 

3
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,649
I wanted to ignore it...

4
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,129
I really did, but...

5
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,669
that made it bigger in my mind.

6
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,089
I have to know.

7
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:05,829
I must know about the woman...

8
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,279
you were involved with.

9
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,619
Who on earth...

10
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,609
I don't know who sent it.

11
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:33,029
They changed the number online.

12
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,689
At my desk at that.

13
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,419
At first, I thought it was a tasteless
 joke and wanted to ignore it.

14
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,459
But I couldn't.

15
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,009
I guess I can't help myself.

16
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,629
I wanted to.

17
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,789
"Everyone can waver 
once in their lifetime."

18
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,259
I pretended to understand.

19
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:05,609
As if my self-esteem 
hadn't hit rock bottom.

20
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:11,289
I pretended to be generous 
enough to embrace everything.

21
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,829
That's what I wanted to do, but...

22
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,329
I think about it every day.

23
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,719
You taking...

24
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,619
that woman's hand in yours.

25
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,959
And touching her face.

26
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,459
Would you have whispered...

27
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,809
"I love you" while doing so?

28
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:48,469
If I think about that, 
I feel like going crazy.

29
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,249
I tell myself I shouldn't, but...

30
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,339
I can't stop my train of thought.

31
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,379
I fall into hell every day...

32
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,359
and wonder how you 
could do this to me, yet...

33
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,839
Do you know what pops
 into my mind?

34
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,359
"Perhaps it's my fault?"

35
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,619
"Did I make him do it?"

36
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,459
"Am I the problem?"

37
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,719
Jung Sun...

38
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,329
I can't continue suffering
 in my delusions.

39
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,109
So I must know.

40
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,709
Whatever it is...

41
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,659
Whatever the aftermath...

42
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,879
I have to know.

43
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,149
Don't pretend you didn't 
tell me for my sake.

44
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:01,779
You're not afraid that I'll get hurt.

45
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:04,459
You're afraid of what you'll lose.

46
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,879
Do you want to protect that woman?

47
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,729
Is this text true?

48
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,859
- No.
- Then why?

49
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,119
Why won't you tell me?

50
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,459
You always keep your mouth
 shut at times like this.

51
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,339
Don't you know how
 that drives me insane?

52
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,889
You were the same back then.

53
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:56,319
I wanted you to scream and
 bite down on me then.

54
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:01,979
That would've made me feel better.

55
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,849
I'll stay at a hotel for now.

56
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,959
Call me when you're ready to talk.

57
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,929
Jung Sun.

58
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:24,089
Don't think you can avoid it.

59
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,029
I have no intention of stepping back.

60
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,559
I'll leave.

61
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:41,789
I'll leave...

62
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,539
You stay here.

63
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:51,719
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

64
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:58,939
♫  Set me free from 
these nightmares  ♫

65
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:04,929
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

66
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:12,209
♫  In my pitiful state, in this season  ♫

67
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,699
♫  Set me free from
 these nightmares  ♫

68
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:27,969
♫  From the memories 
which have faded  ♫

69
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,659
♫  I still hear those 
words in my ears  ♫

70
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:38,089
♫  I try to make them go away  ♫

71
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:44,059
♫  But they're closing in on me  ♫

72
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:47,839
♫  I can't put a stop to it  ♫

73
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,119
♫  Even though I say it 
without making a sound  ♫

74
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:58,639
♫  Will anyone know of 
what's in my heart  ♫

75
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,859
 

76
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,199
It's delicious.

77
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,699
This place will become hot.

78
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,449
I know.

79
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,569
In our field, the experience
 is our asset.

80
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,999
It's best to check out 
the current trends.

81
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,329
Like this.

82
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,519
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,709
These tastes require money. 
No other choice.

84
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,909
Why are you picking at your food?

85
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,599
I don't have much appetite.

86
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,389
With this great food?

87
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,449
Oh, did you hear?

88
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:35,939
Mr. Jung's wife is

89
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,969
suing the company, saying it's illegal
 to dismiss due to infidelity.

90
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,499
Daebak. Really?

91
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:43,159
His wife sure is something else.

92
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,319
At this point, I think 
I understand Mr. Jung.

93
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,829
Living with such a wife can't be easy.

94
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,379
Because he needs to make a living.

95
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,669
Anyway, his wife is a victim, too.

96
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,139
That's true.

97
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,159
Regardless of the reason,
 infidelity isn't justifiable.

98
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,309
Isn't that right?

99
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:10,179
In the end, it destroys a family.

100
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,719
Yes, of course. It's wrong.

101
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,419
Everyone seems to think 
differently these days.

102
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,489
- Well, my take on that...
- Yoo Ri, what do you think?

103
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,839
I think it's wrong.

104
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,569
What on earth?

105
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,419
What's with this mood?

106
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,619
Aigoo, I ran my mouth in 
front of a married woman.

107
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,479
Since I'm divorced, I must be out of it.

108
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,709
Sorry.

109
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,559
Okay, everyone. Let's enjoy 
this delicious food.

110
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,479
That concludes the Myongil Department 
Store's business plan for Tifóne.

111
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,349
We're making an effort to deliver

112
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:16,999
a uniform brand identity 
message worldwide.

113
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,489
With this sizable offer...

114
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,229
I'll take it into consideration.

115
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:25,529
We can always revise according
 to the headquarters' feedback.

116
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:30,589
Sung Un's proposed size 
for the main store

117
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,599
is about 2/3 of Myongil's.

118
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,339
Since Tifóne's brand 
identity concept is

119
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,979
casual high-end jewelry,

120
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,529
we didn't go for a typical jewelry store,

121
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,219
but for a luxury brand shop.

122
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:46,039
Space is small, but the location is 
central and easily accessible.

123
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,249
It's in the midst of the best 
selling luxury brands.

124
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:51,639
It'll implement the image
 of being a "key brand."

125
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,989
Truthfully, this type of shop is
 quite unconventional, even for us.

126
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:05,779
Tifóne's Chairman is 
something, all right.

127
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,549
I don't know what he's thinking.

128
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:12,109
We must complete this phase to
 move onto the next step.

129
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,639
Report back when the results are out.

130
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,599
Yes, sir.

131
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,609
Oh, and also...

132
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:25,209
did you carry about my order?

133
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,779
It'll be taken care of soon.

134
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:31,869
Okay.

135
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,559
What are you thinking so hard about?

136
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,649
This is Park Sung Joon 
from the Management Team.

137
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,709
I'm Leah from Tifóne.

138
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,579
Let's meet up.

139
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,799
He painted destruction...

140
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,829
but it's so beautiful.

141
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,519
The artist seems to know that

142
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,289
rather than not desiring anything,

143
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:09,679
it's more tempting to do so and 
lead the way for destruction.

144
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:17,639
We processed payment for 
your chosen artwork.

145
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,629
We'll deliver to this address.

146
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,949
Thanks to you, I can view this 
artwork from my living room.

147
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,809
The contract...

148
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:38,269
Answer it.

149
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,029
Please excuse me for a moment.

150
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,329
Yes, Chairman.

151
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,969
Pardon?

152
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:55,589
Yes.

153
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,049
I understand.

154
00:12:58,219 --> 00:12:59,519
Thank you.

155
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,819
Is it Daniel?

156
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,399
Yes.

157
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,569
He decided on Sung Un?

158
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:23,139
Yes.

159
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:26,179
Congratulations.

160
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,709
I'll consider this as a gift then.

161
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,849
It's bribe money anyway.

162
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:34,939
Don't feel so wronged.

163
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,149
Myongil paid me, too.

164
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,849
I'm no longer associated 
with Tifóne now.

165
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,969
If they find out you lobbied me,

166
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:46,479
they'll cancel your agreement.

167
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,829
It's best to keep it quiet, correct?

168
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,379
I understand you were with 
Chairman Daniel for a long time.

169
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,649
All relationships must 
come to an end.

170
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,529
Since we're parting ways,

171
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,889
I can't walk away
 empty-handed alone.

172
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,879
You have no remorse...

173
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,069
toward the chairman?

174
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:12,329
You're here to pay me off, 
yet you're being a nice guy.

175
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,709
How funny.

176
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,329
Rather than a bad girl,

177
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,619
isn't it easier to curse at an evil b****?

178
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,409
To the airport, please.

179
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,969
 You know what? 

180
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,769
I was nothing...

181
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,779
but you told me I shine 
like the jewels.

182
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,349
That's why I made it this far.

183
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,139
I already knew.

184
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,419
That you...

185
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:05,559
don't love me anymore...

186
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,719
It was obvious to me.

187
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,869
But it was okay.

188
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,819
Because I love you.

189
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:20,349
It was okay, but...

190
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,879
I can't destroy Tifóne because 
of my personal feelings.

191
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,969
Many board members are
 already on my side.

192
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,489
You can't defeat me.

193
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,869
No.

194
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,379
I'm much stronger than you think.

195
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,209
To protect what's precious to me...

196
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,799
I'll become stronger.

197
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,439
 

198
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,099
Leah.

199
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:29,539
You're fired.

200
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:50,069
 

201
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,679
- The executives will join you.
- Okay.

202
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:26,919
What a shame.

203
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,359
If I had time, I'd like to 
stay another day.

204
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:33,619
I'm glad your stay in Korea
 was a pleasant one.

205
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,489
It's a wedding band.

206
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,389
She's in your department, right?

207
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,969
Yes.

208
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,679
How did you...

209
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,829
Thank you.

210
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,279
Have a safe trip back.

211
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,589
Long time no see.

212
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,789
Have you been well?

213
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,799
 

214
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,359
Vice President...

215
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,759
wants to end things.

216
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,839
Does he have another woman?

217
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,249
If I don't want to end things...

218
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:12,839
what will happen?

219
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,769
People at work think...

220
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:18,159
you're in an ordinary dating
 relationship, correct?

221
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,199
If they find out it's infidelity...

222
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,949
everyone will be shocked.

223
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,339
I don't care.

224
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:47,109
Wouldn't it be best if your 
parents don't find out?

225
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:52,679
 

226
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,269
It's a confidentiality agreement 
stating you won't talk about...

227
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,329
your relationship to other people.

228
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,229
It'll be in your best interest...

229
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,939
to end it here as well, Soo Jin.

230
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:10,219
 

231
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,099
Good job.

232
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,359
Since you finished a big task, you just 
have to climb up the ladder.

233
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:18,289
We should really get 
down to business, huh?

234
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,149
Yes, sir.

235
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,949
 

236
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,989
- Take that!
- Bang! Gotcha!

237
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:41,289
If you don't shoot, I will.

238
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,189
Get away!

239
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,589
What? Still?

240
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,509
Never mind.

241
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:58,989
What was that?

242
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,869
Your reaction really bugs.

243
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:02,459
I mean, something's off.

244
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:05,829
Being away for so long. 
Unless there's something else.

245
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:07,049
Something else?

246
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,449
- Well, like another man...
- You crazy bastard!

247
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,429
I'm just saying.

248
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:14,219
What must you think of Mi Na?

249
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,799
Watch it.

250
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,459
But Byung Hoon.

251
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:22,869
Don't rest so easy regardless.

252
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,229
You don't even know 
where your wife is.

253
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,189
Aren't you trusting too much?

254
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,249
At this rate, you'll end up like me.

255
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,209
You just never know with people.

256
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,809
I'm sorry!

257
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,899
Share with Seo Joon.

258
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:29,429
Did you feed Young Joon 
and Seo Joon?

259
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:30,369
 Yeah. 

260
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,669
 Where are you? 

261
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,559
I came outside real quick.

262
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,259
 - Real quick where? 
- What do you mean, where?

263
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,519
Where are you?

264
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,309
What's the matter all of 
a sudden? An interrogation?

265
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,829
Should we go where you are today?

266
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:46,879
Huh?

267
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:50,269
I mean, I should know 
where you live, at least.

268
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:52,929
What if you collapse 
somewhere and die alone?

269
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:54,149
I told them I got transferred away.

270
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:57,589
If we meet in the middle of Seoul, 
the kids will understand, huh?

271
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:00,279
- Then just me...
 - Ms. Song Mi Na. 

272
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,719
I have to go. I'll talk to you later.

273
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:15,189
Did you make your decision?

274
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,119
Yes.

275
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,699
What about your husband?

276
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:24,149
I'm not with the baby's father.

277
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:29,569
The earliest date would be the best.

278
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,639
Okay.

279
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:36,779
They'll schedule your surgery outside.

280
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:39,889
Okay.

281
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:58,129
Ahjussi, how much longer?

282
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:59,329
We're almost there.

283
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,449
Right here.

284
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,899
 

285
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:14,209
No way.

286
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,109
Not this attic room, right?

287
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,719
This attic room is nice.

288
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:20,399
With that amount of money, 
this place is hard to come by.

289
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,269
I'm from the real estate office.

290
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:25,739
We're here to see the room.

291
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,919
- Hello.
- Hi.

292
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,899
It's a good location.

293
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:52,169
It's up for rent because she's 
moving to a nice apartment.

294
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,839
You can't find a better deal.

295
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,789
I see. Okay.

296
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,059
I guess you're moving?

297
00:27:12,459 --> 00:27:13,699
Yes.

298
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,279
What do you think? It's nice, right?

299
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:20,849
I'll keep looking.

300
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:22,519
All righty, then.

301
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,179
Have a good day.

302
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,101
 

303
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:02,001
 

304
00:28:02,271 --> 00:28:05,101
This is the VIP invitation
 list for Tifóne exhibit.

305
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,351
Matching names with faces is a given.

306
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:08,811
Their families and other notable details.

307
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:11,681
You must memorize 
everything that's on here.

308
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,501
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:16,201
You know the vendor 
meetings start today, right?

310
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,781
Mi Na and Sang Woo, 
you come with me.

311
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,961
- Yoo Ri, you go with Manager Lee.
- Yes, ma'am.

312
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:25,141
We're entering the war zone now.

313
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:28,911
Hello.

314
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:31,091
Hello, hello. Hi, hi.

315
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,261
How's everyone?

316
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:33,161
Hello.

317
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,871
Mr. Cha, what brings you by?

318
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,411
The Tifóne exhibit will be under 
this month's special section.

319
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:41,711
Team Leader gave the 
order to stay on top of

320
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:43,711
all preparations and processes.

321
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:47,181
Even if I bother you starting today,

322
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:49,861
thank you in advance for
 your understanding.

323
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,901
I'm just trying to make a living here.

324
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:54,361
Yoo Ri.

325
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:03,981
Thank you for your cooperation.

326
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,571
You'll need to stay alert.

327
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,881
Because the hyenas will pounce.

328
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,461
I'm Director Lee Byun Hoon
 from Dongil.

329
00:29:24,711 --> 00:29:26,781
I'm General Manager 
Park Chae Hwan from Ilhoon.

330
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,371
I'm Song Il Young from Aeri.

331
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,261
I'm Kim Tae Woo from Gardeno.

332
00:29:35,871 --> 00:29:37,271
As you know,

333
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:39,821
we'll decide on the valet 
vendors for this event

334
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,871
based on today's presentations.

335
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,761
Let's start the presentations.

336
00:29:43,761 --> 00:29:45,431
We'll start with Dongil.

337
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:48,011
The rest of you wait in the next room.

338
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,401
Get your glare on.

339
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,461
You're the judging panel
 today, Yoo Ri.

340
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:04,031
Department stores need 
innovation now.

341
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,841
We need young blood
 like Team Leader Park

342
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:09,011
to go up against the changing trends.

343
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,051
This type of promotion

344
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:14,741
could discourage employees who 
are climbing up the ladder slowly.

345
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,231
An organization is an organism.

346
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,571
An organization must 
change and adapt.

347
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:21,711
We've seen the results 
of his performance,

348
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:23,941
and I don't feel this is unreasonable.

349
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:28,021
Well, regarding this issue...

350
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:31,481
Let's discuss this again 
at our next meeting.

351
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:37,991
For those employed at an organization,

352
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:40,261
promotions are everything.

353
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:42,351
Something to consider carefully.

354
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:44,951
Right? That's what I'm saying, Father.

355
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,151
But Father.

356
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:49,211
- In this day and age...
- If we cater to every new era,

357
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:51,471
we'll lose our way more.

358
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:55,421
Every organization has its 
own culture for a reason.

359
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,401
I'll keep observing for now.

360
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,921
If he seems befitting,

361
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:04,291
I'll promote him myself 
without your urging.

362
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,181
Yes, sir.

363
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,021
Great job, Managing Director.

364
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,061
Thanks.

365
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,841
That old man...

366
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,571
He's still so old-fashioned.

367
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,581
Hit the Tifóne project out of the park.

368
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,221
We'll have to show them 
with the numbers.

369
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:57,301
 
 I received this text. 

370
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,601
 This is Kim Dong Ho from
 the IT Department. 

371
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:13,351
This is Park Sung Joon 
from the Management Team.

372
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:15,611
Oh, Team Leader Park. 
What's going on?

373
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,591
I have a favor to ask.

374
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,281
Of course, I'll take care of your 
request, Team Leader Park.

375
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:23,691
On October 7th, after 8 p.m.

376
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,371
Is there a way to get the 
entrance and exit records?

377
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,471
- Entrance and exit records?
- Yes.

378
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:33,601
Things like this usually
 require approval.

379
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:35,471
That's why I put in a call separately.

380
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:39,031
I'm not able to give you the details,

381
00:32:39,031 --> 00:32:40,701
but it's a work-related matter.

382
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,841
Is that right? I guess I can 
help out with that.

383
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,451
Thank you.

384
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,851
- Assistant Manager Lee.
- Yes?

385
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:03,471
 

386
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,451
Pull this up and give it to Team Leader 
Park of the Management Team.

387
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,481
Don't use the company 
email or the messenger.

388
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:10,771
Give him the printouts.

389
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,141
Yes, sir.

390
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:27,491
We'd like five varieties of main 
dishes to give them options.

391
00:33:27,491 --> 00:33:29,461
More importantly,

392
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:32,101
could we please have Chef Mikhail

393
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:34,211
be the main chef for our catering?

394
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:36,471
We have many important 
attendees this time.

395
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:41,061
As you know, Chef Mikhail 
picks and chooses his events.

396
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,271
I'll set up a meeting for now.

397
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,121
Okay. Thank you.

398
00:33:45,121 --> 00:33:47,921
We've also selected 
some wines for pairing.

399
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,291
Please sample them.

400
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:08,421
Yes?

401
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:12,021
Ms. Na, what should I do?

402
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:15,201
I think I'm in trouble.

403
00:34:15,241 --> 00:34:16,401
What?

404
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:20,791
I'll be right there. Trace your 
whereabouts today from the start.

405
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,071
Mi Na, I have to go back first.

406
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:27,511
Take charge of 
contacting Chef Mikhail.

407
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:28,891
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:43,441
We'll review the contents 
and let you know soon.

409
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,621
Thanks for your hard work.

410
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:48,351
 Thank you. 

411
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,601
How does it feel to hold the cards?

412
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,011
Pardon?

413
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,591
We're the lowly ones 
before the VIPs,

414
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:01,401
but we hold the cards 
with the vendors.

415
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,111
Life is funny, isn't it?

416
00:35:03,111 --> 00:35:06,441
Be lowly here, and be 
of high position there.

417
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,521
What goes around, comes around.

418
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,211
It's not bad to enjoy it to a degree,

419
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,621
but don't get too immersed.

420
00:35:14,731 --> 00:35:16,211
In life...

421
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,221
nothing is for free.

422
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,201
You don't have it?

423
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,031
Sang Woo, you know, right?

424
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:34,381
If we lose the original document, we have 
to get the President's signature again.

425
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,361
Yes.

426
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:39,541
Forget our side for a second.

427
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,971
Tifóne is a different story.

428
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,491
We must find it.

429
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:45,711
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:49,031
After you received the document from 
the Business Strategy Department,

431
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:51,331
did you put it down anywhere at all?

432
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:52,811
Well...

433
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:58,431
I saw Assistant Manager Lee from the 
Product Department in the elevator.

434
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:02,081
His box looked so heavy, and I offered to hold it.

435
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:03,851
Perhaps...

436
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:05,811
did I put it on top of the box?

437
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,851
No, thank you.

438
00:36:08,851 --> 00:36:11,011
You want me to fuss 
over the rich folks.

439
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:12,381
I'm not interested in that.

440
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,441
- That's not it...
- I'm busy. Excuse me.

441
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,631
My apologies.

442
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:22,491
We can't do anything 
about the chef's decision.

443
00:36:28,071 --> 00:36:30,181
I'm back.

444
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,861
What about Chef Mikhail? 
Did he say okay?

445
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:37,361
Man, I've heard he's difficult.

446
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,831
Was Chef Mikhail the 
top preferred choice?

447
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,191
Yes. He's the hottest chef 
with the VIPs right now.

448
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:47,571
Everyone jokes that even the president 
has to wait a month to dine at his place.

449
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,631
Truthfully, he's one of a kind.

450
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:54,501
I'll try convincing him more.

451
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,331
You can entrust me.

452
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:00,071
Okay then.

453
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,301
 

454
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:25,101
I'm not here for you. 
I'm here for the Team Leader.

455
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:31,911
- Hello.
- Hi.

456
00:37:31,911 --> 00:37:35,221
My team leader asked me 
to give this to you.

457
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:36,671
Thank you, Mr. Lee.

458
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,011
Of course. Have a good day.

459
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:06,621
On Yoo Ri from the VIP 
Management Team speaking.

460
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:07,541
 Hello. 

461
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:10,241
 This is Kim Tae Woo from 
Gardeno. We met today. 

462
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,711
Oh...

463
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,461
Yes, Mr. Kim.

464
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:18,761
Why ask for me...

465
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:23,461
I think that will be difficult.

466
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,771
Yes. My apologies.

467
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:51,481
I got off the elevator with it.

468
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:55,331
Anyway, we narrowed
 down the places.

469
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,461
Ask everyone on the 
ninth floor if you have to.

470
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,301
Go scavenge the place.

471
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:00,821
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,461
By chance...

473
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:14,851
could we check the footage
 for October 7th as well?

474
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:16,221
After 8 p.m.

475
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,691
October 7th?

476
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,551
Yes. It's a work-related matter.

477
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:26,831
Your team leader already 
took that day's footage.

478
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,031
Pardon?

479
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:29,941
The VIP Management Team, correct?

480
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:30,791
Yes.

481
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,611
Team Leader Park Sung Joon 
took it earlier.

482
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:37,951
All right. I got it.

483
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:57,261
Ms. Na, I found it.

484
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,261
I put it deep in my desk 
drawer for safekeeping,

485
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:03,441
but it fell behind the drawer.

486
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:06,481
That's good. What a relief.

487
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,461
Take the document to Team Leader.

488
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:09,641
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,081
I'm not sure it'll be to your liking.

490
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:46,731
Do you like wine?

491
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,341
- Yes, well...
- That's good.

492
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,391
The reason I'm here...

493
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:59,431
is to set something straight.

494
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:03,561
I think there's been
 a misunderstanding.

495
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:07,111
Even if you do this, there's 
nothing I can do for you.

496
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:09,411
We lost out on the bidding.

497
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:12,221
Manager Lee notified us today.

498
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,571
So no need to worry

499
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,611
if this is soliciting or not.

500
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,181
Then why...

501
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:24,041
I want to maintain a good 
relationship with you, Yoo Ri.

502
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,381
We may have lost out this time,

503
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:28,051
but there will be other chances.

504
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,251
And...

505
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:32,141
you may hold the deciding vote then.

506
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:34,301
It's a long-term investment.

507
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,591
So don't feel burdened today.

508
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:42,151
Think of it as having a casual drink

509
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,761
in a comfortable setting.

510
00:41:59,741 --> 00:42:01,971
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

511
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,551
Talking with you makes
 the time fly by, Yoo Ri.

512
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:14,871
I think we understand each other.

513
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,641
Wouldn't you want to work with
 a company that you relate to?

514
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:21,061
No one's signed a contract yet.

515
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:24,161
Why don't you bring it up
 to Ms. Lee again?

516
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:26,891
You should state your 
opinions at times like this

517
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:29,081
to solidify your position 
at the company.

518
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,761
I told you from the get-go.

519
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:42,291
If I thought this was a 
solicitation, I wouldn't be here.

520
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,931
I mean, I was just 
making conversation.

521
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:49,231
Something like that.

522
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:56,831
You said you wanted to maintain 
a good relationship with me.

523
00:42:58,831 --> 00:43:01,231
If that's the case, I think you failed.

524
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,401
I must've seemed easy as if...

525
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,601
I'd fall over a glass of wine.

526
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,331
I mean...

527
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,011
That's not it, but...

528
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:16,741
Well...

529
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:22,691
If we do well, of course, we 
wouldn't look the other way.

530
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:25,361
You're...

531
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,111
in the wrong again.

532
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:42,461
For today, let's say we 
had a nice drink.

533
00:43:42,461 --> 00:43:45,531
Any more would be upsetting.

534
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:47,821
Well, then.

535
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,081
Wait...

536
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,051
Yoo Ri.

537
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,741
 You may hold the deciding vote then. 

538
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:17,001
 It's a long-term investment. 

539
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:54,421
 

540
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:22,551
Jung Sun...

541
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:26,161
has been hurt enough.

542
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,891
If she finds out it's you,

543
00:45:29,891 --> 00:45:31,171
then...

544
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:36,591
the scar will last a lifetime.

545
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:40,341
I can't let that happen.

546
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:45,631
It's...

547
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,401
over for me.

548
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:54,371
I won't be going back.

549
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:56,141
So...

550
00:45:58,281 --> 00:45:59,851
you end it, too.

551
00:46:01,811 --> 00:46:03,391
I ask of you.

552
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:35,941
 

553
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:45,151
I'll be back.

554
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:12,551
Be my friend today.

555
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:18,751
 

556
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:23,251
It was sent from your desk?

557
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:29,561
And you don't know who it is?

558
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:30,921
No.

559
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:35,541
But I think Oppa looked into it.

560
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:41,451
He took the security cam
 footage from that day.

561
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,221
Since the rumor could spread at work,

562
00:48:47,221 --> 00:48:49,291
I'm sure...

563
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:51,641
he wanted to see who it was.

564
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:56,791
Yet, would he do so if
 this text is not true?

565
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,481
Do you really want to know?

566
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:04,961
If you're going to stay with him,

567
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:06,881
you're better off not knowing.

568
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,291
Whatever it is.

569
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,191
I thought so, too.

570
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,361
But I must know...

571
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:21,571
what it is to see if I can...

572
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:23,411
forgive him or not.

573
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:28,961
I can't live my life in fear of the truth.

574
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:34,641
Are you sure you won't...

575
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:37,001
regret it?

576
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:53,031
Then you should look into it.

577
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,711
If you'll continue being 
suspicious, won't it be better to

578
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:59,581
check regardless of the method?

579
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:02,431
If you...

580
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,331
insist on knowing.

581
00:50:25,701 --> 00:50:27,001
Chef.

582
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,931
I only have five minutes 
due to lunch preparations.

583
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:37,411
Okay.

584
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:46,021
Ms. Jung Soon Ok lost her husband 
a year ago and couldn't eat.

585
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:48,741
She said your food gave 
her back her strength.

586
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:54,731
When Ms. Lee Na Yong had anorexia, 
she was introduced to your cooking.

587
00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:57,491
She started eating again,
 little-by-little.

588
00:50:57,491 --> 00:50:59,171
What are you doing?

589
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:03,191
I wanted to say this isn't just about
 fussing over the rich folks.

590
00:51:03,191 --> 00:51:05,111
All these people

591
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:08,031
purely like your cooking, Chef Mikhail.

592
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:11,501
We're seeking you out 
because of these customers.

593
00:51:13,081 --> 00:51:15,901
Could you please reconsider?

594
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:17,701
Why go through these measures?

595
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:23,691
This project is important to me.

596
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:29,241
My promotion depends 
on this project.

597
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:32,451
Therefore, it must go well.

598
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:34,951
And for it to go well...

599
00:51:34,951 --> 00:51:37,631
the customers must be satisfied.

600
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:45,211
If it's for 100 people,

601
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:48,721
it'll be hard to give more than three
 main dishes. Will it be okay?

602
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:53,221
Yes.

603
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:55,291
It's completely doable.

604
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,951
I'll plan the courses. 
Leave your business card.

605
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:01,121
Thank you.

606
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,141
I'm saying this so you 
won't misunderstand.

607
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:06,111
I'm not doing this because 
of your fake sob stories.

608
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,421
It's because you seem so desperate.

609
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:12,911
And also...

610
00:52:12,911 --> 00:52:15,001
I'm reminded of the past.

611
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:20,571
It's not like me to get so emotional.

612
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:25,141
Well, it's not like I'm doing 
this for free. And...

613
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,861
"Customer satisfaction
 is mine as well."

614
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,161
If you would've said that, 
I would've said no.

615
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:30,731
But since it's for your own sake...

616
00:52:32,071 --> 00:52:33,421
I like your honesty.

617
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:35,741
Thank you.

618
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:38,591
I have lunch preparations.

619
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:39,501
Yes.

620
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,001
Ms. Lee.

621
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,301
We got Chef Mikhail on board.

622
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,601
- He'll do it?
- Yes.

623
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:13,101
You managed to convince him.

624
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:17,261
Report this to Team Leader yourself.

625
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:20,771
You pulled off a big task. 
You should show off.

626
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:22,721
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:25,001
Great job.

628
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,311
You did well, Mi Na.

629
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,431
Yes.

630
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:37,481
 

631
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,361
 Let's talk after work tonight. 

632
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:58,491
How much longer should I wait?

633
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,501
You said before...

634
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:10,841
that I should cling onto you once.

635
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,311
Jung Sun, could you do it this time?

636
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,571
I keep thinking this these days.

637
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:32,971
Since we pretended 
all was okay then,

638
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:35,731
it ended up festering
 and exploding.

639
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:39,981
I don't want to repeat 
the same mistake.

640
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:44,791
That way, we won't let 
go of each other.

641
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:08,921
Is something wrong at home?

642
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:12,321
Are you even curious?

643
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:16,861
Fine.

644
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:20,171
Honestly, it was 
understandable at first.

645
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:22,431
You worked so hard by yourself.

646
00:55:22,431 --> 00:55:23,871
You had a hard time.

647
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,201
You have ambition and 
passion for your work.

648
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:31,341
Your promotion got delayed due to
 motherhood. You must've been upset.

649
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,561
That's why...

650
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:35,691
it was understandable.

651
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:38,341
But I'll be making an effort now.

652
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,071
I've come to my senses.

653
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:44,281
Yet you're still not coming back.

654
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:47,501
I don't know what this is anymore.

655
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,911
Dong Chan thinks...

656
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,001
you might have a man, Mi Na.

657
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:01,981
I know it's nonsense.

658
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:06,561
But then, I wonder if
 it really is nonsense.

659
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:10,421
The current situation 
doesn't make sense either.

660
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:13,721
These days, I really...

661
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:17,121
don't know what is what.

662
00:56:22,091 --> 00:56:23,401
I'm sorry.

663
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:26,901
Just a little longer...

664
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:32,331
Please wait just a little longer.

665
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:51,011
 

666
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:52,521
 

667
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,861
 

668
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,041
 

669
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,181
 

670
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:06,011
 

671
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:09,721
 

672
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:17,221
 

673
00:57:17,221 --> 00:57:19,401
 

674
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,261
 

675
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:35,921
 

676
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,281
 

677
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:27,851
 

678
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:31,761
♫  Seizing for the truth  ♫

679
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:38,421
♫  But now we realize 
what's right, nothing's right  ♫

680
00:59:38,421 --> 00:59:46,171
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫

681
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:50,011
♫  Pretend to be fine, 
but nothing's right  ♫

682
00:59:50,011 --> 00:59:54,901
♫  No lie  ♫

683
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:56,561
 You should grab her by the hair. 

684
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:57,881
 That seems more human. 

685
00:59:57,881 --> 00:59:59,891
 - Any plans for Seo Joon's younger sibling?
- Not at all. 

686
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:01,061
 Aigoo, that would be crazy. 

687
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:03,741
 Hanjung Group's Chairwoman Lee will 
participate anonymously in the auction? 

688
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,681
 We're not just acquaintances here. 

689
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:06,931
 I guess your company doesn't know. 

690
01:00:06,931 --> 01:00:09,491
 Be careful and make sure my 
wife doesn't see that girl. 

691
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:12,221
 I'd know only if you tell me. 

692
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,891
 I'll go. Let's talk it out tonight. 

693
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:18,591
♫  Pretend to be fine, 
but nothing's right  ♫

694
01:00:18,591 --> 01:00:22,161
♫  No lie  ♫
