1
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,280
 

2
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,990
This is Na Jung Sun. 
She's joining our team today.

3
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,500
You can all start getting acquainted.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,830
Assistant Manager Park, have her 
take over Seo Hee's tasks.

5
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,790
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,730
Happy to make your acquaintance.

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,710
 Perhaps... 

8
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,230
 it was from the time we first met. 

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,420
 He was diligent, 

10
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,370
 well-mannered, 

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,900
When I started working, 
I lost my appetite.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,170
 and a man of few words. 

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,970
How could you do this?

14
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,110
Shouldn't you have
 paid more attention?

15
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,690
Many people were affected 
because of you, Min Woo.

16
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,820
 He wasn't the friendly type, but... 

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,390
Thank you.

18
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,360
 he had a warm heart. 

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,070
Jung Sun, your job is

20
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,850
to discuss with the 
PR Team and proceed...

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,160
Aren't you writing this down?

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,180
I won't repeat myself.

23
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,390
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,500
I'll work with the PR Team
 to assist the event.

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,820
I've done similar work on my
 former team. I know the process.

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,280
I'll check for anything unusual 
from the pre-existing format.

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,820
Mr. Park, does your girlfriend
 like these events, too?

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,850
Why do you ask?

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,940
The target audience is women.

30
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,740
It would be good to 
hear a general opinion.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,290
I guess you don't have one.

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,800
 I... 

33
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,020
 liked him. 

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,800
This is an unacceptable mistake.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,130
How can you mess up
 the date of all things?

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,130
We issued 10,000 prints 
of the first edition.

37
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,520
What will you do?

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,650
Will you take responsibility for the 
cost of printing 10,000, Na Jung Sun?

39
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,340
My apologies.

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,690
We'll revise the dates 
with stickers today.

41
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,890
You can't even deliver on this?

42
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,080
And this is your first assignment.

43
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,490
How can I entrust you 
with other tasks?

44
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,770
I apologize.

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
If there's even one copy with an error
 and a customer files a claim...

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,800
it'll be on you.

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,650
You may leave.

48
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,210
But you know...

49
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,250
Seo Hee received the proposal 
and Team Leader approved.

50
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,240
Didn't Jung Sun sunbae only 
take it to the printer?

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,630
Jung Sun got the short 
end of the stick.

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,950
He lounges at the sauna all day

53
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,960
and comes in to sign off the invoices.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,830
Of course, he's clueless 
what's going on.

55
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,050
I know.

56
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,660
Poor Jung Sun sunbae got shafted.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,080
Didn't you go home 
after working off-site?

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, well...

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,220
I left some documents here.

60
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,920
You've been working away
 this whole time?

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,280
I have about 1,000 copies left.

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,160
I'll probably finish before 1 a.m.

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,470
You did all this by yourself?

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,710
Everyone was helping. 
They just left.

65
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,850
I can do this amount alone.

66
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,430
I can't have everyone 
become like zombies.

67
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,000
So...

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,290
these revised stickers...

69
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,060
I should put them here, right?

70
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,860
It's all right.

71
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,780
You have an early morning 
meeting tomorrow.

72
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,670
With a helping hand,
 you can finish by midnight.

73
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,500
In that case...

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,070
I won't turn you down.

75
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't you feel wronged?

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,130
This isn't your fault, Jung Sun.

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
I do feel wronged.

78
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,070
I felt so wronged earlier,
 I almost teared up.

79
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,520
You should've said something.

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,550
Gosh, even if I explained myself,

81
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,410
he'd say women don't take 
responsibility for their work,

82
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,590
and always make excuses.

83
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,450
I've heard Team Leader Kim doesn't
 care for female employees.

84
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,150
Regardless of the process,

85
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm in charge of this now.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,000
So I should take responsibility.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,200
We can figure out who is at fault 
when everything has been resolved.

88
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,210
I'm kind of cool, huh?

89
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,440
Let's hurry and finish this up.

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
I think you've fallen for me.

91
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,470
Right?

92
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,280
Let's just do this.

93
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,670
 I found out later on... 

94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
 that when he tells a lie, 

95
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,170
 he avoids eye contact. 

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,250
 

97
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,000
 

98
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,040
 

99
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,610
Hello?

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,750
 Honey, where are you? 

101
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,010
Vice President had
 too much to drink.

102
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,850
I'm leaving soon.

103
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,340
 So you're still with
 the Vice President? 

104
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,070
Yeah.

105
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,520
Well...

106
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,130
things are under control now.

107
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,650
You must be tired. 
Go ahead and sleep.

108
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,970
Please explain...

109
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,720
this situation to me.

110
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,910
Is it really another woman?

111
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,360
If you say no, I'll believe you.

112
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,040
- Jung Sun...
- I'll believe you. Just say no.

113
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,940
It's over.

114
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,580
Jung Sun...

115
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,790
I have to go home.

116
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,440
Jung Sun.

117
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,920
I said I'm going home.

118
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,910
 Jung Sun. 

119
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,860
 Jung Sun, let's talk. 

120
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,680
 Jung Sun! 

121
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,340
 Open the door. 

122
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,480
 Jung Sun. 

123
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,860
 Let's talk for a minute. 

124
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,360
♫  Through the whole night  ♫

125
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,580
♫  Right after a while  ♫

126
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:33,350
♫  I realized that all of mine
 is not here anymore  ♫

127
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,840
♫  Now that I can't deny
 that I fallout, no  ♫

128
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,340
♫  I'm wasting my time  ♫

129
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,710
 Slow down. 

130
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,030
♫  But now we realize what's right  ♫

131
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,600
♫  Nothing's right  ♫

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,700
♫  I'm chasing all the lies 
and all the truth  ♫

133
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,800
 Na Jung Sun, slow down! 

134
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,570
♫  But nothing's right, no lie  ♫

135
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,250
Are you crazy?

136
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,520
If you have a death wish, 
go somewhere else.

137
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,510
Not when I'm present.

138
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,040
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

139
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,810
Are you okay?

140
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,750
Yes.

141
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,630
You should call it a day.

142
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,390
I'm all right.

143
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,010
You shouldn't ride 
when you're agitated.

144
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,080
Go home.

145
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
I don't want to.

146
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,800
Why do all my loved ones...

147
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,060
end up leaving me?

148
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,340
I trusted he wouldn't leave me...

149
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,900
You're a fool.

150
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,930
You actually trusted
 another human being?

151
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,970
You're better off trusting 
those little seagulls.

152
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,000
I know.

153
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,520
Why did I do that?

154
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,940
- To Dad...
- I won't tell him.

155
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,320
Man, that punk, seriously.

156
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,840
Hey, it's okay.

157
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,870
You won't die over this.

158
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,550
You think?

159
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,490
Just the thought of him 
with another woman...

160
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,570
I feel suffocated and 
drives me crazy.

161
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,880
I shouldn't have seen it.

162
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,620
I shouldn't have followed him.

163
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,660
Things have...

164
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,480
a way of exploding to 
surface anyway.

165
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,100
I'm scared...

166
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,500
of losing him.

167
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,760
What should I do, Ahjussi?

168
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,060
What should I do...

169
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,060
I don't know what to say right now.

170
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,250
Jung Sun...

171
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,020
Stay in the study for now.

172
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,100
Don't let it on at work.

173
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,980
 I used to think this way once. 

174
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,470
 That my love was special. 

175
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,300
 Enough to fill in the 
shattered cracks... 

176
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,470
 That my love was special... 

177
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,160
 I did not know 

178
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,710
 that once it starts to 
crack, it'll lead to... 

179
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,300
 a bigger dissonance. 

180
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,690
Good morning.

181
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,140
- Good morning.
- Hello.

182
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,470
Hello.

183
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,080
Are you not feeling well?

184
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,270
I didn't sleep too well.

185
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,470
Did everyone get home okay
 after the team dinner?

186
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,540
It's a good thing I opted out.

187
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,890
People who went to the third 
round drank until 2 a.m.

188
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,090
It was raining, too. 
You're all something.

189
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,260
Rain?

190
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,640
Manager Lee, your place
 is near mine.

191
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,050
It didn't rain there.

192
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,620
Mi Na sunbae, did you 
move by the way?

193
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
No.

194
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,640
I was in the taxi behind you,

195
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,550
but you went the opposite way.

196
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,830
I thought you moved.

197
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,750
I left something at the
 restaurant, so I went back.

198
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,200
What did you leave behind?

199
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,380
Pardon?

200
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,090
It was late and all.

201
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,680
Why not call the restaurant 
and ask them to keep it?

202
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,230
Because it was my cellphone.

203
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,040
Yes.

204
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,510
We had a team dinner
 there last week.

205
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes, Sung Un Department Store.

206
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,430
By chance, did anyone
 leave their cellphone?

207
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,850
There wasn't?

208
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,690
Then how about...

209
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,200
anyone coming to look
 for their phone?

210
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,800
There wasn't?

211
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,880
I see, okay.

212
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,270
To W Hotel, please.

213
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,910
Talk about a headache of a project.

214
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,300
 

215
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,040
Cha Se Rin.

216
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,280
She's a Black Diamond
 Member, the highest

217
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,160
VIP level at our department store.

218
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,530
She spent about 1 billion won
 the previous year.

219
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,090
Of the Black Diamond Members,

220
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,370
she's in the top 10% percentile.

221
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,580
Cha Se Rin is a YouTube star,

222
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,400
and her contents are 
mainly luxury brand "haul."

223
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,590
With over two million followers,

224
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,900
she's the hottest fashion creator
 in South Korea right now.

225
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,480
Her last month's D'amour "haul" clip

226
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,210
reached three million views
 in less than a week.

227
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,700
 Hello, this is Se Rin. 

228
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,250
 You've all been anticipating
 so long for this day. 

229
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,540
 Yes, correct. 

230
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,690
 A 15 million won 
D'amour shopping spree! 

231
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,470
She's also the CEO of 
a well-known shopping mall.

232
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,670
She started a small 
shopping mall in high school

233
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,190
due to family hardships.

234
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,470
It now reports an annual sales
 volume of 100 billion won.

235
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,090
The success story of
 a 28-year-old high school grad.

236
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,010
That is riling up people's 
curiosity more.

237
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,790
Okay, the problem here is...

238
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,430
Cha Se Rin...

239
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,720
requested to air a trunk 
show via YouTube.

240
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
But trunk shows are confidential 
and not open to the public.

241
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,820
However, if this does air,

242
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,590
the marketing impact for our 
target audience will be enormous.

243
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,400
What are her terms?

244
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,290
Everything.

245
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,480
She wants full editing rights as well.

246
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,510
The department store 
will select the items.

247
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,950
But the reviews for those items

248
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,920
will be conducted by her
 in an honest fashion.

249
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,010
If the items receive bad reviews,

250
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,750
there's a possibility we'll 
suffer the negative backlash.

251
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,180
As special as this clip would be,

252
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,290
she has expressed a desire
 to increase sales.

253
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,230
The expected sales volume

254
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,900
- is 500 million won.
- 500 million won?

255
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,400
We should consider 
moving forward with this.

256
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,500
A Black Diamond Member
 is probably also

257
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,010
a high-level VIP at other 
department stores.

258
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,880
Even if we don't do it, 
someone else will.

259
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,120
Exactly.

260
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,820
First, discuss with 
General Manager Kang,

261
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,480
and have Ms. Na and 
Ms. Lee organize the details.

262
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,500
We'll submit the report 
to the Vice President.

263
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,820
Yes, sir.

264
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,860
Yes, sir.

265
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,760
Oh, Team Leader.

266
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,410
The design team sent over the
 poster concepts this morning.

267
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,460
- Can you bring it to my office?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,250
Yoo Ri.

269
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,880
Can you research Cha Se Rin?

270
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,160
News articles and 
YouTube broadcast history.

271
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,960
Look up everything you can.

272
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,050
Yes, ma'am.

273
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Getting a head start is better, right?

274
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,500
Yes, let's do that. Yeah.

275
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,110
It's been a year since 
the management team

276
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,350
became independent 
from the marketing team.

277
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,260
Forget any tangible results.

278
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,250
As they're focused on 
attracting younger customers,

279
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,780
the existing customers
 are complaining all over.

280
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,480
We must observe at least

281
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,750
two to three years 
for tangible results.

282
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,700
The sales volume may be the same, 
but our market share has increased.

283
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,530
Even if we attract younger customers,

284
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,660
they spend less than half
 of the middle-aged customers.

285
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,300
It shows a rapid increase in 
spending power of the 20's and 30's.

286
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,500
Moreover, conducting marketing
 strategies targeting the VIPs

287
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,820
who are bringing in the 
primary sales volume.

288
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,220
Isn't it an outdated and 
off-trend statement?

289
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
What? An outdated statement?

290
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,530
That's enough.

291
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,300
We'll keep observing.

292
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,700
However,

293
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,050
Executive Director Ha
 does have a point.

294
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,470
You'll have to show us the numbers.

295
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,570
Yes, sir.

296
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,190
Impeccable.

297
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,230
It's quite impeccable.

298
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,370
One would be completely fooled.

299
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,870
The data on Cha Se Rin, 
per your request.

300
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,970
For now, I gathered
 all the online materials.

301
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,460
Are you making a book about her?

302
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,000
Pardon?

303
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,370
I don't have that much 
time on my hands.

304
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,330
Do it again.

305
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,530
I see.

306
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,490
Okay, will do.

307
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,290
Maximum of ten pages.

308
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,290
Pardon?

309
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,680
Don't go over ten pages.

310
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,980
Oh, okay.

311
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
Pull up her shopping
 preferences and organize them.

312
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,100
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,660
Where's Ms. Na Jung Sun's desk?

314
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,520
Over there.

315
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,780
It's from Mr. Park Sung Joon.

316
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,050
Aigoo, it's always someone 
else's wedding anniversary.

317
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,090
Our team leader doesn't
 look like the type,

318
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,000
but he's so romantic every year.

319
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,290
All right...

320
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,600
We'll proceed with the 
Cha Se Rin project.

321
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
- Everyone, get to it.
- Yes, sir.

322
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,380
What's the matter?

323
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,940
Huh?

324
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,250
You've been spaced out 
all day long.

325
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,140
Well, I'm a bit under the weather.

326
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,390
Oh, really?

327
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,210
Hyun Ah.

328
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,090
Never mind.

329
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,730
What is it?

330
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,170
You're no fun.

331
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,190
I'll use the restroom real quick.

332
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,980
Okay.

333
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,890
See you tomorrow.

334
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,410
 Great job. 

335
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,480
- Thank you.
 - Good job. See you tomorrow. 

336
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
- Okay!
- All right, good.

337
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,600
 

338
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,820
Team dinner on our first 
wedding anniversary?

339
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,710
♫  My way  ♫

340
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,210
Wow, you're the best.

341
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,510
Wow, seriously, the best.

342
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,620
Director, you're amazing!

343
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,800
I've always given my all.

344
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
He's in a jovial mood.

345
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,970
Hey.

346
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,900
Assistant Manager Na, 
sing us a song.

347
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,560
No, my throat isn't feeling well.

348
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,520
Hey, come on now.

349
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,900
Ms. Na, you're the best
 singer on our team.

350
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:40,793
Pardon me, Team Leader.

351
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,103
- I'll...
- Let me...

352
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,403
I'll do it.

353
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,103
Manager Park, you'll sing for us?

354
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:50,683
Aigoo, you've never 
sung for us before.

355
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,303
Great!

356
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,560
Gosh, walking is sobering me up.

357
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,590
Honey, I had no idea 
you're such a great singer.

358
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,870
What?

359
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,830
They're all ruined.

360
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,950
You had it with you the whole time?

361
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,120
I'm sorry.

362
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,620
I'll get you prettier flowers next time.

363
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,780
No.

364
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,410
These are pretty, too.

365
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,610
Thank you.

366
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,130
 Thank you. 

367
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,790
 Here's to what's ahead. 

368
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,900
Why did you do it?

369
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,310
When on earth...

370
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,040
How long has it been?

371
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,350
It was like an accident.

372
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,980
Even if you find out...

373
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,210
it'll only hurt you.

374
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,460
Are you pretending to 
be concerned for me?

375
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,890
If so, you should've
 denied it till the end.

376
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,150
I was planning to.

377
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,780
That was my plan...

378
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,760
till the end.

379
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,540
But...

380
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,340
when you were questioning me,

381
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,220
I had to deceive you...

382
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:50,070
and I couldn't do it.

383
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,710
Is it someone I know?

384
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,880
No.

385
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,470
I wish you would die.

386
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,950
Both you and that woman. 
I wish you'd just die.

387
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,870
I know I have no right to say this,

388
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,080
but...

389
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,580
I'll repent for the rest of my life.

390
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,910
I'll be punished until the day I die.

391
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,700
Jung Sun, please...

392
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,460
Could you give me 
one more chance?

393
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,910
I can't...

394
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,770
I can't lose you like this.

395
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,120
You already have.

396
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,200
 

397
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,380
Hello.

398
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,600
Hi, hi.

399
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,260
Hello, Assistant Manager Cha.

400
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,050
Oh?

401
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,630
Ms. Lee, you haven't met 
Mr. Cha yet, right?

402
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,640
This is Manager Lee Hyun Ah.

403
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,600
She was on our team, but she returned
 last month from a leave of absence.

404
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,300
This is Assistant Manager Cha Jin Ho.

405
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,070
While you were away, 
he joined the PR Team.

406
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,970
He's in charge of our team. 
You'll be seeing him a lot.

407
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,430
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hyun Ah.

408
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,460
It's you, huh?

409
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,730
From the hotel...

410
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,700
I mean, the elevator.

411
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,210
Have you two met before?

412
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,880
No.

413
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,110
It seems Mr. Cha has me 
confused with someone else.

414
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,860
Shall we go?

415
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,500
Pardon me.

416
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,080
Oh, Team Leader Park.

417
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,120
Let's talk later.

418
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,330
 

419
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,940
Then we'll expect it by next week.

420
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,530
Jung Sun, you lost weight.

421
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,400
Is Hyung not feeding you well? Huh?

422
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,740
You must've been 
flustered last time, right?

423
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,050
Geez...

424
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,100
If you missed me, 
you should just say so.

425
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,200
I'll give you a discreet 
phone call, Jung Sun.

426
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,700
That day...

427
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,930
I was overreacting due to alcohol.

428
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,400
Jin Ho, by any chance...

429
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,230
It's Team Leader.

430
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,610
Take it.

431
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,650
Hello?

432
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,060
Manager Lee.

433
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,330
Here's the list of new 
products per your request.

434
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,090
Okay, thank you.

435
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you have something else to say?

436
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,160
Manager Lee, the backup
 prep for the trunk show.

437
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,300
Could you assign it to 
Sang Woo and Yoo Ri?

438
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,660
I'm in charge of the trunk 
show's main product exhibition.

439
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,320
Since when do you pick and 
choose your assignments?

440
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,730
That's not it...

441
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,280
Since I'm in charge of the big event,
 I really want to deliver.

442
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Sang Woo and Yoo Ri are more than 
sufficient for backup work...

443
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,000
You must really want a promotion.

444
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,470
The show must succeed to
 hold the product exhibition.

445
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,310
You're telling me to babysit the 
two newbies while prepping.

446
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,020
Sorry, but that can't be.

447
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,210
Either do both,

448
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,080
or if that's too difficult...

449
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,210
then pass off the product exhibition.

450
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,530
My apologies. I've made a mistake.

451
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,760
As you said, I organized
 it into ten pages.

452
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,890
Good job.

453
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,190
The leaflet for the event.

454
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,980
Do you want to give it a go?

455
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,550
Me?

456
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,510
Look at the previous samples, 
then create a draft.

457
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,670
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,660
Gosh, I'm sorry.

459
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,890
Are you okay?

460
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,240
Truthfully, the backup work won't
 count in my personal evaluation.

461
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,200
If backup work keeps piling up

462
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,500
and my project performance suffers...

463
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,200
I'm worried.

464
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,330
Ms. Na, as you know,

465
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,460
I really need a promotion this year...

466
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,470
I'll discuss it again with Manager Lee.

467
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,140
Thank you.

468
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,760
Mi Na.

469
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,100
By chance, did Team Leader 
give you a separate assignment?

470
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,330
No, he didn't mention anything else.

471
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,890
A few days ago,

472
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,820
you had a separate meeting 
with Team Leader.

473
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,480
Oh...

474
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,570
No, nothing of that sort.

475
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

476
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,530
Oh, no!

477
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,100
Are you okay? Isn't it hot? Aigoo...

478
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,840
It's cooled off. I'm okay.

479
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,090
- Go to the restroom and wash up.
- Okay.

480
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,360
 

481
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
 

482
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,660
Luckily, it didn't splash too much.

483
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,790
You have a call.

484
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,210
Yes.

485
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,890
Excuse me.

486
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,160
Yes, Aunt.

487
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,790
Hey! She's here. She's here!

488
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,190
She's here!

489
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,680
VIP Cha Se Rin.

490
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,120
All of a sudden, without notice.

491
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,210
What should we do?

492
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,650
Send her back for today?

493
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,030
We haven't organized 
everything yet.

494
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,660
Let's take her to the
 conference room.

495
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,100
Okay. Aigoo, seriously...

496
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,540
I own the copyright,

497
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,650
but if you use the clip for
 promotional purposes,

498
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,520
what will be the terms for that?

499
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,890
Our legal team will review the 
contract based on the market value.

500
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,250
When all is organized, 
we'll send over the contract.

501
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,620
As stated before,

502
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,220
I'll attain the full editing rights.

503
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,200
Even if the video is
 not to your liking,

504
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,780
you have no choice.

505
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,980
Yes.

506
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,730
Here is the list of products 
for this trunk show.

507
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,460
It'll be good for you to preview it.

508
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,270
Will you be okay?

509
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,150
Pardon?

510
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,180
If I don't like something, 
I'll be saying so.

511
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,200
Will you be okay with these?

512
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,260
This is a preliminary list.

513
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,100
We're updating the list as we speak.

514
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,640
Since the target audience 
is teens and 20's,

515
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,220
we'll forgo formal wear and select 
neutro style casual wear.

516
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,970
Such as tie-dye print shirts 
and bicycle shorts.

517
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,230
We'll prepare trending 
styles from overseas.

518
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,950
For example, "ugly shoes." 
Why don't we match

519
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,420
each season's hot items?

520
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,220
She seems to know her stuff.

521
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,200
Make sure I can use all 
the bullets in the arsenal.

522
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,910
It's a big event. I don't want 
any disappointments.

523
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,450
Yes, will do.

524
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,700
Wow, that was no joke.

525
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,960
I felt the conference
 room freeze over.

526
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,930
Running a sizable
 company at her age.

527
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,360
She's not an ordinary girl.

528
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,900
I didn't know Ms. Lee was 
an ace. How amazing.

529
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,980
I was impressed.

530
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,770
Why that little brat...

531
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,040
- Ms. Kang.
- Yes.

532
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,940
If the clip shows her rejecting 
our recommended products,

533
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,310
the damage will be enormous.

534
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,840
Analyze the customer's preference 
again and renew the list.

535
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,920
Yes, sir. Will do.

536
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,950
Ms. Lee, please stay on top of it.

537
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,930
Yes, sir.

538
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,910
Geez, that was humiliating...

539
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,000
You should've notified me ahead.

540
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,740
She barged in without notice.

541
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,950
You're an expert in what 
teens want in luxury brands.

542
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,470
You're born to be 
a little rich girl, huh?

543
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,430
Team Leader Park is
 about to kill me.

544
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,190
His eyes were shooting laser beams.

545
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,780
The upper management is 
keen on this event.

546
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,040
I knew this project
 would be a headache.

547
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,110
I had a bad feeling.

548
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:15,810
Are we in the three-years-tribulation?

549
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,000
Manager Lee.

550
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,580
Wow, how can this be...

551
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,660
Repeated coincidences 
must mean a connection.

552
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,250
I'm truly shocked right now. Really.

553
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,180
Twice at work and by coincidence...

554
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,960
They say the third time is the charm,

555
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,540
but you seem to want to ignore it. 
We'll stick to twice.

556
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,860
I'll just have to make it 
happen once again.

557
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,370
Whoa, whoa, 
you're coming on strong...

558
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,460
Aigoo, really...

559
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,060
I told you I don't play 
a losing game. Didn't I?

560
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,340
You do remember.

561
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,260
If I said no...

562
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,150
you should accept it.

563
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,370
If you pester me at
 work one more time,

564
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,680
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

565
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,200
Unless you want to be humiliated,

566
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,930
you better stop acting up.

567
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,860
I'm in trouble.

568
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,900
She's so hot...

569
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,250
I have a meeting with the agency.

570
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,270
Call my cellphone for 
any urgent matters.

571
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,320
Yes, sir.

572
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,460
Isn't that meeting tomorrow?

573
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,440
I'm meeting with the
 Advertising Team.

574
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,550
Please excuse me for a bit.

575
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,630
I have to run out. I'll be back.

576
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,350
Ms. Na, what are you doing here...

577
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,380
I have to work off-site,

578
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,560
and I saw you heading out.

579
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,660
It's our turn to pick up the
 kids from school this week,

580
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,970
so we called for a helper.

581
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:50,000
But she called saying she couldn't 
make it all of a sudden.

582
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,540
Why didn't you say something?

583
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:58,510
I felt bad mentioning this 
when we're so busy.

584
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,920
I'm sorry.

585
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,490
I envy you and 
Manager Lee sometimes.

586
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,900
You always look so confident.

587
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,930
I think I lack in both being 
a mom and a team member.

588
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,160
I want to excel in both,
 and I'm making an effort...

589
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,060
but everything is a mess.

590
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,720
Everyone has their 
own cross to bear.

591
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,750
Hello?

592
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,290
 Hey, Honey. 

593
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,140
 We're having a team dinner tonight. 

594
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,830
And?

595
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:41,270
I'm working late, so you're 
supposed to go home early.

596
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,010
Yeah, but...

597
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,400
It's the entire team dinner, 
and they want me there.

598
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,270
What should we do?

599
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,830
I have to finish this today, too.

600
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,020
Aunt is going home soon. 
Will you leave the kids alone?

601
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,450
Just this once.

602
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,370
Just this one time.

603
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,090
Yes! I'll be right there.

604
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,750
Honey, I have to get going.

605
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,450
Please do me this favor today.

606
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,700
I'm sorry.

607
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,090
Yes!

608
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,360
 The phone is turned off. 
You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

609
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,300
Goodness, seriously...

610
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,670
Team Leader.

611
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,530
The agency will implement 
what you said today

612
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,330
and will send over 
a revised proposal tomorrow.

613
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:43,960
Okay.

614
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,100
I have a question.

615
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,360
You said it's over, right?

616
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,010
And it's someone I don't know.

617
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,640
Anything else I should know?

618
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,670
I'm asking if there are 
more crushing blows left.

619
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,800
No, there isn't.

620
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,900
There better not be.

621
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,640
Otherwise, I'll never forgive you.

622
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,760
You better take this to your grave.

623
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,600
Go on as if nothing happened.

624
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,920
I'll do the same.

625
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:23,400
I'll make an effort to forgive you.

626
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,120
I don't know if it's possible, though.

627
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,650
It'll be unbearably hard.

628
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,090
I'll go to hell and back many times.

629
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,410
But I still want to try.

630
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,130
I'll trust you one last time.

631
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,130
Jung Sun...

632
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,360
Don't ever betray me again.

633
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,140
Were you waiting for me?

634
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:44,430
Yeah.

635
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,110
Have a seat.

636
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,530
Okay.

637
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,880
What's the matter? 
You're scaring me.

638
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,310
- Honey.
- Yes.

639
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,640
I can't do this anymore.

640
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,740
What?

641
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,460
I'm leaving.

642
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,570
What?

643
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,390
 Mi Na. 

644
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,200
 Mi Na. 

645
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,580
 Mi Na, open the door. 

646
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,110
 Mi Na. 

647
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,840
 Mi Na? 

648
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,170
 

649
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,400
 Mi Na. 
 

650
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,650
 Open the door. 

651
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:44,600
 Mi Na. 

652
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,520
 Mi Na... 

653
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,250
 

654
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:55,070
♫  To bring me home  ♫

655
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:57,690
♫  You understand  ♫

656
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:02,930
♫  Don't stand me up
I want to go away  ♫

657
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:05,700
♫  I won't go back  ♫

658
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,410
♫  I'm falling down  ♫

659
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,520
♫  I cannot explain  ♫

660
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,300
♫  Don't bring me down  ♫

661
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,700
 

662
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:22,390
♫  Don't bring me down  ♫

663
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,640
♫  Oh baby, don't want to know 
if the mystery exists  ♫

664
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,310
♫  Cuz I won't see him no more
I don't care   ♫

665
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,680
♫  Wind blows away  ♫

666
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,090
♫  I've lost my way  ♫

667
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,420
♫  There's nothing left  ♫

668
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,060
 This time, it's different than before. 

669
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,800
 - As if something's shattered...
- You should split up. 

670
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,830
 After this project, I'm considering 
you for the management team. 

671
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,320
 Don't create any 
unnecessary problems. 

672
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,240
 Please track down the
 sender of a text. 

673
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,400
 - Is it what I'm thinking?
- I must turn things back. 

674
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,100
 Everyone has their place. 
I overstepped my boundaries. 

675
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,300
 The computer user 
who sent the text... 

676
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,360
 What? 

677
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,670
♫  I won't go back  ♫

678
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:07,170
♫  I'm falling down  ♫

679
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,670
♫  I cannot explain...  ♫
