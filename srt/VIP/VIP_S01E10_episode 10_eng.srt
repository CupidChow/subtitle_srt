1
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,330
 Please don't go. 

2
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,810
I knew we had to stop, too.

3
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,300
"We have to stop.

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,390
Because it's wrong."

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,060
Ms. Na is such a good person and

6
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,700
I can't believe I did this to her...

7
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,440
I thought that, but...

8
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,090
I can't.

9
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,960
I can't get rid of my feelings for you.

10
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,440
I've never been greedy 
about anything in my life.

11
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,350
I never have, but...

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,210
just this once...

13
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,290
Can I be greedy just this once?

14
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,710
I won't be greedy about 
anything ever again.

15
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,450
The punishment...

16
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,870
I'll take the punishment.

17
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,410
Please, just once.

18
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,650
 

19
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,540
Congrats.

20
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,860
Thanks.

21
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,120
Thank you for congratulating
 me, everyone.

22
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,390
We'll celebrate some other time.

23
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,600
You all worked so hard 
on the Tifóne exhibition.

24
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,540
I feel like I haven't been 
attentive to you.

25
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,680
To celebrate all the work
 you put in for Tifóne

26
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,250
and to celebrate 
Director Park's promotion,

27
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,590
I thought we should get together.

28
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,050
Because of all the rumors
 floating around work,

29
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,130
I'm sure you were very 
much concerned.

30
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,820
It's all due to my lacking.

31
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,900
So blame it all on me.

32
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,170
And as for the new member who 
was misunderstood and hurt.

33
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,010
I ask for your encouragement 
and support.

34
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,750
Since our event was 
a huge success,

35
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,980
let's enjoy the food tonight,

36
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,280
drink and work harder.

37
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,180
- Sung Un! 
  - Sung Un! 

38
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,440
Yoo Ri...

39
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,010
You went through 
a lot recently, huh?

40
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,140
People are so weird.

41
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,650
People shouldn't gossip

42
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,790
about others when they
 don't have the facts straight.

43
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,870
I know.

44
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,320
Cheers?

45
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,020
Cheers.

46
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,750
Power sure is good.

47
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,800
Shouldn't we say 
something as well?

48
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,050
Sang Woo, the workplace is, 
you know...

49
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,000
You must line up to
 the right superior.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,650
Be nice to Yoo Ri now.

51
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,150
Yoo Ri is the VP's daughter.

52
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,820
She's not the VP.

53
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,040
Are you a silver spoon 
or something?

54
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,410
Is work your hobby?

55
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,080
Well, anyway, you know...

56
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,630
Deputy General Manager 
is the boss of our team.

57
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,520
Ms. Na is my priority in my book.

58
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,920
What?

59
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,030
You still seem to be full of passion.

60
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,720
If you were your old self,

61
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,780
you'd be standing first and foremost
 in that line, pushing others away.

62
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,840
Aren't you lacking passion
 for work these days?

63
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,570
For being overlooked
 for a promotion?

64
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,410
Are you enjoying your dinner?

65
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,600
Thank you.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,210
I heard you carried a big load

67
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,080
for the Tifóne project, Ms. Na.

68
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,990
Good job.

69
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,630
Don't mention it.

70
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,540
Everyone worked so hard.

71
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,070
Do you know that the biggest
 reason I like Director Park

72
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,920
is because of you, Ms. Na?

73
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,300
The fact that he has such 
a talented and upright wife.

74
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,680
The fact that he has 
such a healthy family.

75
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,000
This is why I highly value Director Park.

76
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,260
Thank you.

77
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,250
I want to invite you two to dinner 
with my wife and me this weekend.

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,930
I'm sorry, but...

79
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,180
we have a family gathering

80
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,760
that's been arranged long ago.

81
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,460
It's such a rare occasion.

82
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,390
We'll make it work.

83
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,100
Are you overextending 
yourself because of me?

84
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,570
No, we're not.

85
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,740
I'm sure our parents will understand

86
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,070
when we tell them.

87
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,940
All right, then.

88
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,680
I'll let Director Park know 
of the time and place.

89
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,850
And...

90
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,180
she lacks a lot in many ways.

91
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,400
Please teach and lead her.

92
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,290
I think I can trust you 
with her, Ms. Na.

93
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,250
Yes, sir.

94
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,300
Thank you.

95
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,600
All right...

96
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
let's drink.

97
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,980
 I'm not sure what you're thinking... 

98
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,400
but it's not me.

99
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,470
What's not you?

100
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,390
Pardon?

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,010
The woman who's having 
an affair with my husband

102
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,620
isn't you? Is that what 
you want to say?

103
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,180
Did you know, Ms. Na?

104
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,290
Since when and how 
did you find out?

105
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,320
Has it been long?

106
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,970
By chance, am I the 
only one in the dark?

107
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,080
No, I happened to see 
them together...

108
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,220
It seemed like it was 
over already, so...

109
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,360
if it passes without 
your knowledge...

110
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
I thought that would've been better.

111
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,310
I see.

112
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,300
Sung Joon still doesn't 
know that I know.

113
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,130
Pretend not to know.

114
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,540
I have to get going.

115
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,220
Get some rest. Don't overdo it.

116
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,220
It's not good for the baby.

117
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,740
Oh, oh.

118
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,410
I got a call from Aunt.

119
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,950
Young Joon got hurt, and
they're at the ER.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
- What? 
 - Let's go.

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not sure if Yoo Ri is 
doing a good job.

122
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,900
- For me... 
 - I have to use the restroom.

123
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,050
Manager, I have an 
emergency at home.

124
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,300
I have to go.

125
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,150
Are you sure you got 
the right person?

126
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,190
I think you should go over there.

127
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,620
For her, I think you need to
take a number and wait.

128
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,290
Where are you staying these days?

129
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,460
Are you staying in a hotel?

130
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,340
A sunbae I know is working 
at an overseas branch

131
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,670
for six months, and his
 place is empty.

132
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,680
He said I could use it if I need it.

133
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
But I don't really need it.

134
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,590
Just let me know if you need it.

135
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,160
What's with you?

136
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,960
At this rate,

137
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,870
you should stop coming onto 
me for being insulted.

138
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,460
Is it about your pride or 
competitive edge?

139
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,930
Well...

140
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,930
I'm just being nice as a co-worker...

141
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,400
I guess I'm stepping over
 the boundary, huh?

142
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,900
At first...

143
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,130
I was just curious.
 Just my curiosity.

144
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,500
But...

145
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,280
I started liking you.

146
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,200
I can't explain it any other way.

147
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,370
Mom!

148
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,550
Are you okay?

149
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,860
I got stitches.

150
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,210
Cool, huh?

151
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,850
I'm so sorry.

152
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,350
I thought they were 
playing well together.

153
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,700
They were sword fighting and got a cut on his forehead.

154
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,500
Do you know how scared we were?

155
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm taking away your 
lightsabers for now.

156
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,680
This is nice.

157
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,600
No, because you came, Mom.

158
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,680
Mom, are you getting divorced?

159
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,090
What?

160
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,520
Do you even know what that means?

161
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,060
No, Joo Hyuk said...

162
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,220
that if Mommy and 
Daddy live separately,

163
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,600
it means they're getting divorced.

164
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,040
It's not like that.

165
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,570
Just wait seven days.

166
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,490
I'll be home after seven days.

167
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,900
- Really? 
 - Really?

168
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,510
Oh, yay!

169
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,710
Glad you got hurt.

170
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,650
No, I mean I'm glad you 
only got hurt this much.

171
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm glad it's not worse. Right?

172
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,630
So cute.

173
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,850
My baby.

174
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,590
The bandage looks good on you.

175
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Let's ride together.

176
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,400
- Go on home now. 
 - Yes, sir.

177
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,210
 Goodnight. 

178
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,090
Wow, they're riding together.

179
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,440
Is she going to become 
an executive at this rate?

180
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,080
 I'm so jealous. So jealous. 

181
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,570
 I know. 

182
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,080
Let's go.

183
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,530
Where are you going?

184
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,200
You've been through a lot.

185
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,000
 

186
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,730
You'll be in charge of the 
entire Marketing Team

187
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,810
including the VIP 
Management Team.

188
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,570
The Marketing Team is a core 
element of Director Ha's department.

189
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,030
He won't let it go easily.

190
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,910
I think it's better to avoid

191
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,350
a big confrontation for
 the time being...

192
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,860
Do you think...

193
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,220
that video clip was 
released by accident?

194
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,250
It wasn't shakey and high quality

195
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,140
considering someone out 
of curiosity recorded it.

196
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,710
I'm saying that the camera was set 
up and was recorded intentionally.

197
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,320
Then...

198
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,130
- what you're thinking is...
- Right.

199
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,930
When you're shot at with an arrow, 
I should return a cannon.

200
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,110
So that they won't 
mess with us again.

201
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,800
The team leader spot for the 
VIP Management Team

202
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,510
will be open for a while.

203
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,610
Hand things over to Ms. Na.

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
- Yes, sir. 
 - And...

205
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,560
assign some real 
projects to Yoo Ri.

206
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,310
It'd be good if her performance
 were visible to others.

207
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,700
But don't give her
 something too big.

208
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,960
I also want to see how 
much she can handle.

209
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
Yes, will do that.

210
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,340
For now, Ms. Na will step
 in as the team leader.

211
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,360
We'll work together while 
we transfer our duties, but

212
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,090
discuss all work-related 
agendas with

213
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,290
Ms. Na from now on.

214
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,910
- Yes. 
 - Yes, sir.

215
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,020
We're planning to renew 
VIP customer service.

216
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,270
This renewal will proceed...

217
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,880
- under Ms. Na. 
 - Yes, sir.

218
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,210
That's all.

219
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,630
Ms. Lee.

220
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,820
Yes?

221
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,200
I want to put Ms. On

222
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,220
in charge of selecting
 customers' anniversary gifts.

223
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,110
We receive feedback right 
away as far as that's concerned.

224
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,230
Don't you think it's too 
much for Yoo Ri?

225
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,540
On Yoo Ri will have to learn sooner 
than others how to be responsible.

226
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,790
Yes, sir.

227
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll give her the instructions.

228
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,220
If you assign her separately,

229
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,440
it can be seen as giving 
her special treatment.

230
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,500
I think it's best for me 
to put her in charge.

231
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,010
I think you're right, Ms. Na.

232
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,720
- Please proceed. 
 - Okay.

233
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Yes?

234
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,990
Well...

235
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,640
Managing Director, I want to 
take about three days off.

236
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,030
I'm not sure if I should 
speak to you or Ms. Na.

237
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,860
Did you make your decision?

238
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,360
Yes.

239
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,930
All right.

240
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,390
I'll talk to Ms. Na.

241
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,670
If you need more time to recover, 
 take additional days off.

242
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,700
Thank you for keeping my secret.

243
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,440
 Sung Joon still doesn't
 know that I know. 

244
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,070
 Pretend not to know. 

245
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,500
Team Leader.

246
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,980
I'll just tell Ms. Na that 
I'm taking a few days off.

247
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,400
- All right. Do that then.
- Okay.

248
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,790
We have to consult the

249
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,250
Marketing Team on the 
media buys and PR messaging.

250
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,570
Ms. Lee, please work with Mi Na.

251
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,660
Okay.

252
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,900
Yoo Ri will be in charge of 
renewing customers' gifts.

253
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,630
Excuse me?

254
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,320
Sang Woo, please support 
her as you proceed.

255
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,940
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,600
You got an amazing project.

257
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,700
On Yoo Ri.

258
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,330
Yes?

259
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,120
Here is a list of gifts that were
 sent out to VIP customers

260
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,620
on their birthdays or 
anniversaries since 2010.

261
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,210
We usually make our selection 
based on the trend each year.

262
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,020
You go ahead and select

263
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,540
what kind of gift would be 
good for this year's renewal.

264
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,130
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,570
Come this way.

266
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,080
I've been so busy lately

267
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,950
that I finally get to meet with you.

268
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,880
As for the video clip...

269
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,680
I couldn't help it because 
of the orders from the top.

270
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,480
As an employee, I can't ignore the orders
 from the top in an organization.

271
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,250
But the thing is...

272
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,090
Because the things went
 down the way it did...

273
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,740
the higher-ups are antsier now.

274
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,520
Asking me for another solution.

275
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,990
So...

276
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,470
you'll have to help out once more.

277
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,040
How could I...

278
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,950
Everyone has skeletons
 in their closet.

279
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,900
As for you and me, too...

280
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,240
Look through 
Director Park's computer.

281
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,010
His phone, too, if possible.

282
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,820
I only took that video 
because you said

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,450
you wanted to see the event.

284
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,230
- If I knew it'd be used this way... 
 - Seriously?

285
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,290
Aren't you a smart one, Mi Na?

286
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,600
"He wouldn't have asked me to 
record this secretly like this for that."

287
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,330
Didn't you think that?

288
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,270
You knew but thought,

289
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,430
"Let's just turn a blind eye."

290
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,690
Isn't that right?

291
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,320
Fortunately, I'm the only 
one who knows that

292
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,950
you recorded that.

293
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,040
But if that fact is leaked...

294
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,230
it will be big trouble 
for you, not just me.

295
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,950
I take full care of my people.

296
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,260
Except...

297
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,490
only when I'm sure that 
person is working for me.

298
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,740
I hope this won't take long.

299
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,920
I don't have too much time myself.

300
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,150
- Mr. Cha.
 - Yes.

301
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,160
If you have time,

302
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,710
would you like to have
 dinner with me?

303
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,830
Sounds good.

304
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,100
You know what?

305
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,290
It was the first time

306
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,530
you spoke to me 
suggesting something.

307
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,240
Is that so?

308
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,930
This is nothing.

309
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,530
But I was touched.

310
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,850
Mr. Cha...

311
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,940
You're a good man.

312
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,750
That day...

313
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,830
This isn't a good start.

314
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,950
Isn't this an introduction
 to a rejection?

315
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,900
I'm sure you know this since
 you heard me that day.

316
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,620
I'm a bit too preoccupied these days.

317
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,120
My family is a mess, and...

318
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,270
I'm a mess as well.

319
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,660
So, for me to understand someone

320
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,770
and to be in a relationship...

321
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,550
I just don't have the
 peace of mind for that.

322
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,710
I just thought that it would be polite

323
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,230
for me to speak to you properly.

324
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,400
Well...

325
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,470
This is tough.

326
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm sorry if I burdened you.

327
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,530
I fully understand how you feel.

328
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,720
So I'll keep my boundary 
as a co-worker going forward.

329
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,190
Thank you.

330
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,030
Nothing's going my way.

331
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,570
Divorce?

332
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,880
Are you crazy, Hyung?

333
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,710
You're crazy.

334
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,970
Wow...

335
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,890
Is it that woman, by chance?

336
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,340
Are you going to live 
with her or something?

337
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,310
It's not like that.

338
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,320
If not, then why get divorced?

339
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,590
In life,

340
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,490
that can happen. 
You can make a mistake.

341
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,670
I mean...

342
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,310
let's be generous and say you could 
have an affair in passing.

343
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,030
Then you should live the rest 
of your life being apologetic.

344
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,420
To put it bluntly,

345
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,810
all married couples 
go through a crisis.

346
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,060
Everyone endures through
 that and live like that.

347
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm not even married, and 
I know that. How could you...

348
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,900
I was going to. That's what
 I was going to do.

349
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,140
But...

350
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,180
when I see her...

351
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,220
my heart aches.

352
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,190
So I can't look at Jung Sun straight.

353
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,930
But...

354
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Huh?

355
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,710
What...

356
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,150
What about that woman...

357
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,470
made you this way?

358
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,100
 
 Yes, I'm at the hospital 
where On Hye Sun is.

359
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,970
Yes, I'll take care of it that way.

360
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,830
Park Sung Joon?

361
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,550
How dare you come here...

362
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,900
What's going on?

363
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,750
How did you come here...

364
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,620
Did you call this jerk?

365
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,900
- That Father is hospitalized? 
 - No.

366
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,840
I guess blood is thicker than water 
even though you're illegitimate.

367
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,340
Why are you doing this?

368
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,090
Honestly, I don't feel sorry for
 Father in that condition at all.

369
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,570
He made Mother suffer all her life

370
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,740
and bore you punk after 
having an affair with your mom.

371
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,140
If it weren't for Mother's request,

372
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,370
I wouldn't have cared if 
that man lived or died.

373
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,550
Stop it.

374
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,330
Mother will be here soon.

375
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,050
Get lost from here.

376
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,340
Annoying punk.

377
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,970
Geez...

378
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,500
I want to throw up 
when I see his face.

379
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,900
How dare he. He always keeps
 his mouth shut, and...

380
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Oppa, let's go in.

381
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,400
We've done enough.

382
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,810
We called ourselves 
sinners for over 30 years,

383
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,110
we begged and got beaten.

384
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,510
Whenever you came to 
me asking for money,

385
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,890
I gave you all that money as well.

386
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,010
What, a**hole?

387
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,150
My mother lived her whole
 life in guilt and anxiety.

388
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,270
Even still, she can't sleep 
without sleeping pills.

389
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,020
Even in the future,

390
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,330
she'll live like that until she dies.

391
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,710
- Isn't this enough? 
 - Enough?

392
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,860
Did you say, "Enough?"

393
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,200
You and your mom 
destroyed a family.

394
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Anxiety?

395
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,050
Guilt?

396
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,300
My mom lived with anger in her 
heart because of your mom.

397
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,800
She lived a lonely life waiting for my father,

398
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,100
who left for another woman. And what?

399
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,700
You've done enough?

400
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,450
Give me a break.

401
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,600
The perpetrator doesn't 
get to decide

402
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,660
if the punishment was appropriate.

403
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,730
The victim gets to decide.

404
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,690
I didn't want to be born 
this way either.

405
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,510
What, a**hole?

406
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,590
Look at him. Just because
 you've got a mouth...

407
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,780
What are you doing?

408
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,090
People are watching.

409
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,120
Go inside.

410
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,030
I paid off all the outstanding bills.

411
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,500
The Vice President...

412
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,340
is suggesting a nursing 
home with better facilities.

413
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,700
No...

414
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,600
She's been here a long time,

415
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,120
so the nurses are well 
aware of her condition.

416
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,870
She'll just stay here.

417
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,380
It's more convenient here.

418
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,420
I'll tell him that then.

419
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,510
All right then.

420
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,580
Please don't worry.

421
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,820
I won't tell anyone.

422
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,790
Yes.

423
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,870
What?

424
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:16,867
 

425
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,637
Are you going out?

426
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:22,517
Someone I know...

427
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,347
passed away.

428
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,477
Do you...

429
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:33,517
want to go with me?

430
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:36,187
Do I know that person?

431
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:39,087
No.

432
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,567
Get some rest. 
You're not feeling well.

433
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,797
I'll be back.

434
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,127
S***...

435
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,567
I called him.

436
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:15,127
Yes, Vice President.

437
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,907
Great job.

438
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:25,477
You must be coming
 from a funeral?

439
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:27,077
Yes.

440
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:42,637
I can't believe I'm 
showing you this.

441
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,777
Could you please 
take Yoo Ri back?

442
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:49,487
I have to get going first.

443
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,717
Please comfort her.

444
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:53,017
Yes, sir.

445
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:16,187
I wanted to go to a place like that.

446
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:19,387
But I never have.

447
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,007
It's okay.

448
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:46,657
Someone must've passed away.

449
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:55,867
When you die...

450
00:33:57,507 --> 00:34:00,357
does it really all end?

451
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,567
The past...

452
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,537
the sadness...

453
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:08,357
and pain.

454
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:12,597
Will they all disappear?

455
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,677
I wish I had never been born.

456
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:22,817
My mere existence...

457
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,987
hurts everyone.

458
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:29,097
Rather than being like this,

459
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:33,047
it would've been better if 
I had never been born.

460
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:37,417
I keep thinking that.

461
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:44,577
It's not your fault, Yoo Ri.

462
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,067
Being born like that...

463
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:54,847
It's not your fault.

464
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,087
Thank you.

465
00:35:28,747 --> 00:35:30,247
Are you okay?

466
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,577
Yes, I am.

467
00:35:35,197 --> 00:35:37,287
You sit here, too, Team Leader.

468
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:38,777
It's really comfortable.

469
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:42,497
Sit down.

470
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:44,037
Like this.

471
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,087
No, what gives?

472
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:48,927
Like this. Sit like this.

473
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:51,087
Just sit here, please.

474
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,527
Team Leader...

475
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:07,797
Is something the matter?

476
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,167
You look sad today.

477
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:38,897
It's just that...

478
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,297
I feel so empty.

479
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:48,637
My father...

480
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:51,447
passed away.

481
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:55,967
After finding out I was 
the son of his mistress...

482
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:00,047
if people asked me
 about my father,

483
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:03,427
I told them he was dead.

484
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,497
Even to my wife.

485
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:13,567
Everyone thinks he's
 dead anyway.

486
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,877
I thought I'd feel better 
if he really died.

487
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,657
You can cry.

488
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,257
It's a sad thing.

489
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,927
It's okay if you cry.

490
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:44,927
I thought I would be fine...

491
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,987
even if he died.

492
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,957
But why...

493
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,707
I did not wish for him to die.

494
00:38:07,437 --> 00:38:09,567
But how could he go like that...

495
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,367
You know...

496
00:38:36,267 --> 00:38:39,067
a flaw you want 
to keep to yourself...

497
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:42,867
She found out about it somehow,

498
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,297
but I was strangely relieved.

499
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:49,987
That it was okay to be like that...

500
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,067
was comforting to me.

501
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,407
You have something
 like that, Hyung?

502
00:39:02,097 --> 00:39:04,947
Even so, Jung Sun 
would know about it.

503
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,667
 

504
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:27,797
Wine or flowers have 
been the most popular.

505
00:39:27,797 --> 00:39:29,277
Ms. Kang, why use 
honorifics all of a sudden?

506
00:39:29,277 --> 00:39:30,787
Sang Woo, what do you mean?

507
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,417
I may be casual in 
a personal setting,

508
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:35,077
but I'm always polite and 
use honorifics during work.

509
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:36,707
You spoke casually 
to me just now...

510
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:40,387
Actually, only a few

511
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,987
flower vendors can cater 
to the VIPs' preferences.

512
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:44,807
So it overlaps with other brands.

513
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,557
The VIPs here are usually

514
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:49,257
VIPs at other places, too.

515
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:51,277
Then a unique gift would be good.

516
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:53,207
That's right.

517
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:54,737
Thank you.

518
00:39:54,737 --> 00:39:55,947
What, for this?

519
00:39:55,947 --> 00:39:57,837
It's pretty standard.

520
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:11,447
Yes.

521
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:31,037
Wow, I had no idea our 
co-workers were so polite.

522
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:35,467
Should we get some fresh air?

523
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,167
Have a good day.

524
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:51,057
Wow, the air sure is nice.

525
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:58,147
Yoo Ri, do you have a boyfriend?

526
00:40:58,147 --> 00:40:59,727
Pardon?

527
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:03,397
If you don't,

528
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,537
I want to introduce you to someone.

529
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,837
No.

530
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:10,477
No need...

531
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:12,047
I'm totally fine.

532
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:16,867
I think you'll be sincere

533
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:19,367
when you date someone, Yoo Ri.

534
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,847
I guess you have someone like that.

535
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,727
Pardon?

536
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:33,967
It says so on your face.

537
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:47,857
You must've been into him.

538
00:41:55,027 --> 00:41:57,877
Ms. Na, I think we 
should go back inside.

539
00:41:57,877 --> 00:42:00,567
I forgot I have to do something.

540
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:01,927
What I'm saying is...

541
00:42:01,927 --> 00:42:03,597
Ms. Lee asked

542
00:42:03,597 --> 00:42:05,967
if we're coming back 
right after the meeting.

543
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,377
Doesn't that mean 
we have work to do?

544
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,517
Then shall we?

545
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:36,497
Yes, Na Jung Sun from the 
Management Team speaking.

546
00:42:36,497 --> 00:42:38,207
Oh, Ms. Na.

547
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,087
I called Mi Na's extension.

548
00:42:40,087 --> 00:42:42,467
Mi Na is out today, so I picked up.

549
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:44,557
Oh, that's right.

550
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:47,047
She told me this 
morning, but I forgot.

551
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,807
I'm a bit crazed these days.

552
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:51,517
Okay, have a good day.

553
00:42:54,357 --> 00:42:57,457
 

554
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:06,747
 Because I won't have the baby. 

555
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:13,987
Ms. Na.

556
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:15,847
What do you think of these?

557
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:18,887
We send flowers the most.

558
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,607
For a customer's birthday 
or an anniversary,

559
00:43:21,607 --> 00:43:24,277
how about a diffuser made with their birth flower?

560
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:27,107
If we source a famous 
perfumer like Myongil

561
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,777
and make a birth flower booklet

562
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,577
showing the diffuser
 production process,

563
00:43:31,577 --> 00:43:34,207
- I think it'll be nice.
- Sounds good.

564
00:43:35,377 --> 00:43:38,517
First, let's find out if it's doable.

565
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:40,757
Yes, ma'am.

566
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:49,537
 The phone is turned off. You'll be
 connected to the voicemail. 

567
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:52,127
 After the beep, 
there will be a charge. 

568
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,727
Ms. Kang introduced Michelle Canet,

569
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,867
the perfumer whom 
we had collaborated with.

570
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:10,397
She won the "Rookie
 of the Year Award"

571
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,317
at a competition in 
France last year.

572
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,587
It'll be a good PR for us.

573
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:15,967
Contact her and see if
 a sample can be made.

574
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:19,867
But I don't speak French.

575
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:31,937
Bonjour.

576
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:35,777
This is the VIP Management Team
 of Sung Un Department Store.

577
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:37,407
I see.

578
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:41,017
You spoke with Ms. Kang
 over the phone.

579
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,207
Yes.

580
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:43,497
That's good.

581
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:44,717
Okay.

582
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:46,907
Then I'll send you an email.

583
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,057
Yes.

584
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:50,607
That's all. Thank you.

585
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:56,827
It seems Ms. Kang
 already spoke to them.

586
00:44:57,567 --> 00:45:00,867
Organize the contents and
 send it to this email.

587
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,917
You can email them in English.

588
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,887
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,367
And show me first 
before sending the email.

590
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:12,567
Yes, ma'am.

591
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:33,717
 

592
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,647
We'll administer anesthesia.

593
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:57,137
Please wait.

594
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,897
I can't do this.

595
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:11,267
 I said, you can't go in there! 

596
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:13,677
 My wife is in there. 

597
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:25,147
Honey, what are you doing here...

598
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:29,807
Let's go out first.

599
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:31,567
Let's talk outside.

600
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,477
- Honey...
- Mi Na, let's leave.

601
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,097
Let's go.

602
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:36,967
Hurry up. Let's leave.

603
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:39,307
- Let go.
- Let's go, Mi Na.

604
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,677
I couldn't get a hold of you.

605
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:53,617
I went to the studio 
because I was worried.

606
00:46:56,437 --> 00:46:58,377
I saw your maternity journal there.

607
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:03,127
I was so flustered and 
called the hospital.

608
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,667
They said your
 appointment is today.

609
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,467
I couldn't believe it 
was for abortion.

610
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:11,897
How could you not say 
anything to me...

611
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:14,487
If I had, you would've 
wanted to keep it.

612
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,867
How can you get rid of a baby?

613
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:21,767
Because I have no
 intention of keeping it.

614
00:47:23,157 --> 00:47:25,457
Did you leave home 
because of this?

615
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:31,107
Saying "Let's keep it" is easy.

616
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:34,997
You're the good guy, 
and you want to keep it,

617
00:47:34,997 --> 00:47:36,417
but what about afterward?

618
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:39,227
What will you do then?

619
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,747
In the end, I'm the one 
who has to deal with it.

620
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:50,547
- I...
- It's our baby.

621
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:55,137
Even though I'm an idiot, 
you still should've told me.

622
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:59,377
For you to do as you please...

623
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,627
Song Mi Na, you're scary.

624
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:11,867
I had no idea how scary you are.

625
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:45,727
 

626
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,537
I wrote up the email.

627
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:00,217
 

628
00:49:02,427 --> 00:49:04,257
Send it to my email.

629
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:06,957
Yes, ma'am.

630
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:25,417
I revised the email. 
Use that one.

631
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:26,527
Okay.

632
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:31,267
 

633
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:35,617
My apologies.

634
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:38,307
You're going home late 
because of me.

635
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:45,237
You said this before, Yoo Ri.

636
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:48,747
That everyone has their place.

637
00:49:48,747 --> 00:49:50,627
You're right.

638
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:53,167
The employees 
assigned to our team

639
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:55,027
are in constant contact 
with foreign vendors.

640
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,907
They're able to communicate
 in basic English.

641
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,067
You joining our team.

642
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:02,467
What I'm saying is...

643
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,467
it's special treatment.

644
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,467
Sang Woo joined us 
six months before you did,

645
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,577
but he still only assists.

646
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:16,667
We usually don't entrust a newbie 
with a big project like this.

647
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,197
This is also special treatment.

648
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:21,307
The special treatment you couldn't get

649
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,267
unless you're Vice President's daughter.

650
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:26,557
And that is your place.

651
00:50:27,677 --> 00:50:30,207
So, no need for an apology.

652
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:34,267
You're sitting here 
because that's your qualification.

653
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:39,357
I guess you want to 
be a nice person, too.

654
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:40,917
Please don't.

655
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,867
It makes me more uncomfortable.

656
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:50,907
But still, as for the view...

657
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,917
it's a killer.

658
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:44,687
Why did you agree to this?

659
00:52:44,687 --> 00:52:45,867
Don't misunderstand.

660
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:49,837
It's not for your sake, at least.

661
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:03,717
Yes.

662
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:05,767
It's not like we're strangers.

663
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,027
I thought it'd be good to
 converse over a meal.

664
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:09,577
So we brought Yoo Ri.

665
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:16,687
Have a seat. Sit.

666
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:26,917
My wife rarely 
pays compliments,

667
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:28,947
but she took a liking
 to you, Ms. Na.

668
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:33,327
You have good sense 
and work with dignity.

669
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:36,037
The VIPs have high regard for you.

670
00:53:36,037 --> 00:53:37,507
Thank you.

671
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:40,777
I like your calm manners.

672
00:53:41,977 --> 00:53:44,247
You have a great wife.

673
00:53:44,247 --> 00:53:45,687
Yes.

674
00:53:57,797 --> 00:53:59,697
Team Leader, there are almonds...

675
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:12,417
Honey, you're allergic to nuts.

676
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,217
That's what you
 mean, right, Yoo Ri?

677
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:22,827
Well, I guess Yoo Ri

678
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:24,767
and Director Park 
have gotten close.

679
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,667
You even know his palate.

680
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:41,717
Truthfully, the reason
 I'm here today

681
00:54:41,717 --> 00:54:43,977
is to tell you something.

682
00:54:45,937 --> 00:54:48,077
It may be uncomfortable,

683
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,107
but I think you should 
be aware of it, sir.

684
00:54:51,107 --> 00:54:52,607
Jung Sun.

685
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:56,207
My husband...

686
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:58,047
and Yoo Ri.

687
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:04,527
They said they're in love.

688
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:21,267
I asked Director Park for a favor.

689
00:55:21,307 --> 00:55:23,887
I think you're misunderstanding him

690
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,507
taking care of Yoo Ri on my behalf.

691
00:55:25,507 --> 00:55:27,077
It's not like that.

692
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,667
I guarantee it.

693
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:43,607
Is it true?

694
00:55:51,887 --> 00:55:54,277
I think you should discuss matters privately.

695
00:55:54,277 --> 00:55:56,297
I'll get going first then.

696
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:07,667
My apologies.

697
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:16,157
Let's talk.

698
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,637
About what?

699
00:56:18,637 --> 00:56:21,907
You deceiving me 
without blinking an eye?

700
00:56:21,907 --> 00:56:25,487
You mocking me right 
in front of my eyes?

701
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:27,767
How can your infidelity...

702
00:56:29,227 --> 00:56:30,777
be so dirty?

703
00:56:33,037 --> 00:56:35,737
Because of your dirty deed,

704
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:38,337
the past ten years
 I spent with you

705
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:40,247
became a nightmare
 in an instant.

706
00:56:40,247 --> 00:56:44,007
You're turning every
 moment into hell right now.

707
00:56:48,677 --> 00:56:51,837
I'll show you what it's like
 to lose everything.

708
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:55,157
Let's go together...

709
00:56:56,507 --> 00:56:57,787
to hell.

710
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:21,547
Let's talk tomorrow.

711
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:52,327
 

712
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:57,457
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

713
00:59:59,397 --> 01:00:05,347
♫  Set me free from 
these nightmares  ♫

714
01:00:06,847 --> 01:00:12,207
♫  Set me free from this pain  ♫

715
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:20,617
♫  Set me free from 
these nightmares  ♫

716
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,447
 Do you have anything 
to say to Ms. Na? 

717
01:00:22,467 --> 01:00:24,167
 You should learn how to 
speak to your subordinates. 

718
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:27,067
 - I was sincere.
- You destroyed someone's entire life. 

719
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:29,067
 I don't care. As long 
as I can be with him. 

720
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:31,177
 It's not good to get
 involved with Director Bae. 

721
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:33,397
 Mi Na, you don't seem like 
a woman with two kids. 

722
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,877
 We still have a chance, right? 

723
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:38,257
 If you two break up, 
will we have a chance? 

724
01:00:38,257 --> 01:00:40,907
 
 I'll stay by your side. 

725
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:48,767
♫  From the memories 
which have faded   ♫
