1
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,930
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,016
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,188
I don't want to do it.

4
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,108
Do what?

5
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,652
Being disappointed.

6
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,950
It's not your fault anyway.

7
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,123
I don't want to bad-mouth your family.

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,291
I just…

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,877
I just…

10
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,633
What's wrong with me?

11
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,930
I've lived well until now.

12
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,059
So what do I lack?

13
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,071
I value myself

14
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,574
more than anyone else.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,665
So I want to give up.

16
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,921
You said I could

17
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,007
make a mistake.

18
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,765
I hoped

19
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,895
that we'd just have problems of our own.

20
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,984
Because that kind of stuff
is something we can work on.

21
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,278
It's within our control.

22
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,622
But when it comes to external problems,
I have to endure them.

23
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,585
And I don't like doing that.

24
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,381
Whenever I was faced with
relationship issues,

25
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,633
all I had to do was
just end the relationship.

26
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,761
It was my instinct to run away.

27
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
Because I hated letting myself get hurt.

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,275
This is why I didn't want to meet you.

29
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,613
I knew I'd end up saying this
considering how I felt.

30
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,120
Do you want to break up?

31
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,584
I'm a coward, aren't I?

32
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,088
The fact that I made you say that first.

33
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,801
So you want to break up.

34
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,905
Where's the courtesy?

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,283
Even if you're a coward,

36
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,120
how could you make me say it first?

37
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,751
The only mistake you made today

38
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,504
was making me say it first.

39
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,888
You could've slept on it.

40
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,855
Let's give each other some time.

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,609
It's the least you can do for me.

42
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
I think I deserve that much.

43
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,158
Don't I?

44
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,620
You deserve it. You do.

45
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,509
Okay.

46
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,180
Okay then.

47
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
That's good enough. I'll be off now.

48
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,378
EPISODE 13

49
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>I think my dad knows
that you guys go around holding hands.</i>

50
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,862
I got scared that he might have
a separate file for me too,

51
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,074
so I started looking for it.

52
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,242
But there wasn't one.

53
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,328
You're his daughter.

54
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,996
Seon-gyeom is his son.

55
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,335
There is this guy I love.

56
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:21,255
My dad put him through a lot as well
behind my back.

57
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,592
How did he handle it?

58
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,345
He always ran away,
and I always went after him.

59
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,598
I stopped counting
once it reached the fifth time.

60
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,603
I'd go anywhere to find him
no matter where he runs off to.

61
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,900
I wonder how Seon-gyeom will react
if you ever run away from him.

62
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,446
Haven't you ever thought
that he might run away?

63
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,490
Seon-gyeom never runs away.

64
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,995
Do you think

65
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,916
I don't deserve to be with Seon-gyeom?

66
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,627
Are you treating me like a mean
sister-in-law already?

67
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,337
Don't think of me like that.

68
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,466
I sometimes feel like I don't deserve him.

69
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,803
When I'm with him,

70
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,181
I sometimes end up
being faced with my flaws.

71
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,851
And I lose focus on my work.

72
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,312
I'm able to focus better on work
if my love life is stable.

73
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,981
Love is great.

74
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,903
But I never want to lose focus on my work
no matter what happens.

75
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,074
It's kind of like losing myself.

76
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,372
I'll try to help Seon-gyeom
the best I can.

77
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,708
But I'm also quite a mess these days.

78
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,086
I figured it was only right

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,840
to tell you first
before telling Seon-gyeom about it.

80
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,763
I hope he never finds out.

81
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,477
I just want us to concentrate
on each other for now.

82
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,736
By the way, why do you go after him
every time he runs away?

83
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,282
Because I know how much he loves me.

84
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,869
That's why he runs away.

85
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,115
Will you turn off the alarm?

86
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,204
My class begins in the afternoon.
Turn off the alarm.

87
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,001
Have fun running.

88
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,929
You don't always have
to overcome everything.

89
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,389
You can rest on the weekends.

90
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,220
SEO DAN-AH

91
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,351
Her grandfather, father,
and older brother…

92
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,770
Wait. They all have "myeong"
in their names

93
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,315
except for Ms. Seo.

94
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,776
Is it because she's pretty?

95
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,696
And I don't see Seo Tae-woong.

96
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,740
Is he really a competitor?

97
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,867
Ms. Seo is way too attractive.

98
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,996
It's Ms. Seo's birthday soon.

99
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,290
I see. Okay.

100
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,584
First, let's apply for the charity run.

101
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,505
I'm done applying.

102
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,512
Gosh, I was hoping you'd respond,
but I didn't get anything out of you.

103
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,859
Is something wrong?
You didn't even go running today.

104
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,028
My goodness.

105
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,447
Tell me what's on your mind.

106
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,533
Don't take it out on the laundry.
These are our clothes.

107
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,786
Does she

108
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,582
really want to break up?

109
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,005
Did I give her a hard time
while we were together?

110
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,176
I thought I tried my best,

111
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,262
but was that not enough?

112
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,683
Did that pile up

113
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,773
and eventually make her explode
because of my dad?

114
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,486
Now I totally get why you weren't
folding the laundry properly.

115
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,449
Is there anything I can do to help?

116
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,123
If you're done with that milk,

117
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,001
wash the carton and recycle it.

118
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,256
You got it.

119
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,928
Then can I ask you for a favor as well?

120
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,972
It's nothing big.

121
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,019
Sure. Go ahead.

122
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,067
I thought you never wanted
to eat <i>japchae</i> again.

123
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,070
I need to use the ingredients I bought.

124
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,453
That's not what I meant.
You can find recipes online.

125
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
So why ask me for help?

126
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,207
What if I know the recipe?
It needs to taste good.

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,712
How could everything taste so bad
when you chop so well?

128
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,882
-Maybe your mouth is the problem.
-My mouth is always the problem.

129
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,426
Is there anything else I need to chop?

130
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,724
May, I kind of get why you cook.

131
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,145
While I was cooking,

132
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,566
I only thought of how dull the knife was

133
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,445
and if I had to chop the garlic
or mince them.

134
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,116
"I should send resumes tomorrow
so I can keep myself busy with work."

135
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,787
I didn't think of that kind of stuff.
It was kind of like running.

136
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,539
It's a different form of meditation.

137
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,752
That's why I always ask you
to be my cooking assistant.

138
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,754
Do you see the big picture?

139
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,965
That's what makes you a great CEO.

140
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,636
You need to rest like it's an obligation
in order to last in this business.

141
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,264
Working is resting.
You're always busy with work yourself.

142
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,974
After I started my own firm,

143
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,311
I realized that CEOs also love
receiving monthly paychecks.

144
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,064
My dream was to live off monthly salaries.

145
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,358
Why did I have to start my own business?

146
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,612
The movie you worked on
is going to hold a preview,

147
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,780
so come watch it with him.

148
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,533
You should watch your subtitles
on the big screen.

149
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,994
Oh, that.

150
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,997
It's like you.

151
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,459
That's how I feel about that movie.

152
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,424
Don't disappear.

153
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,345
Be with me forever.

154
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,931
I won't.

155
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,146
I said that only to run away myself.

156
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,942
Maybe I'm a piece of trash.

157
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,820
I really need to watch what I say.

158
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,321
What are you thinking?

159
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,241
It's the weekend, and I'm overcoming it.

160
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,201
Today's a weekday.

161
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,745
I'm so quick to lecture others.

162
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,497
Today's a weekday.

163
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,262
FAMOUS RICE BURGERS

164
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,224
Where's the valet?

165
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:02,443
Why are you suddenly
asking about the ballet?

166
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,363
"Ballet"?

167
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,950
The valet…

168
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,870
Who's going to park my car?

169
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,581
People do that for you?

170
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,917
I've never heard of that before.

171
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,881
Who told you to park here?

172
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,342
-Then where should we park?
-You can't park here.

173
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,218
Why aren't you using honorifics?

174
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,013
I'm sorry. Just a second.

175
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,600
My school is nearby,
so let's just park the car there.

176
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,269
We'll leave. Sorry.

177
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,863
It better be worth all this trouble.

178
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,990
You told me you want to know
what's inside me.

179
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,952
I'll show you before I put it inside me.

180
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,963
Did you think I might kiss you?

181
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,424
I'd be lying if I say no.

182
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,388
I thought I hurt you.

183
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,431
Do you know how rude it is to say that?

184
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,685
You tend to hold a grudge.
And it lasts quite a while.

185
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,645
What exactly did I do to hurt you?

186
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,981
It's better to tell me than to sue me.

187
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,232
Sue you? Why?

188
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,943
Do you think you'd win
if you file a lawsuit against me?

189
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,946
-It's for your own sake.
-Why would I sue you?

190
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,614
Why must we fight at all?

191
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,450
-You have no friends, do you?
-Why would I need friends?

192
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,910
You don't make friends out of need.

193
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,620
You just naturally make them.

194
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,541
Then do you want to be my friend?

195
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,505
You just hurt me by saying that.

196
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,926
I hurt you again? What hurt you?
How did I hurt you?

197
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,764
You didn't tell me
it's your birthday soon.

198
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,891
Do you have any plans then?

199
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,273
No, I don't. And I never will.

200
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,902
Then can we have a party and go on a date?

201
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,070
No.

202
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,997
Are they harvesting the rice?
What's taking so long?

203
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,959
Are you sure you're free that day?

204
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,128
-When?
-On your birthday.

205
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,171
I'm free.

206
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,674
Then let's meet.

207
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,009
Don't bring that up again.

208
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,304
What's the big deal about my birthday?

209
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,222
It's the day you were born.

210
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,476
Being born is a miracle in itself,

211
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,728
but you're also healthy and dating me.

212
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,984
What do you get out of
celebrating birthdays?

213
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,152
Their heart.

214
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,280
That stuff disappears.

215
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,657
It lasts longer because it's invisible.

216
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,910
Some feelings
even grow stronger with time.

217
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,164
You'll regret wasting your time.

218
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,750
I don't even know what will happen
in an hour.

219
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,794
Will you please meet me that day?

220
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,587
I'll tell you what happens in an hour.

221
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,923
-You're being bossy again.
-Let's just meet

222
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,509
another day to eat
and go for a drive like today.

223
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,469
-No.
-Stop saying no.

224
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,554
-I forbid you.
-You forbid a lot of things.

225
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,264
-No.
-You always say no to me too.

226
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,850
Your rice burgers are ready.

227
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,071
Let's stop.

228
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,323
Stop what?

229
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,451
We shouldn't argue
in front of the burgers.

230
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,873
Then what should we say?

231
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,542
"It's delicious."

232
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,296
It's delicious.

233
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,340
Why can't we meet on your birthday?

234
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,009
-So it's okay when you do it.
-Of course, yes.

235
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,178
-Couples spend time…
-Who says we're a couple?

236
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,307
Now that really hurts me.

237
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,184
I hurt you again?

238
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,146
Among all the stuff you said,
this hurt me the most.

239
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,400
What am I to you?

240
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,947
A vending machine.

241
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,076
If you cry again,

242
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,704
I might have to fix my vending machine.

243
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,999
After you bought me coffee,
I looked up all the vending machine menus.

244
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,959
I noticed that they sell hot chocolate.

245
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,753
I'm done eating.

246
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,965
Don't take it out on the food.

247
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:43,056
I wanted to catch Yeong-il's match,
but it wasn't broadcasted.

248
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,642
Articles flew out though.

249
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,147
He came in second place
at the National Sports Festival.

250
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,735
He only came to Seoul
to prepare for the event.

251
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,362
What if my presence made him lose focus?

252
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,534
He wouldn't have been a champion
if he was fazed by that.

253
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,581
Without you, I'm all alone.

254
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,751
Then you'll keep winning first place.

255
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,378
Maybe it was your presence
that motivated me.

256
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,716
I think he's just in a slump.

257
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,223
Would he come to help me train

258
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,266
-when he's devastated?
-Here he comes.

259
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,287
On your mark.

260
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,335
Get set.

261
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,244
Take it easy, will you?
You won't be competing soon

262
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,704
and the season is over.

263
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeong-il, will you continue
to ride your motorcycle?

264
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,835
I came here by car today.

265
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,921
Then what's with the helmet?

266
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,716
It's like a prop.

267
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,845
So it's your schtick?

268
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,347
Who taught you that word?

269
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,812
How can I give it up
when I enjoy being fast?

270
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,815
Seeing anyone go past me
makes my blood boil.

271
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,985
You know I came in second
at the National Sports Festival.

272
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,488
Never have I seen
anyone's back on the tracks,

273
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,865
but I did yesterday.

274
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,326
How did it feel?

275
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,828
Seeing the back of his head?

276
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,914
It wasn't all that bad.

277
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:19,129
But you just said that seeing the back
of one's head makes your blood boil.

278
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,090
It's not like I can look away though.

279
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,471
-I'll get some more beverages.
-No, I'll go.

280
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,974
-I won't be comfortable.
-But your leg…

281
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,142
It's fine.

282
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,774
The one who beat me said in an interview

283
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,860
that his goal was to break my record.

284
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,864
If I had come in at 10,00 seconds,

285
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,200
his record might've been under that.

286
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,204
If I run faster, those trying to beat me
will run faster too.

287
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,208
Our juniors running faster isn't so bad.

288
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,461
Exactly, and that's a pity.

289
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,090
That's what I think about that,

290
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,176
although others may think I'd be annoyed

291
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,719
that they're faster than I am.

292
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,146
-What was that for?
-I was comforting you.

293
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,236
-Don't do that again.
-Then win the race.

294
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,529
Stop it, will you?

295
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,621
Ms. Seo, let's say you have a kid

296
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,997
and that kid's all grown up.

297
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,625
How on earth
am I supposed to imagine that?

298
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,044
You hate that your son's dating a peasant.

299
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,506
You gave them a bribe
so that they'd go away

300
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,383
and threw a fit at their house.

301
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,510
But what if they didn't break up?

302
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,596
That parent must have a lot of free time.

303
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,349
Mr. Jeong, be careful what you let in!

304
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,061
Can I get you a drink? Tea or coffee?

305
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,230
I'd like a glass of cold water, please.

306
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,439
Mr. Jeong!

307
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,319
Why would you ask me that?

308
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,573
Because you're on the same level
as Assemblyman Ki.

309
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,617
Hold on.

310
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,619
Did you just say we're on the same level?

311
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,247
No, you did. You called me a peasant.

312
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,169
He'll be too busy soon
to keep caring anyway,

313
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,588
-so just stay put.
-Busy with what?

314
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,176
I see you don't watch the news.

315
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,470
<i>This afternoon, the preparatory committee
of Happiness and Freedom Party</i>

316
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,056
<i>confirmed its own election guidelines.</i>

317
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
<i>After failing to unify
the opposing parties,</i>

318
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,894
<i>Assemblyman Ki and Assemblyman No</i>

319
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,396
-<i>look to run…</i>
-I wonder who'll run for president.

320
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,565
<i>The two are known to be the front-runners.</i>

321
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,859
-As if I care.
-<i>Assemblyman Ki has maintained</i>

322
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,361
<i>a high approval rating during
his four terms.</i>

323
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,906
<i>Meanwhile, Assemblyman No
is right on his tail.</i>

324
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:55,160
He might win the in-house election,
but will never become a president.

325
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,245
I guess some would vote for him.

326
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,164
-Like whom?
-People like you.

327
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:01,917
Never.

328
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,797
You're still in the lead among
the assemblymen and women,

329
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,177
but party members seem to be
leaning toward Assemblyman No.

330
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,515
I see he'll be somewhat of a nuisance.

331
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,935
The opinion poll isn't
in your favor either.

332
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,395
It shows that the people want a new face.

333
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,738
Have my contingency plan ready

334
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,616
so that I can ruin him when I need to.

335
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,159
Yes, sir.

336
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,371
Should I continue to keep tabs
on your son?

337
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,958
What's the use? Leave him be.

338
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,711
I'll deal with the girl once and for all.

339
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,715
My gosh, this is exhausting!

340
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,099
Ji-woo, can you not be the first lady?

341
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,810
I'll lose my job if you stop acting.

342
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,271
As if anyone would let me be one.

343
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,398
I always consider
how your future will unfold

344
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,525
since it's directly linked to mine.

345
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,695
I chose my career over motherhood
to build an impressive filmography,

346
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,531
so why would I sacrifice it
for his career?

347
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:19,160
I wish to be known as Yook Ji-woo
and not someone's wife

348
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,329
until my coffin is shut and nailed.

349
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,373
This is my life we're talking about.

350
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,752
You know, Director Lee
has been giving us the eye.

351
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,920
This won't do.

352
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,258
Let's go and slice the rest up.

353
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,137
Ms. Oh, I have a question to ask too.

354
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,474
Why do people meet on birthdays?

355
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,893
Because it's a birthday.

356
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,438
He seems to be planning an event,

357
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,189
but my birthday isn't worth that.

358
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,275
I might be willing
to celebrate his though.

359
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,277
You're allowed but he's not?

360
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,946
That's always been the story for me.

361
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,741
I see you made up
after he ruined the painting.

362
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,995
This is the first time
someone's asked me out.

363
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,080
Is everything new for you?

364
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,582
Sorry about the sarcasm.

365
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,625
Well, you came to me first today.

366
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,669
Are you heading home?

367
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,212
I'll give you a ride on my way.

368
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,922
I haven't had my coffee yet.

369
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,674
No.

370
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,926
I forbid you from saying no to me.

371
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,178
No.

372
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,058
-I'll get going.
-Sure.

373
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,268
-Take care.
-You too.

374
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,837
I shouldn't have worked here.

375
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,467
Welcome.

376
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,427
One Americano to go, please.

377
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,903
It's a thief.

378
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,823
The thief is washing the dishes
to make a clean getaway.

379
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,952
What? Hey, it's you. Wait, are you drunk?

380
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,037
Look. It's a thief.

381
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,288
A thief?

382
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,918
I'm not a thief. My name is Ki Seon-gyeom.

383
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,963
Seriously?
Although he does often steal things.

384
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,383
-What do I steal?
-People's hearts.

385
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,803
He's my roommate.
You saw him asleep before.

386
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,848
Anyway, over here is my BF.

387
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,267
You know what that is, right? Best friend.

388
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,478
Well, I'm…

389
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,356
I mean… I'm Lee Yeong-hwa's friend.

390
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,736
-I'll be in the bathroom.
-Sure.

391
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,365
Are you all right? Want some honey water?

392
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
Do you like him?

393
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,414
The kid who painted that.

394
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,054
Is it fun for you to mess with him?

395
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,267
Is that what he says?

396
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,228
It's pretty obvious.

397
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,897
Obvious?

398
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,566
Obvious how? Like the size of my drink?

399
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,861
You must pick your toys randomly.

400
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,654
I can't tell who's messing with who.

401
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,240
The daughter of a CEO
dating a regular college student?

402
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,411
You seemed clueless,
so I made it obvious for you.

403
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,622
I see you size up people
in a subjective way.

404
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,665
Likewise.

405
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,711
Your attitude is backing up my suspicion.

406
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,088
It means I need another trump card.

407
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,508
Despite having everything in this world,

408
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,843
you'll have the advantage
since you're his friend.

409
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,221
If friendship is used
as a bargaining chip,

410
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,014
he'll choose you over me.

411
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,435
Why would I do that to him?

412
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,903
Here's the coffee you ordered.

413
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,532
Is not answering questions
a trend these days?

414
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,619
The answer you wanted isn't on the menu.

415
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,360
What should I do?

416
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,446
I don't feel good.

417
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,532
Do you feel queasy? Have some water.

418
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,450
Do you want to throw up?

419
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,417
What's up? Is something wrong?

420
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,710
You…

421
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,715
Have you been studying for the TOEIC exam?

422
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,051
-It's right around the corner.
-What?

423
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,513
I'm worried we won't get
to go to the States together.

424
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,975
What? Why would you worry about that?

425
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,103
I've been studying, okay? So don't worry.

426
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,897
Right.

427
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,692
Are you leaving?

428
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,612
Can you make it home yourself?
Let me take you.

429
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,405
No, I should manage on my own.

430
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:55,038
An order for Yook Ji-woo's movie came in.
It's for a film festival.

431
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,290
You didn't leave your number
on your resume,

432
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,876
so they contacted you through us.

433
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,169
You must be out of it.

434
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,963
The one she's currently filming?
<i>Killing Day</i>?

435
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,423
It'll take a while to wrap up.

436
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,092
No, the one she filmed before that one.
<i>Code Name Candy</i>.

437
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,427
No way.

438
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,889
She played a drug dealer
by the name of Candy.

439
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,932
I can't believe it.

440
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,851
Are you going to be all right?

441
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,979
She's his mom.
And the wife of that assemblyman.

442
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,732
To me, she's just an actress.

443
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,401
I can't pass up
on the once-in-a-lifetime chance.

444
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,195
You saw how he is with his son.

445
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,238
I'm worried he'll do that with his wife.

446
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,699
This is just a job, all right?

447
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,369
Don't make it out to be a personal matter.

448
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,667
Hey, Mi-joo.

449
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,669
Seriously?

450
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,514
I'm sorry, May.
My frustration got the best of me.

451
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,058
You've been harsher before.

452
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,185
Right. I was once a menace.

453
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,647
Do you apologize to him this easily too?

454
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,274
-You're not the same.
-Why are we different?

455
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,776
To keep seeing you,

456
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,445
I should apologize
as soon as I realize my wrongdoing.

457
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,782
You overlooked so many
of my mistakes in the past.

458
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,077
At times like this,
you prove you're quite stable.

459
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,622
You acknowledge when you're at fault
and apologize quickly.

460
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,790
But what?

461
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,001
I avoid matters
when my love life's involved?

462
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,211
I blame my shitty dating experience.

463
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,506
Whenever issues surface,
I try to solve it right away,

464
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,258
but they just wanted to break up.

465
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,884
You and your shitty ex-boyfriends.

466
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,762
"History will repeat itself,
so I should dump him first."

467
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,806
How could I not think that way?

468
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,307
You would.

469
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,560
It's like I was born to be abandoned,

470
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,563
-so who would like that?
-No one would.

471
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,690
So what references can I turn to

472
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,776
-when he asks for a break?
-None.

473
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,655
You do realize he's not like
your shitty ex-boyfriends though, right?

474
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,323
I do.

475
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,703
Do you know how far
my thought process has reached?

476
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,041
"I didn't like him enough
to muster up the courage

477
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,752
and face the conflicts.

478
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,338
I don't love him enough

479
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,924
to put myself
through the wringer for him."

480
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,218
-Don't ever do that.
-Of course.

481
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,346
Being in love means
you should protect one another.

482
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,639
That's right.

483
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,100
Damn! Stop thinking so far ahead.

484
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
This isn't what the break is for.

485
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,147
I know. This is me avoiding
the situation too.

486
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,449
-Right eye.
-The right.

487
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,501
-Where are you going all dressed up?
-What? Dressed up?

488
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,503
I have to look reliable.

489
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,890
-Blink.
-What?

490
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,309
Do that when someone says
you're not reliable.

491
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,479
-Like this?
-Yes.

492
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,776
Your eyes are… You know.
So make use of your talent.

493
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,238
All right.

494
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,573
"Hello."

495
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:22,411
<i>Hello, I'm here to represent
the athlete, Kim Woo-sik.</i>

496
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,914
SEJEONG CITY HALL
TRACK TEAM

497
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:33,422
I'm sorry to tell you this
when you've waited so long.

498
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,550
The coach is off at a training camp.

499
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,303
Well, that's fine.

500
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,222
Here.

501
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,059
These are Kim Woo-sik's stats.

502
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,563
Could you make sure that he takes a look?

503
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,064
-Sure.
-Thanks.

504
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,740
<i>Hello, I'm here to represent
the athlete, Kim Woo-sik.</i>

505
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,867
Sure. Come on in.

506
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,244
Hello.

507
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,079
Mr. Ki. So this is how we meet.

508
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,166
I'm the manager
of the Jieum Construction Track Team.

509
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,584
-Have a seat.
-Right.

510
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,377
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

511
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,589
I heard the rumor about
you being Kim Woo-sik's manager.

512
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,756
Right.

513
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,925
I hope your father's well.

514
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,304
Yes, he's good.

515
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,056
Anyway, I'm here on behalf of Kim Woo-sik,

516
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,767
-not as my father's son.
-I'm just making small talk.

517
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,895
So how is Kim Woo-sik doing?

518
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,980
He's been working hard on his recovery.

519
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,861
Here. These are Kim Woo-sik's stats.

520
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,280
Also attached are the results

521
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,073
of his recent physical examination.

522
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,326
The rumor must be true.

523
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,995
You're representing him.

524
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,082
You see, people have been saying
that you're a nobody now.

525
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,338
Why are you supporting a whistleblower

526
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:58,090
with the resources you have?

527
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,635
I'm frustrated, that's all.

528
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,262
You're not going to be able
to help him like this.

529
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,768
I don't quite follow.

530
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:12,647
These stats would be enough
if it were yours.

531
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,942
We'd even be glad to sign Kim Woo-sik
as a two-for-one deal.

532
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,985
I didn't mean to offend you.

533
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,822
-I hope you weren't offended.
-Of course not. I'm fine.

534
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,576
-Thank you for your time then.
-No worries.

535
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,939
I miss her.

536
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,908
Wasn't it nice to spend
some time together?

537
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,328
It's about time we cut this out.

538
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,122
Ms. Kim says we're like a couple
in our sixties.

539
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,709
Why don't we end the date
with a movie and a GB?

540
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,045
What's a GB? Ginger beer?

541
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,547
Gruesome beer?

542
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,215
You're being absurd.

543
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,509
GB means a glass of beer.

544
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,346
As if a glass is ever enough.

545
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,514
-Seriously?
-It never ends with one glass.

546
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,434
-How about 12 bottles?
-Come on.

547
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,287
I guess she's fine.

548
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,166
I'm glad.

549
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,629
I'm glad. I really am.

550
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,270
Don't you feel safe

551
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,856
when you're sitting in a dark theater?

552
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,316
That's why I like theaters.

553
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,419
TRANSLATION: OH MI-JOO

554
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,856
TRANSLATION: JANG BYEONG-UK

555
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,907
<i>If I timed myself today,</i>

556
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,034
it might have been
a little over nine seconds.

557
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,828
Nine seconds? Is that good?

558
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,289
Gosh, of course. Totally.

559
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,211
You came to watch a movie with me,
didn't you?

560
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,365
Is it because I played
video games yesterday?

561
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,910
Did I play for too long?

562
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,912
How long has it been?

563
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,622
What do you mean?

564
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,499
Do you have the yips?

565
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,876
YIPS, SUDDEN LOSS OF SKILLS
IN EXPERIENCED ATHLETES

566
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,211
I don't know.

567
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,846
Have you stopped wasting your time
on other people?

568
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,598
Yes, thanks to a tattler.

569
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:01,060
You've been the best all this time.
Why the yips now that you're with me?

570
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,229
Maybe it's because I was the best…

571
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,273
It's my duty to report.

572
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,026
Is it the company's motto to tattle?

573
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,945
Were you really on a diet?

574
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,406
I know you'd ask me to lose weight
if I was modeling your clothes.

575
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,742
You know we don't have a double standard.

576
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,621
You're an athlete, not a model.

577
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,665
It's a problem
if it affects your main job.

578
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,500
How do you know that that's the cause?

579
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,835
Because it's our job to locate the cause.

580
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,420
We're considering everything.

581
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,173
Does it hurt to look nice
for a commercial?

582
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,424
The shoot is global.

583
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,843
You're known for your skills,
not your body.

584
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,137
Then what do you expect me to do?

585
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,016
Why is everyone bitching at me?

586
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,185
What do you want me to do?

587
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,479
What should I do?

588
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,197
Are things tough these days?

589
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,783
We just

590
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,036
wanted you to train more comfortably.

591
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,663
Why do people keep crying in front of me?

592
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,291
My life's been shitty these days.

593
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,001
Don't provoke me.

594
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,046
-She's sick. Let's go to a hospital.
-Ms. Seo, please.

595
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,048
Watch what you say.

596
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,968
Why should I?
The core problem will remain the same.

597
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,803
She needs to get well if she's sick.

598
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,559
Eun-bi, don't you worry, okay?

599
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,477
Don't take it to heart.

600
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,689
I was worried…

601
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,417
Just tell me if you don't know.
You've been at it for 15 minutes.

602
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,669
You should be done before Ye-jun comes.

603
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,172
I'm not killing time.

604
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,840
I just need a bit more time.

605
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,925
Then at least jot something down.

606
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,761
Is it all in your head or something?

607
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,018
<i>I've confirmed the sketch.
You may begin coloring.</i>

608
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,228
She texted me.

609
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,938
-I should…
<i>-No useless replies.</i>

610
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,776
She told me not to reply.

611
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,820
I've never felt happy
to be told not to do something.

612
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,074
-What's with that face?
-Why? Am I handsome?

613
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,036
Goodness, you look like a handsome idiot.

614
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,288
I'm an idiot in love. Jealous much?

615
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,499
-I guess it's good being an idiot.
-No, it isn't.

616
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,209
-I'm not jealous at all.
-Liar.

617
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,670
-No.
-No.

618
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,470
What are these balloons for?

619
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,848
Now you're asking
after blowing all of them?

620
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,183
To throw Ms. Seo a party.

621
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,102
I even bought a gift.

622
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,854
So you've made it up the tower.

623
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,398
What tower?

624
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,150
You mean Rapunzel?

625
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,153
Do you know what happens in the end?

626
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,282
The prince tries to climb the tower

627
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,284
and becomes blind

628
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,120
because he approached her.

629
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,997
I guess he saw the witch, not Rapunzel.

630
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,584
That's not it. The witch made him go blind

631
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,878
because he saw Rapunzel.

632
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,463
Don't you know cause and effect?

633
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,594
This wasn't what I wanted to get at.

634
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,181
I guess I'm weak when with you.

635
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,811
Move.

636
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,567
I ordered a cake from your cafe.

637
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,068
It's going to look pretty.

638
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,945
So what if it is? It should be tasty.

639
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,449
And I borrowed my roommate's car.

640
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,577
I'm going to make the balloons float
out of the trunk.

641
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,703
You get it, right?

642
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,164
They need helium to float.

643
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,293
You should've told me sooner.

644
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,794
You just told me now.

645
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,216
Right. I should buy some helium.

646
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,887
Hey, they will shrivel up by then
if you do it today.

647
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,306
I told you in advance.

648
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,184
Why did you tell him that?
We could've ruined it!

649
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,561
What? Ruin what?

650
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,105
Quit your nonsense.
You're not ruining anything!

651
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,315
-I will!
-Don't!

652
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,774
-I will!
-Don't!

653
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,734
I will!

654
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,738
You should focus on your love life,
not his.

655
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,406
Are you an idiot?

656
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,324
Me?

657
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,075
Is this a WWJD thing?

658
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,954
And you say you've quit church.
What a man of virtue.

659
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,831
That's Confucianism.

660
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,832
Good for you.

661
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,626
You should change your name to Jesus.

662
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,963
Why are you so sensitive?

663
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,799
Being a senior must be a free pass.

664
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,885
Ye-chan.

665
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,180
Why have you been so edgy today?

666
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,140
It's because I'm a senior. So what?

667
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,309
I'm studying all day
to get into a university.

668
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,770
I'm already irked
that you're college students.

669
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,813
Do you like Yeong-hwa?

670
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,690
Over my dead body.

671
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,859
I have high standards. No, thank you.

672
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,653
Go buy some <i>hotteok</i> for me.

673
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,863
Sure.

674
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,532
Hello.

675
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,161
-It's nothing much.
-Thank you.

676
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,413
What brings you here, ma'am?

677
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,166
I haven't been attentive
to Ye-chan lately.

678
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,252
I'm worried she might be
bottling things up

679
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,170
and will explode soon.

680
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,881
I heard school violence is severe
these days.

681
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,968
Ye-chan wouldn't do such a thing.

682
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:30,180
I'm not talking about her being the bully.
I'm afraid she's the victim.

683
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,974
I found some bruises on her.

684
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,935
That's probably from boxing.

685
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,688
Ye-chan gets along very well
with her friends.

686
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,772
Sorry?

687
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,942
From what again?

688
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,570
They keep making us do things together.

689
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,697
I guess we're really going to debut.

690
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,240
That's the trend these days.

691
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,658
Tae-woong.

692
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,952
Explain these comments
on your social media.

693
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,620
What?

694
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,248
<i>We were done ages ago,</i>

695
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,292
<i>so why are you still following me, babe?</i>

696
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,837
<i>Stop thinking about me, babe.</i>

697
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,589
That little…

698
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,257
What a psycho!

699
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,217
"Babe"? Has he gone insane?

700
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,553
Delete them before the fans go berserk.

701
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:12,431
Thank god that happened
after our radio show.

702
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,849
Damn it.

703
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,727
Are you glad our fans didn't
bombard the live comments?

704
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,812
What a great leader you are.

705
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,272
That's my job.

706
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,523
Damn it.

707
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,900
I'll keep the car running, so come out.

708
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,112
He's unbelievable.

709
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,490
-Our fans are going to get hurt.
<i>-You call cannot be reached…</i>

710
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,409
This bastard isn't picking up.

711
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,253
<i>I deleted, unfollowed, and blocked you.</i>

712
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,464
<i>You better not leave any more comments.</i>

713
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,558
<i>Who told you that you could call me?</i>

714
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,934
<i>Do you want a beating?</i>

715
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,736
<i>No, thanks.</i>

716
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,990
That was a rhetorical question.

717
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,495
<i>I'm busy preparing for a birthday party.</i>

718
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,956
<i>I hope this is
our last time talking, babe.</i>

719
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,501
Who cares if you're preparing
for a birthday party?

720
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,427
Mr. Jeong, it's me.

721
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,888
What's Dan-ah's schedule today?

722
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,975
Okay. Got it.

723
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,936
Where are you going?

724
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,729
Somewhere.

725
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,692
-The company would want to talk with us.
-None of it is true, so why?

726
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,443
It's not my fault.

727
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,779
It's not mine either,
but I should still go

728
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,155
because I'm the leader.

729
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,532
Damn it.

730
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,704
Hey, babe! Over here!

731
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:07,421
I mean, I'm glad
we don't have class today,

732
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,047
but you look pathetic right now.

733
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,299
-So does your face.
-Talk to the hand.

734
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,096
No! Have you gone insane?

735
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,681
A birthday party for my sister?

736
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,225
-Seo Tae-woong?
-Why are you here?

737
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,019
Wait. What did you just say?

738
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,396
Have you gone insane?

739
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,398
Don't ruin her day. Call it quits.

740
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,108
No, before that.

741
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,359
What?

742
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,653
Your sister?

743
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,157
Don't act so friendly.
Even I've never called her that.

744
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,534
Then what else should I call my sister?

745
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,828
She's my sister!

746
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,788
What?

747
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,040
You were siblings?

748
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,084
We still are, you asshole.

749
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,545
Who are you to plan my sister's birthday?

750
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,755
Me?

751
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,091
I'm her vending machine! So what?

752
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,011
What are you rambling on about?

753
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,847
Hey, what are you doing?

754
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,933
Oh, god. What are you doing?
My gosh, do you even know who he is?

755
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:05,103
-You're damn crazy.
-Who is he?

756
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:08,315
Ye-jun! How dare you push my friend?

757
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,983
-You little…
-Ye-jun!

758
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,318
-Ye-jun!
-Come here!

759
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,278
-Ye-jun!
-You pretty boy!

760
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,988
-You asshole!
-Stop!

761
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,364
Who the hell are you?

762
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,283
-Gosh.
-Let's talk this out.

763
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,202
-Hold on.
-Who are you?

764
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,328
-Oh, no.
-Come here!

765
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,789
Why were you so late? I'm outnumbered.

766
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,457
I was parking. Yeong-hwa, wait.

767
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,751
Don't do that! No!

768
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,211
-Hold on!
-Oh, dear!

769
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,463
-You little…
-Guys!

770
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,006
-Come here!
-Oh, come on!

771
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,510
My hair! Time out!

772
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,725
-Hey, you!
-Fight outside!

773
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,852
-Get out!
-Get out!

774
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,229
Let go of me!

775
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,093
Mi-joo. Seon-gyeom. You're here.

776
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,387
Hey.

777
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,265
-Have you been well?
-As always.

778
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,143
-Let me go.
-You let go first.

779
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,352
Goh Ye-chan!

780
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,438
-Mom?
-Ms. Dong.

781
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,856
Hello, ma'am.

782
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,816
-Who is she?
-She's her mom.

783
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,651
What? Boxing?

784
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,904
Seriously, boxing?

785
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,490
-Were you aware of this?
-No, ma'am.

786
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,367
-Were you in on it too?
-No, ma'am.

787
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,371
Mr. Jeong, don't tell me you knew as well.

788
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,873
Well…

789
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,713
What's going on?

790
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,423
Is this a gathering?

791
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,634
-Ms. Seo!
-Dan-ah!

792
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,178
-What's going on?
-Let me explain.

793
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,271
Hey, Mi-joo!

794
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,092
You, brat. Let's talk at home. Follow me.

795
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,094
-Wait.
-Ms. Seo, I'm taking a half-day.

796
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,303
-Let me go.
-Follow me!

797
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:29,557
-Ye-jun, don't forget my bag!
-Is this the only cafe in Seoul?

798
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,936
Why are you causing a scene at my cafe?

799
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,270
Why?

800
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,716
What happened to your hand?

801
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,553
I'm going to get it checked out today.

802
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,887
I think it's due to work.

803
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,142
The fireworks I bought were too big.

804
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,768
There's so much to clean up.

805
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,646
Why are you here?

806
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,314
I was invited.

807
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,234
And I owe Ms. Seo so…

808
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,031
Would you have still come
if you knew I'd be here?

809
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:03,276
Damn it. I told you not to do it.

810
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,694
This is all because of you.

811
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,237
Both of you, quiet.

812
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,574
I wasn't loud.

813
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,326
You have a loud voice to begin with.

814
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,244
I feel like an outcast.

815
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,163
You guys are too harsh.

816
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,665
Make sure you clean everything up.

817
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,168
And stop causing a mess
at someone else's workplace.

818
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,843
By the way,

819
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,096
how are you two related?

820
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,931
Your name wasn't on the family tree.

821
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,059
I'm a bastard.

822
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,023
A bastard?

823
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,611
This is a secret,
so keep it on the down-low.

824
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,821
What?

825
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,281
Okay.

826
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,830
And

827
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,958
today isn't her birthday.

828
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,877
It's fake. She wasn't born today.

829
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,005
She was born before Myeong-min,

830
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:10,009
but Dad only registered her birthday
after he was born.

831
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,346
I really didn't want to tell you this,

832
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:16,057
but I did so you wouldn't ruin
her day again.

833
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,485
It won't take long.

834
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,238
Goodness. When will you clean that up?

835
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,449
-It's okay. You can go first.
-Okay.

836
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,147
Hello?

837
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,902
-Right now?
<i>-Yes.</i>

838
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,529
<i>I can't seem to reach Ms. Bang.</i>

839
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,909
She probably has bad reception.

840
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,955
Okay.

841
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,046
Why are you doing such a poor job?

842
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,298
How are we to trust her with our kids?

843
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,382
I'm truly sorry.

844
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,467
What's going on?

845
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,221
Sir, Su-bin got in a fight
with another student.

846
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,433
-He's here instead of her--
-Are you educating them properly?

847
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,185
Where are her parents?

848
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,978
He's that athlete.

849
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,897
Are you him?

850
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,316
You were in charge of them
before the scandal.

851
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:52,320
We've filed in our complaints.
I refuse to let you train my son.

852
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,656
He has no right to train anyone.

853
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,867
Forget it. Where's the coach?
I want to see her right now.

854
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,996
I'm struggling to manage everything.

855
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,961
I'm sorry.
It's all because I'm a lousy adviser.

856
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,087
Don't say that.

857
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,757
Is Su-bin in class?

858
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,094
She's not here.

859
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,846
She's been suspended starting today.

860
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,684
The victim's mother demands
an apology from her parents.

861
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,395
But Su-bin… You know her story.

862
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,438
We shouldn't be apologetic

863
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,482
after only hearing one side of the story.

864
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,529
If she's still at fault
after hearing her side of the story,

865
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,114
then I'll apologize to them.

866
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,787
You shouldn't drink
while taking these antibiotics.

867
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,915
Do you mean I can't drink for a week?
They gave me a week's worth.

868
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,209
Don't forget to keep your hand
bandaged when showering.

869
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,880
Are you sure I can't even have one sip?

870
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,548
You know my answer.

871
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,106
Hello. Here's the prescription.

872
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,233
Okay. One minute.

873
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,485
Okay.

874
01:00:58,196 --> 01:00:59,864
Mi-joo.

875
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,784
-What?
-Hello.

876
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,702
I can't believe I ran into you here.

877
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,458
I love your fingernails.
Did you do them yourself?

878
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,876
Yes, it's my hobby.

879
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:15,505
Mi-joo, you can talk casually.

880
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,298
-Should I?
-Yes.

881
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,467
Did you go to that hospital?

882
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,720
I have inflammation in my fingers.

883
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:27,183
I fell down some stairs.

884
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,728
I'm usually good at avoiding them

885
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,438
but I couldn't that day.

886
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,525
Are you being bullied at school?

887
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,906
That student ridiculed me and said
I couldn't learn anything

888
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,616
from someone who committed assault.

889
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,413
Does Mr. Ki know about this?

890
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,585
I don't think I can lie to his face,

891
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,878
so I've been dodging him.

892
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,005
I don't want to hurt him.

893
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,304
They said the track and field team
could break up because of me.

894
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,850
How is that your fault?

895
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,309
Are you a big shot?

896
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,234
I shouldn't be laughing,

897
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,820
but that was hilarious.

898
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,280
I tend to be funny.

899
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,164
If I tell them the truth and reconcile,

900
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,500
do you think everything
will turn out well?

901
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,297
Should I tag along with you?
I have a lot of free time.

902
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,508
This is my problem.

903
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,470
If I run away…

904
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,099
-No, if I do--
-Then let's have some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

905
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,934
I know a tasty place.

906
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,771
Ms. Oh Mi-joo, Ms. Lee Su-bin.
Your medication is ready.

907
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,105
-Okay.
-Okay.

908
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:04,781
Hello.

909
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,074
I'm Lee Su-bin.

910
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,701
I have something to tell you.

911
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,537
So you're the girl.

912
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,331
Bring your parents, not you.

913
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,250
I live with my aunt.

914
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,669
And she's very busy.

915
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,338
I want to apologize.

916
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,174
And I don't deserve to be suspended.

917
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,010
You really are ignorant, aren't you?

918
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,763
Chang-seop grabbed me first,
so I tried to stop him--

919
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:32,099
Hey. How dare you blame my son?

920
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,269
Bring your aunt then.
I have no business with you.

921
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,564
This is the problem with ignorant kids.

922
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,697
Hey! Who are you?

923
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,241
Who are you? Are you crazy?

924
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,159
A bit?

925
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,953
Hey!

926
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:56,040
Are you nuts?

927
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,542
-I am.
-What?

928
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,044
I'm totally nuts,
and I don't know what I'm capable of.

929
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,505
Treat her like you just did again
if you're curious to find out.

930
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,965
Then I'll really throw this.

931
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:07,093
Who are you to meddle in our affair?

932
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,803
Me? I'm her sister.

933
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:14,016
What's the big deal about having parents?

934
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,811
Let's go eat some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

935
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,980
Su-bin!

936
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,859
Did you cry? She did this, didn't she?

937
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,318
-Let me go!
-Hey!

938
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,404
Why are you doing this?

939
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,947
Did you make her cry?

940
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,240
So?

941
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,742
Why do you want to join track and field?

942
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,077
Why would you?

943
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,371
You bad-mouthed Mr. Ki.

944
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:37,039
Let me go!

945
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,167
I did that out of jealousy

946
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,336
since you liked him so much.

947
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:46,048
Why would you be jealous?

948
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,633
Because I like you!

949
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:49,969
That's why.

950
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,264
What?

951
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,142
You idiot! You fool!

952
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,270
I told you to study.
Now you want to join the track team?

953
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,690
Don't be cruel to her.
I'm going to protect her.

954
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,693
Who are you to protect her? Come here.

955
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:08,446
Goodness, kids these days
are so passionate.

956
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,865
-Su-bin!
-Stop calling her name!

957
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,158
Let's go.

958
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:15,912
What do you think about him?

959
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,788
-Well…
-That hurts.

960
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,125
Su-bin.

961
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,794
What took you so long? Did you eat?

962
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,047
-Hello.
-Hello.

963
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,965
Who is she?

964
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,301
She's a friend. I like her.

965
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,553
-I see.
-Hello.

966
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,972
I wanted to buy her dinner.

967
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,223
Were you waiting?

968
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,725
It's okay.

969
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,269
Your track and field teacher came today
as well.

970
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,938
He waited for a long time.

971
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,482
I think he's left.

972
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:48,027
I guess he came again. It's cold today.

973
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,864
You can talk to him later.
It's a happy ending after all.

974
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:53,866
Thank you for today.

975
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,160
-Don't mention it. Go.
-Goodbye.

976
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,120
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

977
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,205
Let's go.

978
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,540
Are you okay?

979
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,556
-Seon-gyeom--
-Don't go.

980
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:04,186
I won't, so let go of this.

981
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,604
I know you will.

982
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,821
Let me go, and we'll talk.

983
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:16,449
Wait. Let's just stay like this
for a minute.

984
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:19,535
I've…

985
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,123
never been stubborn about anything.

986
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,836
So I don't know how to do it.

987
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,258
But could you not teach me?

988
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,219
Not teach you what?

989
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,476
How to break up.

990
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,568
You can teach me everything else,

991
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,825
but could you not teach me that?

992
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,750
Can you just…

993
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:14,131
like me?

994
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:22,973
Please.

995
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,688
Please, Ms. Oh.

996
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,015
Catch me if you can.

997
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,185
Do I still look like a kid to you?

998
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,396
Yes, and that's exactly why

999
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,189
I should keep you close at all times.

1000
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,525
You didn't come home last night.

1001
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,193
-Yes.
-Are you not coming home again?

1002
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:19,613
I'm so frustrated that I can't sleep.

1003
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:22,658
<i>It wouldn't be that hard
to figure out where he is.</i>

1004
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:23,868
<i>What about you?</i>

1005
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,911
-How dare you run away?
-What? Me?

1006
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:29,748
I knew she was crazy,
but not to this extent.

1007
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,916
Where should I sleep tonight?

1008
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:33,961
I'll pounce on you.

1009
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:38,048
-I miss you.
<i>-Why don't you join our agency?</i>

1010
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,383
I'd like us to work together.

1011
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,843
<i>You did a good job.</i>

1012
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,721
Then why don't you come over
for some <i>ramyeon</i>?

1013
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,390
<i>We'll have the house to ourselves.</i>

1014
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:52,771
