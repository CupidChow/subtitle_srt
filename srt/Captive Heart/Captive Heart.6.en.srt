1
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,080
Where did you get this much money?

2
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,320
Saiyud, Aon, get away!

3
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,040
I hereby summon evil spirits

4
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,760
to feast upon
your sinister soul, Muen Vorachai.

5
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
I only know that today, I have some hope

6
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,400
because of someone such as you.

7
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,200
Lady Pim. Khun Saengplarn
doesn't wish to marry you

8
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,760
because he truly loves me.

9
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,880
You have not bedded each other, have you?

10
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,440
<i>Your face reveals all.</i>

11
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,400
Luang Bovorntat is amassing arms
for the insurrection.

12
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,440
Put him in the capital prison.

13
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,120
In three days, we shall put him on trial.

14
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,760
But with how unlawful this nation is,

15
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,480
the citizens shall be harmed by the war.

16
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,480
If you believe in the law,

17
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,560
then what are the suspects

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
without evidence or witness?

19
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,280
They are the innocent, My Lord.

20
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,400
Hence,

21
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
prove to me

22
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,680
that you truly believe in the law.

23
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,960
Luang Bovorntat is amassing arms
for the insurrection.

24
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,240
You have evidence?

25
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
I think not.

26
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,760
<i>Criminal Code of the Kingdom, Section 16.</i>

27
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,920
<i>Accusing anyone without proof</i>
<i>is considered defamation.</i>

28
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,360
Luang Bovorntat, My Lord.

29
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,640
I humbly apologize for my offense.

30
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
Only words

31
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
shall not be suffice, Khun Saengplarn.

32
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,280
Please forgive me

33
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
for my transgression.

34
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,120
I shall not behave
this way again, My Lord.

35
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
See yourself out.

36
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,960
Splendid! Good!

37
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,760
Today, I shall teach you
the art of warfare.

38
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,000
Offensive, defensive,
and maneuvering tactics.

39
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
As well as the ruse

40
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,000
to deceive the enemy.

41
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
<i>I have been asking around.</i>

42
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,960
The neighboring households confirmed

43
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,760
that Khun Saengplarn
moved his belongings to the camp.

44
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,960
He and Lady Chavala shall surely separate.

45
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
They are not truly husband and wife.

46
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,560
All they did was perform an act before me.

47
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,880
Does he live in the military camp?

48
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,280
This is the map of Ayothaya. All you…

49
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,280
What are you lot looking at?

50
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,000
This is Lady Pimpilai,
the daughter of the Minister.

51
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,920
Hey.

52
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,440
All of you, stop at once!

53
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
She is a close companion
of Khun Saengplarn.

54
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
She is here to take care of him.

55
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
Do not ever be this rude!

56
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
Cease your insolence!

57
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Where are you going?

58
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,680
- Woo!
- Please stay!

59
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,960
How could it be this filthy?

60
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Out!

61
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,360
This is worn as well.

62
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
Aunt Tun.

63
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,320
From now on, I shall be
in charge of this kitchen.

64
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,880
Good.

65
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,720
I told you I would be here
to take care of you.

66
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I am fulfilling my promise.

67
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Well, I saw that you were
deeply in love with Lady Va.

68
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
Then why did you move to the camp?

69
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,080
You said that you do not wish to wed me.

70
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,240
Then so be it.

71
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,640
We shall stay and tend
to one another in this manner.

72
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
In what kind of relationship, My Lady?

73
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,120
As the people of Ayothaya would have it,

74
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
I shall be your mistress.

75
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,440
You cannot dwell in this camp, Lady Pim.

76
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,640
This environment bears no resemblance
to how you were raised.

77
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Why can I not?

78
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,760
This camp is in Ayothaya as well.

79
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
How could it be different?

80
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,520
Lady Chavala shall never be able to
prepare royal court cuisine for everyone

81
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
every day in this manner.

82
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
Let alone feasting others,

83
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,920
she can barely survive herself.

84
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,880
Aum! Aum!

85
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
Is another course ready?!

86
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,600
It shall be soon, My Lady!

87
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,760
- Make haste!
- Yes, My Lady!

88
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
What is this?!

89
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,880
Be careful, My Lady! Run!

90
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,840
My Lady! Please help!

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,880
Court cuisine

92
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,840
may be but a dream they taste
once in their lives, My Lady.

93
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,240
I shall not be able to punish them.

94
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
Va.

95
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,160
Pray tell.

96
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you and Khun Saengplarn
truly love one another?

97
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
I do love him. Laor.

98
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,440
I love him more dearly
than my real brother.

99
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,560
He truly is the brother I deserve.

100
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
I meant not such love.

101
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,840
Khun Saengplarn rushed in to help us

102
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,640
and even did unlawful acts.

103
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,520
Thus, I am thinking

104
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,320
that he has feelings for you.

105
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Laor.

106
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,840
But he always helps the citizens in need.

107
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,560
We are no different from them.

108
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,840
If he does not feel anything,
and you are only siblings,

109
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,800
you two can live separately.
He shall stay in the main house,

110
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
and you dwell in the servant quarter.

111
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,080
You barely meet each other.

112
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,880
Then why must he go
all the way to live in the camp?

113
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,080
Hey, what?

114
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,600
Go, go!

115
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,200
Normally, a highborn lady does not often
grace the public with her presence.

116
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,520
But with your decision
to reside in this camp,

117
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,240
they must long to behold you
with their own eyes.

118
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,800
I shall not be able to punish them.

119
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,800
But dear,…

120
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,160
I have much work to attend to, My Lady.

121
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Follow me this way.

122
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,240
- Bring those inside.
- Hey! Where are you taking these to?!

123
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,760
Hey! Hey!

124
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,880
- Hey!
- Those are all for your food!

125
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,120
Why are you taking them?!

126
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,240
- Hey! Return the produce at once!
- You bandits!

127
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,520
- You thieves!
- You lot!

128
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,560
Aunt Tun!

129
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,600
Did they take it all?!

130
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,320
Yes, they took all of it.
I prepared those.

131
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,560
What shall we do?!

132
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,040
We have nothing left. Not even for them!

133
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,360
- What is this?! A military camp or a den?
- Can’t they just make an honest living?!

134
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,840
Dear, is this a military camp
or a den of thieves?

135
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,000
They are gluttonous and perverted.

136
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,320
There are thieves as well!

137
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,640
These are difficult times
for the people of Ayothaya, My Lady.

138
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,640
These soldiers
must provide for their families.

139
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440
Their only choices are being thieves

140
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
or joining the military.

141
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
It is good that you are here now.

142
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
You shall then be able
to inform the noblemen

143
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,240
regarding the hardship
our citizens suffer.

144
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,840
Then, they shall cease
their corruption and negligence

145
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,240
and dedicate themselves to their duties.

146
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,920
I have had enough.
I shall reside here no more.

147
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,480
I did not condone Pim's actions.

148
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,880
Yet I know not how to stop her.

149
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,400
I do not wish to be an ungrateful student

150
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,560
who brings dishonor
to your daughter, Master.

151
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,440
Please forgive me.

152
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,640
I shall not be able

153
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,080
to marry Lady Pim.

154
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,360
Dear!

155
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,880
Dear! Dear!

156
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,120
Look what Pim is doing to us!

157
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,360
Must both of her parents

158
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,120
perish from heartbreak
before she finds satisfaction?

159
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,720
What is happening?

160
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,440
Pim has moved her belongings away, dear.

161
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,560
She is to reside at Pansaeng's home!

162
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,480
Good heavens. This girl.

163
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,600
From now on, I shall live in this room.

164
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,360
Pao, Aum,

165
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,080
you shall reside in the quarter beside.

166
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,400
Yes, My Lady.

167
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,480
Wait a moment, Lady Pim.

168
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,280
The quarter is where Laor and I live.

169
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,200
You and your people
can live in the raft house.

170
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,960
I shall need to reside here

171
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,240
to work and take care of Khun Saengplarn.

172
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,760
I hope you understand.

173
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,080
Forcing yourself into a man's house?

174
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,280
Even a prostitute would not do this.

175
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,720
What did you say?

176
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,760
I shall make you learn your place!

177
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,960
Stop right there.

178
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,200
Stop. No one shall lay hands
upon my people.

179
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,760
We shall tell Khun Saengplarn.

180
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,320
- I shall not move anywhere.
- You shall.

181
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,440
- Va.
- Laor. I wish to have a peaceful life.

182
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Listen.

183
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,600
When dogs bark or approach you,

184
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,280
you need only walk away.

185
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,800
You need not fight with those dogs.

186
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,079
You. Are you insulting me?

187
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,520
It is good that you are here.

188
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,319
I do not reside in this house, thus,
I shall no longer need to tidy it.

189
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,359
Are you sure you are not interested?

190
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,359
Then, what's in that chest,

191
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,480
I shall have it.

192
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,680
It is the royal-bestowed gift
for his marriage with Lady Chavala.

193
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,440
Your lady did wed him
solely for his money.

194
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,800
He may be blind to your deceit,

195
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,480
but I shall be here to protect his wealth.

196
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
No! This belongs to Va.

197
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,560
Laor. No. Come here.

198
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,680
I have always earned my own money.

199
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,360
There is great pleasure
in using the money I have earned myself.

200
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
Yet if one never earns their own wealth,

201
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,320
relying solely on their parents'

202
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,760
or a man's fortune,

203
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,640
it is no wonder
they would eagerly seek it.

204
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,960
Come.

205
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,400
Why?

206
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,600
Why am I never granted
the peace others enjoy?

207
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,640
Why?

208
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,960
Dear.

209
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,360
I thought you would leave me
to be alone in this.

210
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,160
Do women think of nothing

211
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,160
apart from winning over a man?

212
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,440
What is it that you are angry about?

213
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,560
I am weary of this.

214
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,440
I am weary of how

215
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,600
I cannot get any work done.

216
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Are you reprimanding me?

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
Wipe your tears.

218
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,280
You shall show no weakness to them.

219
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,480
Come with me.

220
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,920
Where are we going?

221
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Come, Tian.

222
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,200
They are all beautiful, My Lady.

223
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,640
These clothes are fine as well.

224
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
They are in various colors.

225
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,880
- Look.
- Gorgeous.

226
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
Lady Pim.

227
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,760
Dear, I seek your permission
to stay here and--

228
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,200
No.

229
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,960
Permission needs to be asked first.

230
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,040
But you have moved
your belongings in here.

231
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
Are you reprimanding me?

232
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,160
We have studied together.

233
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,240
Only us two
have attained the perfect score.

234
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,280
You are the wisest woman I know.

235
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
But when love blinds you,

236
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,400
your wisdom diminishes.

237
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,200
As Master has said.

238
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,840
You. You made him angry with me.

239
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,560
Laor! Tian!

240
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir?

241
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,960
Put everything back in the chest.

242
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,040
Yes, sir. We shall take
Lady Va's belongings back, My Lady.

243
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
This belongs to Lady Va.

244
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Should you want this house,
you shall have it.

245
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,240
But the chest of royal-bestowed
marriage gifts has been given to Va.

246
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
But Lady Va does not appreciate
being wed to you.

247
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,280
She did wed you

248
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,080
only to leech off your wealth.

249
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
He cares not only for me,

250
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
but for my servants as well.

251
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
Is it true, dear?

252
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes.

253
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,200
I shall give all to her.

254
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,280
- Oh, I shall give all to her.
- Oh, I shall give all to her.

255
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,640
‪This if fair and just, Lady Pim.

256
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,280
I gave it all to her.

257
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,880
If you take it,

258
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,520
you shall be a thief.

259
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,880
Come.

260
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Dear.

261
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,000
Where are you going?

262
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,640
Do you not wish to wash your face
once you are home?

263
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,880
Dear!

264
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,280
What is this, My Lady?

265
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,240
Did you not say that
he does not love Lady Chavala?

266
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,960
Surely, he must be deceived.

267
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,120
I shall help him.

268
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
Pao.

269
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
Aum. We need to help him.

270
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,360
- Yes, My Lady.
- Yes, My Lady.

271
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,960
Be careful on here.

272
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,360
Oh.

273
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,440
Please be careful.

274
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,680
It is all ruined.

275
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,600
You have given her the house,

276
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,480
and this raft house is but worn and weary.

277
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,440
Where shall we stay now?

278
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,840
Sir.

279
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
I need bamboo poles.

280
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,760
I shall bring Aon to see it mended.

281
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
- Is it a good plan?
- Yes, my Lady.

282
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,360
The good-looking servant?

283
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,880
Yes.

284
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,920
Then there is no need.

285
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,200
Here we come! The help is here!

286
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,160
We are upon you!

287
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,200
<i>Mong, Mong ,Teng, Mong.</i>

288
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
<i>Mong, Mong ,Teng, Mong.</i>

289
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
- <i>Teng, Mong.</i> Woo!
- Harn,

290
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,400
do not fall into the water!

291
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
I know!

292
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
<i>Teng, Mong, Teng, Mong, Teng, Mon.</i>

293
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,800
Woo!

294
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
Dear.

295
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,840
Are you this serious, dear?

296
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,200
I am serious

297
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,920
because I shall come live here as well.

298
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,760
Khun Phra!

299
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,680
- He is Khun!
- I know!

300
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,400
Here. We have two raft houses.

301
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,120
Khun Saengplarn shall take this one,
and Lady Va shall take another.

302
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
shall have separate houses.

303
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
- That is right.
- Fine.

304
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,400
- Laor!
- Yes, sir?

305
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,320
You shall live in that one, and I

306
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
shall share one with Lady Va.

307
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,680
- What?
- Khun Phra!

308
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,840
- I told you he is Khun!
- Yes.

309
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,160
I know!

310
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
Did you hear it?

311
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,320
- Yes, it was my foot.
- No!

312
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,200
He said he shall be with…

313
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
Will it be all right?

314
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,640
Why?

315
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,440
Hey! Where are any of you?!

316
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,280
Where is my palm wine?!

317
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,560
Aon!

318
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,720
It is here, sir. I am here.

319
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Aon.

320
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
I called for you with all my might.

321
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,320
Are you playing with me?

322
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,680
Do you wish to stop serving me?

323
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
- No, sir.
- I shall kill you.

324
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,680
The buffalo hide.

325
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,600
Pansaeng! What did you do to me?!

326
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,880
The magic of Khun Saengplarn.

327
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,280
It is truly effective.

328
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,560
Ming. Look.

329
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
It is with me.

330
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,200
Bua is truly a strict wife.

331
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,000
Even in his work,

332
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
she is bound to follow him.

333
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
Hey.

334
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,960
She is here to cook for us.

335
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,520
The kitchen was taken, was it not?

336
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,920
Oh, Ming.

337
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,800
My wife, Wat, wishes
to introduce a woman to you.

338
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,560
Are you interested?

339
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,800
No, Sak.

340
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,240
I long to live as freely as Yong.

341
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,040
Ming!

342
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
Living by yourself is lonely.

343
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,320
Take a wife. Trust me.

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
Without a wife, you shall have no home,

345
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,040
no children, and no money
to care for your parents.

346
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,880
You would live
a wasteful life till the day you die.

347
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,720
Do not heed his words.
We must learn from Khun Saengplarn.

348
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,280
Without a wife, he remains focused.

349
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,560
Look.

350
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,240
Are you sure, Yong?

351
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,680
It looks good on you.

352
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,280
This color?

353
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,720
Yes.

354
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,960
Can he not dress himself?

355
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,400
I suppose

356
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,520
he shall take my side tonight.

357
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,840
True that.

358
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,600
They talk with passion,
akin to that of life partners.

359
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,960
Unlike speaking with those service women

360
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,400
who use only sweet words
to take your money.

361
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,880
- What?
- Men such as us

362
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,840
cannot survive without a good woman.

363
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,440
- As a child, we need a mother.
- Yes.

364
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,720
- As a man, we need a wife.
- Yes.

365
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,840
That way, our lives shall have goals.

366
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
- Is that true?!
- Yes.

367
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,840
No!

368
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Yes, not true!

369
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,560
See for yourself.

370
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
- I do not know.
- What?

371
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
And what of this one?

372
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,640
You must try it.

373
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,000
This shall not make me
look like a street performer.

374
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,960
What would you look like then?

375
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
Go and ask him.

376
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,120
Fine.

377
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
We shall have an answer today.

378
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,120
Sir.

379
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,640
Are you truly

380
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,600
to share a room
with Lady Chavala in the raft house?

381
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,120
But you told us

382
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,080
that lying with women
would cause your magic to fade.

383
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,480
And you said it might prove fatal.

384
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,600
Right, sir!

385
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,600
Could you truly bed a woman?

386
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,360
Lady Pim moved into my home

387
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,240
to pressure me.

388
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,120
I must do everything
to compel her to leave.

389
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,600
Is all of this the plan
to make Lady Pim leave, sir?

390
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,760
But that raft house

391
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
is quite small, sir.

392
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,960
Shall you and Lady Chavala
be able to sleep there?

393
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,600
I have talked with Va.

394
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,760
We shall live together

395
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,320
as siblings.

396
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,560
Siblings?

397
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,640
- Siblings!
- Siblings.

398
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
Yes, sir.

399
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,000
And those bamboo flowers…
What do you need them for, sir?

400
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,040
I…

401
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
This concerns you not.
Return to your duties.

402
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,280
What are they for?

403
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,600
It is said that

404
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,520
Khun Saengplarn and Lady Chavala
have not shared a bed.

405
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,760
Oh? Why?

406
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,520
Was it not said that
they lay together in the woods?

407
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
Harn said it was a misunderstanding.

408
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
Regardless, they appear to be

409
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,800
a good match, much like
Enau and Busaba, do they not?

410
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,320
Lady Chavala

411
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,080
no longer has her mother.
Perhaps no one has prepared her for it.

412
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,440
We must teach her something.

413
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,280
Bua. Wat. Do you need my help?

414
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
Well,

415
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,760
you can help us
pick some sweet leaves, My Lady.

416
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,920
Yes.

417
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,040
Bua…

418
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,880
Lady Chavala.

419
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,080
We both hold Khun Saengplarn
in great esteem and affection.

420
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,760
Please do not take offense
to what we are to disclose to you.

421
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,440
What is it, Bua?

422
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,680
Yong and Ming often frequent the brothel.

423
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,960
I fear that Harn, my husband,
may follow in their footsteps.

424
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
And my husband is Sak, My Lady.

425
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,200
He resides in this camp as well.
We both feared that

426
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,200
our husbands would take favor
with service women.

427
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,480
So, we visited a certain person together.

428
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,720
Whom did you visit?

429
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,960
We went to Chuen,
the brothel keeper, My Lady.

430
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,160
We asked her to teach us
how to please our husbands.

431
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
Oh.

432
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,400
You must learn how to please your husband

433
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,720
as they do as well.

434
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,440
Bua, I…

435
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,200
You are still youthful and full of vigor.

436
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,800
It shall be exciting, My Lady.

437
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,160
- Boiled egg salad with pickled garlic.
- Yes.

438
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,400
Please have plenty. All of them are tasty.

439
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,080
Garlic. Coriander. Banana.

440
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Forget not these ingredients.

441
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,880
Late at night,
you two shall become lively!

442
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,800
Dear, do you know?

443
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,680
This food shall help us

444
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,680
be excited tonight.

445
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,120
Excited?

446
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
What did she mean by excited?

447
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,600
It is getting dark.

448
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,159
I am here to invite you inside, dear.

449
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,199
Va.

450
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,960
- Yes?
- You must try this.

451
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,320
Spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic.

452
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,239
Yes.

453
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,880
Are you not going inside, dear?

454
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,440
I had Tian
move my belongings here, My Lady.

455
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,719
I shall sleep in this raft house.

456
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,840
You have already moved?

457
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,480
Then my reputation is crushed.

458
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,440
I cannot wed anyone else now.

459
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,000
That is correct, My Lady.

460
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,000
It is wise to return
to your father's house.

461
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
It is not too late.

462
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,719
I am at my wit's end.

463
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,960
I cannot flee.

464
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
And I shall not be leaving this house.

465
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,719
She's not leaving…

466
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,480
And what I enjoy most

467
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,960
is bathing at night.

468
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,120
Oh, the weather is fitting.

469
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
It is cold,

470
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,640
and we would scrub, rinse,

471
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,080
and play with one another.

472
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,880
And you must be gentle.

473
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,120
Take it nice and slow.

474
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,520
The coldness will vanish
with a warm embrace, My Lady.

475
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,280
Yes!

476
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,800
Dear.

477
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,080
Tonight,

478
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
shall we take a bath together?

479
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,520
I most enjoy it.

480
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,440
We shall bathe in cold water,

481
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,120
then scrub, rinse,

482
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,120
and play with each other.

483
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,040
Please take a bath with me, dear.

484
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Dear!

485
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,280
Yes, My Lady.

486
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,680
Lady Pim. Did you hear that he

487
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,040
shall sleep here tonight?

488
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,640
The raft house is renovated as well.
Look how beautiful it is.

489
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,800
Is it, dear?

490
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes. It is right, My Lady.

491
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,560
I shall reside in this raft house

492
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,600
from tonight on.

493
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,040
Did you settle
on moving to the raft house?

494
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,920
The main house shall be mine?

495
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
Fine.

496
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,600
The three of us
shall live on in this manner.

497
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,920
You may grow old
and pass on the raft house.

498
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,200
I shall not go anywhere.

499
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,120
Lady Pim was shaken with anger.

500
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,280
Surely, she shall return home tomorrow.

501
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,120
How could you say those words?
You are a lady!

502
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Bua and Wat taught me.

503
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,480
And you listened?!

504
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,400
They were so enthusiastic.

505
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,360
Dear, there is more.

506
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,560
They said that

507
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
- when couples bathe together,
- No. No.

508
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,360
- they must be on each other and put…
- No, I shall listen no more.

509
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,880
You are such a mischievous young lady!

510
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,040
You had plenty, dear.

511
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
<i>I gave this magic to you.</i>

512
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Protect it with your life.

513
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,720
If one day you are consumed by lust

514
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,000
and let yourself be entangled with women,

515
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,280
may every bone in your body

516
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,040
shatter. May your every muscle

517
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,040
burn like fire.

518
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,040
May your spirit be torn

519
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,720
and descend into hellfire.

520
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,440
It has begun.

521
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,440
Whenever you are consumed by lust,

522
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,240
you must place
bamboo flowers in your mouth,

523
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,720
for the thorns piercing your tongue

524
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
shall keep you composed.

525
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,520
In the presence of women,

526
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,480
you shall survive.

527
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,640
Yes, Master.

528
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,320
Dear?

529
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,120
Dear.

530
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,280
You are here?

531
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,200
I thought you were outside.

532
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,520
My apologies.

533
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
I only just stayed here.

534
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,600
Yes.

535
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,000
What are they doing? I cannot see.

536
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,520
Being inside together all evening

537
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,880
is indeed strange.

538
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,720
Did you not claim
they hold no love for one another,

539
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,360
nor do they lie together?

540
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,600
Pao, why must you ask me?

541
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,160
How long must we sit in this manner?

542
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,920
You like to play this?

543
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,440
Yes.

544
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,160
You are impressive.

545
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,160
My sister

546
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,560
most enjoyed this game.

547
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
She taught me how to play.

548
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,360
You are the kindest.

549
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,760
I tried to get my brother
to play it with me,

550
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,920
but he always refused.

551
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,000
Then,

552
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
we shall compete.

553
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,080
- Really?
- Yes!

554
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,640
All right.

555
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,960
Do not use any tricks or your magic.

556
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,240
I shall use no tricks, possibly.

557
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,200
- You may begin.
- Very well.

558
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,280
Blast it.

559
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,960
Why is the raft house shaking this much?

560
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,560
Dear! You must bounce harder!

561
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,840
- What a disgrace!
- Keep bouncing.

562
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,080
Harder?

563
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,920
- Harder.
- Shall we look closer?

564
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,840
Harder!

565
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,400
Do not lose your strength yet!

566
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,800
Even harder! Harder!

567
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,720
- I shall help you!
- Come!

568
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,960
If the raft house shakes this much,
they must not be pretending.

569
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,080
Harder!

570
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,480
More! I shall help you!

571
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,880
Dear! Dear. It is in.

572
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,520
- Is it in?
- It is.

573
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,160
It is inside. It is there.

574
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,160
I can take this no longer.

575
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,680
Shameless!

576
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,000
You show no respect
for house spirits at all.

577
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,920
My Lady! Please wait!

578
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,440
That jutting floorboard
proved most troublesome to adjust.

579
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,520
I think I must take a bath again.

580
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,520
My Lady.

581
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,640
My Lady.

582
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,480
My Lady! Stop!

583
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,760
My Lady! Please stop!

584
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,600
Those are all nice pots. Lady Pim.

585
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,480
Wait.

586
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,160
Dear, let go of me.

587
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,320
Where are you going? You must not go.

588
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,360
- Why? She--
- Listen to me.

589
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,640
We must accept small defeats

590
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,000
to achieve a great victory.

591
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,240
Fine.

592
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,240
I hereby cast this curse

593
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,800
upon you and him,

594
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,160
that one day,
you shall both suffer in love as I do!

595
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,160
It is all quiet now.

596
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,480
Can love truly

597
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,760
blind one so utterly?

598
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,920
That is not what I believe.

599
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,240
Love is power.

600
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,680
Look at yourself.

601
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,600
Your love for the people

602
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,000
grants you power.

603
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,920
I love the people

604
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,280
and justice so deeply

605
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,920
that I cannot love any woman.

606
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,440
You have refused

607
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,640
to be with Lady Pim

608
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,200
or me.

609
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,240
What truly is the reason?

610
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,480
Rest well.

611
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,240
My Lady. My Lady. My Lady!

612
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
What is it?

613
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,920
Please help Muen Vorachai!

614
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,080
He has a high fever and is lying at home,
moaning in pain.

615
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,360
What did happen to Chai?

616
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,160
He was angry and kicked Aon only once.
Now, he stays awake from a stomachache.

617
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,080
Really?

618
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,640
I have cut ties with Chai.

619
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,200
He is suffering the karma
from his actions toward others.

620
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,680
He shall pay for it himself.

621
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,920
Oh, My Lady.

622
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,080
You only have one brother.

623
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,720
Shall you not mourn if Muen Vorachai dies?

624
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,200
My Lady.

625
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,480
What is the commotion?

626
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,720
Please forgive me, sir! I yield!

627
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,800
- Ngiam! Ngiam, wait!
- Please forgive me!

628
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,120
Please forgive me!

629
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,280
Ngiam must come to ask you

630
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,040
to remove your curse from Chai.

631
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,600
And do you wish…

632
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,960
for me to remove it?

633
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,200
No.

634
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,160
Do not remove it.

635
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,160
It is said and done.

636
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,840
Hand me one.

637
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,160
You have been unsettled
since word of your brother reached you.

638
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,920
You are worried for him.

639
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,880
That is not what I think about.

640
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,920
Is it not?

641
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,760
Now I have a new brother,

642
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,960
and the very best of them all.

643
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,160
He is good at jackstones as well.

644
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,520
Why must I concern myself with Chai?

645
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,960
Dear.

646
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,160
What truly is love?

647
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,440
It pains me to be near him,

648
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,280
and when I am afar,

649
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,640
I am tormented by thoughts of him.

650
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,560
If you wish to return

651
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,240
to Muen Vorachai, you can do so.

652
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,240
Take the medicinal herbs, the normal ones.

653
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,000
If he abstains from such abuses,

654
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,680
he shall recover in but a few days.

655
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,920
- But shall the magic fade away?
- No.

656
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,120
For those who bring harm upon others,

657
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,040
both the curse and the karma
shall make them pay dearly.

658
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,840
Your brother

659
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,880
has committed countless sins.

660
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,280
I only think that

661
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,120
my parents were long passed.

662
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,680
My brother is the only family remaining.

663
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,480
It must be a lonely existence

664
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,280
if none remain.

665
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,120
It would be incredibly lonely.

666
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,800
Go.

667
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,920
Return to your brother.

668
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,560
Before you go,

669
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,280
hand me those nipa thatches.

670
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,120
Yes.

671
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,280
I shall go now.

672
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,600
- Laor?
- Yes?

673
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,920
Is Va here?

674
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,240
Why are you here?

675
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,840
Leave at once. Go!

676
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,280
Do not act innocent.

677
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,160
I have matched you with a man

678
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,760
so that you may help me

679
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,320
achieve higher ranks!

680
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,280
But you took his side.

681
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,280
You brought your husband here to kill me!

682
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,280
You were the one who tried to kill me!

683
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,440
Father. Mother.

684
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,480
I am nearing the end of my days.

685
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,600
I shall die in solitude,

686
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,320
with none to mourn me.

687
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,640
You keep blaming others.

688
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,560
Have you ever thought of what
you did to the servants and me?

689
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,120
Father, Mother, are you at peace

690
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,480
with my only sister

691
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,360
bringing her husband to end my life?

692
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,280
What wrong have I done?

693
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,440
All the servants and wealth belong to me.

694
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,840
Your words are most vile and distorted.

695
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,600
You claimed that you have been harmed

696
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,280
when you constantly hurt others.
How could you say that, Chai?!

697
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,080
How could you say that?!

698
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,560
Va…

699
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,600
has always tried to win
against me since childhood.

700
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,680
She resents her fate

701
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,720
of being born as a female.

702
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,320
She tried to pamper the servants

703
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,560
because she knows that the law

704
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,200
gives the rights
of the servants and wealth

705
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,840
to the eldest son.

706
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
I am near my death.

707
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,480
Are you satisfied?

708
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Are you satisfied?

709
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,160
Are you satisfied?!

710
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,040
Are you satisfied?!

711
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,640
Your thoughts

712
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,400
only carry your own sufferings.

713
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,640
No one else is in it.

714
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,760
Va! Va!

715
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,000
- What?
- A vile soul, blind to their own vices,

716
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,440
is beyond redemption, is it not?

717
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,080
Why must I bear witness to this?

718
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,160
My Lady!

719
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,680
Shall we go home, My Lady?

720
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,560
Here.

721
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,640
Ginger tea.

722
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,440
I boiled it myself.

723
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,680
It shall heal your heart wounds.

724
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,600
I shall not be weakened by a woman.

725
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,000
No.

726
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:19,880
Die!

727
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,400
I shall tell of every wound
they have endured.

728
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,320
Are you asking that
a manservant reside in my home?

729
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,320
Khun Saengplarn seems

730
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,880
not to be drawn to women.

731
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,160
Who cast this magic upon you?

732
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,040
<i>Their craft is most uncommon.</i>

733
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,760
Saenkam. You are much more skilled.

734
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,600
You are worthy of greatness
alongside Taen Seenil.
