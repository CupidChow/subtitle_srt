1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,640
Everything a wife is supposed to do,

2
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,000
I shall do it, and I shall do it well.

3
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,800
Is that all a wife should do?

4
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
Chavala prevented me
from ascending to the rank of Khun.

5
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,360
- A ghost!
- I'm a servant taking care of this house.

6
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,960
You slimy creep!
You crusty toenail! You fool!

7
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,680
Did you know that
I couldn't sleep for four nights?!

8
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,320
I kept getting spooked by noises!

9
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,480
I can't live happily because of you!

10
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,200
That necklace
was always around my father's neck.

11
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,720
How am I supposed to face
my parents when I die?

12
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Can you see now that they're important?

13
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
You can cause others pain without remorse.

14
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,480
You are really high-born,
but nothing else is high about you.

15
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED
WE SHALL HOLD THE POWER OF THIS NATION

16
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Look at what they did, sir.

17
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,360
They even cut off a child's head.

18
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
Sir.

19
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
Those who killed
and disemboweled people like this

20
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,320
are monstrously cruel!

21
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,440
They killed my husband!

22
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
They violated my daughter!

23
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,200
You could've just taken what you wanted.
Why did you have to do any of this?

24
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,640
Prai is a monster, not human anymore.

25
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,960
Luang Bovorntat, sir. A huntsman told me

26
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
there's a group of people in the woods

27
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
not far from here. They've set up a camp.

28
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,920
I'm suspecting it's Prai's people.

29
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,040
I shall take a look.

30
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,400
You want this?

31
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,080
We might be outnumbered,

32
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,000
but with skill,
victory shall not be difficult.

33
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,640
They are on break.

34
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
It's the right time

35
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
to strike.

36
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,840
It's important
to strike fast with full force.

37
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
The faster our strike,

38
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,040
the less harm we shall endure.

39
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
Ready?

40
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Once I give my signal,

41
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,320
we shall strike all at once, My Lord.

42
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Hm.

43
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,400
- Get all of them!
- Hey!

44
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Come here!

45
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Damn it, Yong!

46
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,520
No one comes to our aid!

47
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
They betrayed us!

48
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
Compose yourselves!

49
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,240
Survive this!

50
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,880
This is an order!

51
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
Yes, sir!

52
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,640
Where is Prai?!

53
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,120
I am here!

54
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
Prai?

55
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,280
Die!

56
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Their blade masteries are well matched.

57
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,120
The rumor that Pansaeng and Prai
once were under the same master

58
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
seems to be true.

59
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Brother. Let's talk first.

60
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
I'm not your brother.

61
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,880
Everyone calls you the sorcerer

62
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,039
because they don't know me.

63
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,120
Now, I…

64
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,200
shall make the world realize

65
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,039
that it's me who is the great sorcerer!

66
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,480
Come here!

67
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
Oh.

68
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,640
Laor. Why is the shrine all dusty?

69
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm afraid, My Lady.

70
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,240
I couldn't bring myself
to clean this room.

71
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,000
There's nothing in here. Come.

72
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,840
Here. Khun Saengplarn
said these are just toys.

73
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,920
Hm.

74
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
You shall die today!

75
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't be afraid.

76
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
- What?!
- Va!

77
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,400
Laor! Laor!

78
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
Our fates shall not be decided this day.

79
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,560
Prai.

80
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,400
- Laor.
- Yes?

81
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,440
Khun Saengplarn is now fighting off
thieves. Would he be all right?

82
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,800
Va! How did it come back?!

83
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm scared, Va.

84
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,600
There. You traitor.

85
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
You fled the battlefield.

86
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,800
You let
your fellow soldiers go into battle

87
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,760
while you and your men just watched!

88
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,520
Yet you dare call yourself human?

89
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,560
What do you think you're doing?

90
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,040
Luang Bovorntat is the heir
to the governor of Chiang Rung.

91
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,640
He is royalty!

92
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,840
Know your place, peasant!

93
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
You think you're so high and mighty.

94
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,360
But mind your actions for once.

95
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,680
You wish to have it all,

96
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,080
but never give anything.

97
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,880
Hence, you need not
call yourself a highborn.

98
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,920
You and Prai

99
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,960
trained in the same monastery,

100
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,960
under the same master. I don't trust you.

101
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,320
So, I decided not to join you.
Got a problem with that?

102
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
- You…
- Stop!

103
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Sir. Sir.

104
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
- Sir.
- Sir!

105
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,840
What's the matter, sir?!

106
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,880
Yong. I shall get the physician.
Join me at the camp!

107
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
Sir. Sir.

108
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
Hang in there, sir.

109
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,200
Yong, let's go. Let's go, sir.

110
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,640
Let's go, sir.

111
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,040
I thought you were invincible.

112
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
How is he doing?

113
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
He is safe, My Lady.

114
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
The physician treated his wound.

115
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,680
We shall leave him
under your care, My Lady.

116
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Was Prai that powerful?

117
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,560
If Khun Saengplarn couldn't defeat him,

118
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
no one could, My Lady.

119
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,880
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED
WE SHALL HOLD THE POWER OF THIS NATION

120
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
"All Master Prai's disciples, be prepared.

121
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,520
We shall hold the power of this nation."

122
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,840
It seems that Prai is rallying his forces.

123
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,800
Prai had his own monastery
with countless disciples.

124
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
Those who wished to have magic

125
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,120
to use in their fights with enemies

126
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,840
eventually became thieves like Prai.

127
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
I wonder what he's gathering them for.

128
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,560
They would do nothing
but rob and incite chaos.

129
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Ayothaya shall soon

130
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,280
face a time of turmoil.

131
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,600
No. Help me.

132
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,280
Die!

133
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,040
Go!

134
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
Ugh!

135
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,680
No! No!

136
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,840
- Come here!
- Let go!

137
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
Dear!

138
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,960
Mother!

139
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
Come here!

140
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
No!

141
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,880
Stop! Come here!

142
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,240
You, search that house!
Take everything you can!

143
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,520
Don't hurt Phueng! Don't hurt Phueng!

144
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Help!

145
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,760
Don't hurt Phueng!

146
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,160
Don't!

147
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,640
Help! Anyone, please help!

148
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,760
Help me!

149
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
Anyone! Help!

150
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,680
Don't. No.

151
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,280
Don't hurt Phueng. Don't hurt Phueng.

152
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,599
No. Help.

153
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,280
Don't.

154
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,599
Anyone, please help me.

155
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
Anyone, help.

156
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,240
Phueng! Don't hurt Phueng!

157
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,800
No! Don't hurt Phueng! No!

158
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,760
- Sir. Sir.
- Help me!

159
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,080
- Sir. Sir.
- No, Phueng!

160
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,800
- Sir.
- No! No!

161
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,360
Anyone!

162
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
Sir.

163
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,240
You are fine, sir. You are all right.

164
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,560
Phueng.

165
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
You are all right.

166
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,280
I couldn't fight them.

167
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
It is but a nightmare.

168
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,400
It is only in your dream, sir.

169
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
What?

170
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
Why are you here?

171
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,840
Were you asleep and didn't know
anything all this time?

172
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,280
Why?

173
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,560
You…

174
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,160
It was nothing.

175
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,840
Well, please continue your sleep.

176
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,720
You can stay.

177
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,480
I shall cool you down with a cloth.

178
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,920
The food is ready, My Lady.

179
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,280
The food is here. You should have some,
and I shall give you medicine, sir.

180
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
And where is Tian?

181
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,680
He just went to sleep, sir. He was up
all night making herbal medicine.

182
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,600
Sir. You are unwell now.

183
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,040
If we meant to kill you,
you'd already be dead by now.

184
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,040
- Please excuse me, My Lady.
- Yes.

185
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,120
Have some, sir.

186
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,880
Dear! Are you all right?!

187
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
My apologies.

188
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,080
I meant to come to inform you,
but Lady Pim wouldn't listen.

189
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Lady Pim has been close to him
since before you were even born.

190
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
I heard that you are unwell.

191
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,440
I was frightened.

192
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,040
Lady Chavala, please move aside.

193
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,760
I have brought a Western physician.

194
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,640
My dear.

195
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,800
My condition is not severe now, My Lady.

196
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,440
You shouldn't have to

197
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,760
burden yourself with all this.

198
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,720
You can leave if you want.

199
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,640
I shall take care of him today.

200
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,240
Yes, My Lady.

201
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,640
Then, please excuse me.

202
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,760
She isn't even his wife,
yet she thinks she can do this.

203
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,680
She is out of line, Va.

204
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,440
It's fine, Laor.
We now have time to relax.

205
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,160
Come.

206
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,080
It hurts.

207
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,000
Here.

208
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,760
Ouch! It hurts.

209
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,480
Hey.

210
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,160
Go rinse these rambutans.

211
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,720
Are you talking to me?

212
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,040
Obviously.

213
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,400
What kind of kitchen is this?
There's nothing in here.

214
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,480
The daughter of Praya who fell from grace?

215
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Ugh. Do it yourself then.

216
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,880
I shall be falling from grace
somewhere else.

217
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,360
Oh? What an arrogant servant.
Where are you going?

218
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,560
You must be oppressed all your life.

219
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,760
But you need not do
what you've been done to.

220
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,920
You should try using kind words,

221
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,400
and maybe
your painful life shall be better.

222
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I am doing well.

223
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,240
Oh. A fly doesn't realize

224
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,600
that it's in a pile of dung.

225
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,080
Those with peaceful minds
share their kindness with others.

226
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,560
They would say polite words
and ask for favors nicely.

227
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,240
With that, anyone would gladly help.

228
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,480
I don't understand
what you're saying, but I know

229
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,840
that you've insulted me,
you lowly servant.

230
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,520
- Well?
- You wicked child!

231
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,760
You shall die today!

232
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Come here.

233
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,360
- You're done.
- Let go of me!

234
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,480
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?!

235
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,120
Stop it. Stop!

236
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,600
I shall get you one day!

237
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,560
The day you were married,

238
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
things were really out of hand.

239
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,800
Pim was heartbroken.

240
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,720
She has been crying every day.

241
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,920
She refused to eat or sleep.

242
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,760
Lately, she wouldn't even drink water.

243
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,360
If you hurt your father
and mother this way,

244
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,200
I shall get this one man for you.

245
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,440
Dear, Pansaeng is already married.
If Pim becomes his second wife,

246
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,960
it would bring shame to all of us.

247
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,040
I shall discuss with his wife,
if she is fine with this.

248
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,240
I love Pansaeng.

249
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I can take it.

250
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
I shall be his wife,
even if there's one before me.

251
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,160
Pim!

252
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,800
Did Lady speak that way, My Lord?

253
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,960
Yes. She is willing.

254
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,640
My wife and I are also willing.

255
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,040
I shall leave it to you, Pansaeng.

256
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,080
Think it through.

257
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,400
Discuss it with your wife.

258
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,520
The physician gave me the medicine.

259
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,760
I shall come to this house

260
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,360
and take care of you every day.

261
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,200
You shouldn't, My Lady.

262
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,280
People would criticize you.

263
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,200
Everyone in the city knew

264
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,080
that Father allowed me to be with you.

265
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
My Lady.

266
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,160
I told you

267
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,360
I could not let you go.

268
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,480
My Lady.

269
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,000
Why would you confine
the love in your heart?

270
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,160
Please let it go.

271
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,240
You must set your heart free, My Lady.

272
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,000
If I let it go,

273
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,040
my heart would be empty.

274
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
A heart without love

275
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,320
is like a life without strength

276
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,000
to even breathe.

277
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
I want to be by your side, dear.

278
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,440
I shall not be anywhere else but here.

279
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,840
Please understand me.

280
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,760
Have mercy on me.

281
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,760
And give Father your word
that we shall be married.

282
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,720
Lady Pim.

283
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,600
Please.

284
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,880
Forgive my intrusion.

285
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
It's all right, My Lord.

286
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,520
We are talking about the wedding here.

287
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,600
Wedding?

288
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,160
You meant another wedding?

289
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,000
Yes, My Lord.

290
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
Please have a seat, My Lord.

291
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,880
I shall get to the kitchen.

292
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,680
May I invite you to eat with us, My Lord?

293
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yes.

294
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,880
The wedding hasn't happened, My Lord.

295
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,920
So, the talk about how Jaokhun Kaew

296
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,440
allowed Lady Pim to be with you

297
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,920
seems to be the truth.

298
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
They're all talking about it now?

299
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,240
- Oh.
- Lady Pim is a determined woman.

300
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,680
If the two of you are to be wed,

301
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,480
I believe much good will come of it.

302
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,960
- Good, My Lord?
- Hm.

303
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Jaokhun Kaewkarop is of ancient
and distinguished heritage.

304
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,920
Every noble family respects him.

305
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,440
If you become his in-law,
you shall surely rise

306
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,320
to the rank of Grand Chancellor one day.

307
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,920
Ooh.

308
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
My thanks to you, My Lord.

309
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,360
I shall drink happily tonight.

310
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,600
You kept drinking,
but didn't have any progress.

311
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,840
Your sister has been married
to Pansaeng for a month,

312
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,200
and you still couldn't get him.

313
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,800
Hey. The other day,

314
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,720
Pansaeng was slashed by Prai's blade.
He is now badly injured.

315
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
Take this opportunity. Do something.

316
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes, My Lord. Once I got rid of Pansaeng,

317
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,200
shall I be promoted right away?

318
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,440
Yes. You have my word.

319
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
Put this herb in the food for him to eat.

320
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,920
Is it a love potion or poison?

321
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,880
You…

322
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,240
Wait, brother.

323
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,600
You are my sister!

324
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,800
You choose your husband over me?

325
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,560
You are getting more violent each day.

326
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,680
Drink less and you may become more human!

327
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,200
It's you who never cares about me,

328
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,360
a man who's stuck
being a customs officer at this age.

329
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,720
Listen to me.
If our parents were still alive,

330
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
they wouldn't be upset
about you being just a Muen.

331
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,600
But they would hate you
if you planned to poison someone.

332
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,040
Father and Mother

333
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,600
had always hated me.

334
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,480
They never saw any good in me.

335
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,040
To them,

336
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,200
you were the only child
they ever had, Chavala!

337
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,159
To the battle!

338
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,639
Chai.

339
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,360
The only thing you do is play,
and you still can't read.

340
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Your sister can write a page now.

341
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,120
To hell with it.

342
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,080
Stop it.

343
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,639
Chai! I said stop!

344
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,680
Are you fascinated by this?

345
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
Yes.

346
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,840
Do you know what Dharmachakra

347
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,280
truly symbolizes?

348
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,240
I do, Father.

349
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,560
Hm?

350
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
It is the wheel of Dharma
that keeps turning.

351
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,320
In the dark days, we shall wait.

352
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,000
When the time comes,
we shall fight villainy.

353
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,800
In the end, Dharma shall prevail.

354
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,320
You really are the brightest.

355
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,000
Perhaps you've listened in

356
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,200
while I taught my students.

357
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,560
You've told them to recite it
so many times that I can remember it.

358
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,880
Hm.

359
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,040
Father.

360
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,520
I've caught a big shrimp.
Here. Did I do well?

361
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,560
From now on,

362
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
you need not eavesdrop.

363
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,640
Come in and study with them.

364
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,680
Yes.

365
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,360
What a bright girl.

366
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,960
Here, look at my shrimp, Father.

367
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,680
I've caught it by myself.

368
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,520
We shall eat this shrimp today, Father.

369
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,640
Since we were young,

370
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,040
you were loved by our grandparents.

371
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,760
Everyone was so thrilled by you
being quick-witted,

372
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
adorable, and clingy.

373
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,720
But you can't compare me to yourself.

374
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,440
You are your own person. And so am I.

375
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
But being a fun-loving child

376
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,240
in a prestigious noble family
was different.

377
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,400
They were not proud of me. But with you,

378
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,560
our kin always wished

379
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,480
you had been born a boy.

380
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,080
They've never thought
about the feeling of a boy

381
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,280
who was there in front of them!

382
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,080
No one has ever thought about me!

383
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Never ever!

384
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,800
Chai.

385
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,040
Chai.

386
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,320
Chai…

387
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,320
Your breakfast, sir.

388
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,840
I've prepared the food.

389
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,360
You can take those away.

390
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,560
Yes.

391
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,080
Wait.

392
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,840
Stay with me.

393
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,200
But I brought Kaeng thepho,

394
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,040
your favorite.

395
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,600
Hey.

396
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,000
Do you have palm seeds in syrup?

397
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,680
Sir?

398
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,480
Palm seeds in syrup.

399
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,840
I have them. I have palm seeds in syrup.

400
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,120
Can I have palm seeds in syrup?

401
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,560
Yes, sir.

402
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,760
Lady Va crafts delicious meals and sweets,
especially palm seeds in syrup.

403
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,520
Would you like to try some, Lady Pim?

404
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,120
Yes.

405
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,800
Shouldn't you be eating
your meal first, dear?

406
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,400
Here, My Lady.

407
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,480
We should thank Lady Va.

408
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,240
She sought out the finest palm seeds

409
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,440
and boiled sugar from Phetchaburi
in jasmine-infused water.

410
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,440
She went through all that for me.

411
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,160
This is the best kind of medicine.

412
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,200
A gaze can be avoided.

413
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,520
A voice can be ignored.

414
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
But a scent…

415
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,640
Before I even realized,

416
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,040
my heart had already
wandered too far into yours.

417
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,240
My cozy little soul.

418
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,840
Dear.

419
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,160
Isn't this too much?

420
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
Lady Pim.

421
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,720
I shall never forget
how you took care of me.

422
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,040
But please don't come back here again.

423
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,400
Pansaeng.

424
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,000
I owe an immense
debt of gratitude to Master Kaew.

425
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,320
I shall not let people
speak ill of his daughter.

426
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,840
You are a lady of high birth.

427
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,720
I would like you to forever
be in your high place.

428
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,680
You only fell for her

429
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,800
for this moment.

430
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,480
Before long, you'll be tired of her.

431
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,800
This woman is…

432
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,280
merely a leech

433
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,200
that is feeding off your flesh and blood.

434
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,040
In no time,
you shall realize who truly loves you.

435
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,640
My Lady. My Lady.

436
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,240
My Lady! Would you really leave?

437
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,800
Only this time.

438
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,800
You think you can win against me?

439
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,600
It shall not be easy.

440
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
- What you did…
- I was only pretending.

441
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,200
I know.

442
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,440
You've been pretending from the very
beginning, and you still keep it up.

443
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,080
It's good that you know.

444
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,280
No one is more deceitful than you.

445
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,040
You lied in front of the magistrate.
You lied about a ghost. You lied…

446
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,520
You truly are cunning.

447
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,720
I haven't lied about everything.

448
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,240
You really took care of everything well.

449
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,200
For all that, I owe you.
You truly have my thanks.

450
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,480
My cozy little soul?

451
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,440
Ew.

452
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,000
But judging from Lady Pim's face,

453
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,360
she seems quite distressed, sir.

454
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,440
If I hadn't been as harsh as I was,

455
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,800
Lady Pim wouldn't be able to forget me.

456
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,800
People say that

457
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,560
you shall take Lady Pim as a second wife.

458
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,720
No.

459
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,560
In this life, I shall take no wife.

460
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,880
Not Lady Pim, or even you.

461
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,240
My life is consumed by work.

462
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,200
I won't be able to live a family life.

463
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,280
But if you feel the need to leave,

464
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,760
then leave.

465
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,960
I am here.

466
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,800
Why are you assassinating me?

467
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,600
I hate you!

468
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,440
Does the illegal caravan belong to you?

469
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,360
Who are you working for?

470
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,000
I hate you.

471
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,960
Hey!

472
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,360
Tian! You scared me.
Where did you come from?

473
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,880
Are you healed, sir?

474
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,800
Yes.

475
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,880
Who is it?

476
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,400
Va. It's me.

477
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,200
Chai?

478
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,880
Help me, Va. Don't let Pansaeng find me.

479
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,360
What are you doing here?

480
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,040
Well, move.

481
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,120
Tian!

482
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,280
This is no time to play. Well,

483
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,960
help me find the thief.

484
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,360
Go look that way.

485
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,800
If someone resembles a thief,
call for me loudly.

486
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,240
Yes, sir.

487
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,840
A thief?

488
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,920
Are you a thief?

489
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,360
Chai, what are you doing?

490
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,840
Chai.

491
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,160
Father and Mother loved you,

492
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,680
but they never loved me.

493
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,480
And what of you? Do you love me?

494
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,440
Let's go to the kitchen. Go.

495
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,080
Go to the kitchen, brother.

496
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,200
Go.

497
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,360
Lady Va.

498
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,000
Lady Va.

499
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,240
- Lady Va.
- Yes, yes.

500
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,880
Sir! Someone ran to the canal

501
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,480
and jumped in there.

502
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,600
Wait here and be careful. Close the door.

503
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,240
Yes, sir.

504
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,800
Brother.

505
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,040
Walk along this canal,
and you shall arrive near Wat Chedi.

506
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,200
You have my thanks, sister.

507
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,600
Hurry. I shall watch out for you. Go.

508
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,520
Sir. What are you doing out here?

509
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,040
Aren't you unwell?

510
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,200
What are you looking for, sir?

511
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,520
So, it's your brother's blood.

512
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,600
He came to kill me,

513
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,480
and you saved him.

514
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,440
Had I died, you would
surely be celebrating.

515
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,680
No, sir.

516
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,960
Sir, it's not what you think--

517
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,400
I shall find a way to make him talk.

518
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,920
What would you like to know?
Is it about the caravan?

519
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,160
I shall talk him

520
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,840
- into confessing everything.
- It's futile to try.

521
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,080
From now on,

522
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,760
there shall be

523
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,120
no trust between us.

524
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,800
You were pretending
to be unwell to fool everyone,

525
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,240
including us, sir?

526
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,000
Me as well.

527
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,760
My apologies, My Lord.

528
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,480
I was so frightened, sir. That day,
I fell while running to the physician.

529
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,400
Thank goodness my head was only bruised.

530
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,120
But we saw you bleeding.

531
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,000
It was illusion magic.

532
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,240
But Prai's magic
is not to be trifled with, My Lord.

533
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,720
He left me bedridden
with a fever for days.

534
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,520
And you pretended to be unwell
in front of Luang Bovorntat

535
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,760
to fool them as well?

536
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,560
Yes, My Lord.

537
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,760
Luang Bovorntat owns that caravan.

538
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,920
But I have no evidence.

539
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,840
Is it Luang Bovorntat
who is planning an insurrection?

540
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,720
He is wealthy and powerful. He possesses
everything a man could ever desire.

541
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,960
Yet he seeks even more absolute power.

542
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,440
He presents himself as royalty.

543
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,640
He is young and holds
only the rank of Luang,

544
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,720
yet he is remarkably powerful.

545
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,040
Truly, he is a force to be reckoned with.

546
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,880
But Muen Vorachai is injured right now.

547
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,720
Shall we seize him
and extract the truth, sir?

548
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,200
Even if Muen Vorachai
mentions Luang Bovorntat,

549
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,480
he would surely deny any involvement.

550
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,680
- Ming.
- Yes, sir.

551
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,720
Tomorrow, I want you to search
for evidence at Muen Vorachai's house.

552
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,480
Find out if there are
any connections to Luang Bovorntat.

553
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,240
We made Dawei salad today, sir.
It's really tasty.

554
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,160
I shall not have it.

555
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,160
Tian!

556
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,320
Tian! Where is my food?

557
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,160
Ugh. Such a sluggish boy.

558
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,000
But you've been enjoying
the meals I prepared for days.

559
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,080
I said I don't want it.

560
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,600
Laor.

561
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,160
Take these away and bring Tian to me.

562
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,760
Yes, sir.

563
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,480
From tomorrow onwards,

564
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,200
I request your permission
to move back to my home, sir.

565
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,840
I shall reunite
with the servants in that house

566
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,440
and find a way
to start a new life somewhere.

567
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,520
Fine.

568
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,880
From now on,

569
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,120
there shall be no trust between us.

570
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,880
I want all of you
to sell the goods in the market

571
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,320
and make some money.

572
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,520
All of us will be equal to Lady Va.

573
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,320
Come, come. Gather round.
Look at this beautiful hat.

574
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,480
Are you interested? Shall you take one?

575
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,000
Aon, stop it. That's a jar.

576
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,200
Here!

577
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,000
A whetstone!

578
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,440
It almost hit my foot!

579
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Aren't you invulnerable, sir?

580
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,360
A stone wouldn't be able to hurt you.

581
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,920
Pansaeng is chasing our caravan again.

582
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,640
It's not Pansaeng down there,

583
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,080
Luang Bovorntat.

584
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,600
To deal with darkness,
we need to hone dark arts!

585
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,600
<i>You'll love my sister.</i>
<i>Your magic will fade.</i>

586
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,400
I shall stomp you.

587
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,320
