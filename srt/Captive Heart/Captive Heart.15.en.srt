1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,360
Should all go as planned, in ten days,

2
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,480
we shall lie together.

3
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,880
Terd, die!

4
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
Did you intend to kill me?

5
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
What if Luang Athikorn does not confess?

6
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
I have planned everything.

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,320
Luang Athikorn hired Terd to slit
the throat of my wife, Phin.

8
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,640
I did not kill Phin.

9
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,280
The murderer shall be
imprisoned for 20 years.

10
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,080
And if you were not a mastermind,
you shall face five years of punishment.

11
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
And Luang Athikorn shall be sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

12
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
It was not my doing, My Lord.

13
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Enough with the lies!
Noi, who has been killed,

14
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
was holding this watch in her hand!

15
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,520
The person who wishes to kill Pansaeng

16
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
is Luang Bovorntat!

17
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
It is you, not me!

18
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,760
The honesty of our house
was held in high esteem,

19
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
- but at last, our names are flawed.
- No, no.

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,960
You have warned him.
You have tried to stop him.

21
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,120
You have betrayed me! You are killing me!

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,680
Muen Vorachai has been imprisoned.

23
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,720
The position of chief customs officer
of Ayothaya is now vacant.

24
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,840
Jaokhun Rat's family
has always been in charge of this post.

25
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,520
What is your thought on this matter?

26
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,959
That is true.

27
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,440
I forgot about it.

28
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,400
This duty is truly important.

29
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,680
If there are illicit activities
by any officials, the customs officer

30
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
will be aware of everything.

31
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Dear.

32
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,240
Can I take this duty myself?

33
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
You?

34
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes.

35
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
Women can do it as well, can they not?

36
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,400
They can, but…

37
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,360
you must present yourself
to the authorities

38
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,960
and be tested

39
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
if you are truly literate
and capable enough.

40
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,800
I shall do it.

41
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,160
What is with that gaze?

42
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,560
I am merely surprised.

43
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,600
This duty is truly difficult.

44
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Hand in hand, through trials and triumphs…

45
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,920
and dreams…

46
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,080
me and you…

47
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
our dream

48
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,520
is to see the people of Ayothaya

49
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,360
sleep soundly at night.

50
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,960
This is the dream we share.

51
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
My cozy little soul.

52
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,120
You are the one I share dreams with.

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,480
You truly are my love destiny,
are you not?

54
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,080
The cases involving Jerm and I

55
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,960
have put Saenkam in a difficult spot.

56
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,440
We must use this chance
to push him further.

57
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Saenkam was once a thief
under Taen Seenil's command.

58
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,160
He killed my parents.

59
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,520
He is not an ordinary shaman,

60
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,760
but an irredeemable monster.

61
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
He has raped women
in the villages they have raided.

62
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,120
Saenkam is nothing but a wild animal.

63
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,120
My only concern

64
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
is the shame it will bring us, sir.

65
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
If we can capture Saenkam,

66
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,600
we shall be ashamed no more, dear.

67
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,679
Shall this bring forth a worthy man
for our daughter to marry?

68
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,440
If they truly are worthy,
they will understand.

69
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,600
If they are ignorant
and wish for only untouched women,

70
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,320
then they are not worthy.

71
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
You are too stubborn.

72
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,760
I am not stubborn,
but simply strong-willed.

73
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,200
Listen to me, Niam.

74
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,440
Do not be weak,

75
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,640
and do not dwell on the past.

76
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,840
Is it true that many women

77
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
have reported his offenses, sir?

78
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,840
I have.

79
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,760
He has violated me as well.

80
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,440
Let us face the slanders together.

81
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,040
For mere citizens such as us, the only way
to stand against all the powerful figures

82
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,480
is to unite and fight as one.

83
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,600
But we shall fight with wisdom.

84
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,440
- Have them.
- Thank you. Thank you.

85
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,680
Have them all. Once you have them,
stay and protect our master as well.

86
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,720
- Certainly, sir.
- Do not go anywhere.

87
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,080
That is all.

88
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,960
- All right.
- This is truly sacred.

89
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,840
Have them.

90
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,040
Why are there so few of them today?

91
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,920
Hey! Where are you all going?!

92
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,080
Stay. I shall treat you all to a meal.

93
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
- Oh, that is kind of you!
- Oh. Good, good.

94
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,160
- Hey!
- We are staying.

95
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,280
Stop protecting the wicked!

96
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
You again!

97
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,920
When will you stop
causing trouble for my master?!

98
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,160
Everyone! This man

99
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,080
is the one who falsely accused our master!
Grab your weapons!

100
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
You are reckless to come alone.

101
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Your two hands and two feet

102
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,200
cannot intimidate me!

103
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,920
Hey! Who said there are
only two hands and two feet?

104
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
Count again.

105
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,080
Without strength, we must have wisdom.

106
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,800
And wisdom alone is not enough.

107
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
We need allies as well.

108
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
You have all been fooled by Saenkam!

109
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,160
All of us have lost our money,
our bodies, and our dignity!

110
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,600
I know that you all are struggling

111
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,840
to make a living and are going
through illness without help.

112
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,280
But this blind devotion

113
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,880
shall only make your lives worse.

114
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
Return to your duties and trades!

115
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,280
Your karma has now
caught up to you, Saenkam!

116
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,440
These soldiers are here to capture you,

117
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,800
Saenkam!

118
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,440
- Capture him! Capture him!
- Capture him! Capture him!

119
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,000
- Capture him!
- Capture him!

120
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Hey! What are you all waiting for?!
Push them out!

121
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,240
- Go!
- Come face us!

122
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
- Come here if you dare!
- Face us!

123
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,880
- Come! Face me!
- Come here!

124
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
- Come here!
- Drive them out!

125
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,640
- Get them!
- Oh!

126
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
This is not looking good! I must leave!

127
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,640
What?! Come back here!

128
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,960
I gave you the leaves!

129
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,240
You lot shall see!

130
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Please capture him, sir!

131
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,320
- Capture him!
- Capture him!

132
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,760
- Capture him! Capture him!
- Capture him! Capture him!

133
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
- Capture him! Capture him!
- Capture him! Capture him!

134
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
- Capture him! Capture him!
- Capture him! Capture him!

135
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
- Capture him!
- Capture him!

136
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,640
Anyone who dare approach
my house shall face this.

137
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,680
If any of you wish to be rammed
in the guts, then try me.

138
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,080
Die, you fools!

139
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,720
There is another matter, sir.

140
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,520
Saenkam is wielding magic.

141
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,640
What if he conjures buffalo hides

142
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,320
inside us or put us under his curse?
We fear for our lives as well.

143
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
For that, I have already
prepared the defense.

144
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,040
I shall let every one of you have these.

145
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,080
Here.

146
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Master.

147
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,960
We cannot stay any longer!

148
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,160
Then we must leave!

149
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,600
- Where is he?
- Shame on you, Saenkam.

150
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
He was defeated
by Khun Saengplarn's magic.

151
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Let us go.

152
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
Split up and search!

153
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Saenkam has disappeared.

154
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,880
He did not disappear, My Lord.
He was simply using illusion magic.

155
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,960
I have sent my men to investigate.

156
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
There is still someone in the house.

157
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,880
Cha is still inside. That means

158
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,400
Saenkam has not fled anywhere.

159
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,640
I shall not flee!

160
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,080
I shall stay and become
the minister of Ayothaya!

161
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,920
I am tired of being a forest bandit!

162
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
I shall not go anywhere!

163
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,480
Oh, Master. We must flee!

164
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,600
Flee while we still have
some wealth in our hands!

165
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,160
If we wait until they capture us,

166
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
they shall seize it all, Master!

167
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,120
He has not fled,
but we could not capture him.

168
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,600
Pansaeng.

169
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Perhaps you must go capture him yourself.

170
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
I thought he had lost all his magic,

171
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,040
since he's always drunk
and committed countless sins.

172
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,040
I may need to capture him myself, My Lord.

173
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,600
You have fought with him many times.

174
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,160
How great, in your estimation,
is the might of his magic?

175
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
Without Luang Bovorntat's interference,

176
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,320
I believe it would not
be difficult for me to defeat him.

177
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,000
Saenkam and Luang Bovorntat

178
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
are the disciples of Taen Seenil, My Lord.

179
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,280
Saenkam

180
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,400
was a part of the band responsible
for killing Pansaeng's parents.

181
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,600
Taen Seenil
was the most fearsome sorcerer.

182
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,080
Has he not disappeared for a long time?

183
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
Is he still alive?

184
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,360
I have not met him myself, My Lord.

185
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,640
But the trace of his magic is clear.

186
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
What if, upon the day of his capture,

187
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,880
he is aided by Luang Bovorntat
and Taen Seenil?

188
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
Master.

189
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
I would like to request something

190
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,080
from the palace.

191
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,120
Something from the palace?

192
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,960
What is it that you want?

193
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,400
Even though Saenkam
has refused to be captured,

194
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,120
the evidence and witnesses are clear.

195
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,400
The verdicts for all his offenses
have been pronounced.

196
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,720
Saenkam must be imprisoned for 15 years.

197
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
That Saenkam.

198
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,560
If I had known he would be this terrible,
I would not have supported him, My Lord.

199
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,800
After Muen Vorachai accused you
of being a mastermind that day,

200
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,800
much talk has been heard among the people.

201
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,200
That is but folly, My Lord.

202
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,120
Are you truly trying
to start an insurrection?

203
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,440
Jaokhun!

204
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,360
Do not ever mention
this repulsive matter to me.

205
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,520
I uphold the oath
of allegiance water with my heart,

206
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,960
and I am most loyal
to his majesty the king!

207
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,000
Very well. Regarding Saenkam,

208
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,400
I cannot help you.

209
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,200
But you have accepted
a rice concession from me, My Lord.

210
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,280
No! I have not accepted anything!

211
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,800
Take it back! I shall have it no more.

212
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,680
This Saenkam shall only bring destruction
to anyone who supports him!

213
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,320
I shall have no part in this!

214
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,360
Jaokhun Nakorn is right, My Lord.

215
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,240
Perhaps you should cut ties with Saenkam

216
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,800
and chase him out of that house.

217
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,640
But he answers to Master Taen.

218
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Did Master Taen
ever instruct you to help him?

219
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,080
Master Taen has not appeared
before me for some time now.

220
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,680
I, myself, also wonder

221
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,600
why Master Taen does not lead
our movement himself.

222
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,160
He has only been communicating mentally.

223
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,680
Perhaps Master Taen
shall help Saenkam himself.

224
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,600
You must step away from him at once,

225
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,200
so people would stop
talking about your insurrection.

226
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,480
It is sweet and crispy.

227
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,160
Tomorrow, I wish to have

228
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,400
spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic.

229
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,640
Spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic?

230
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,600
- Boiled egg salad with pickled garlic.
- Yes.

231
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
How is it?

232
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
It is delicious.

233
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
Who cooked all this?

234
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,800
Dear, do you know?

235
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,680
This food shall help us

236
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,200
become excited tonight.

237
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,000
Very excited.

238
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,400
Dear!

239
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920
What?

240
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,560
We cannot do that.

241
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,400
I shall bring Saenkam to justice tomorrow.

242
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,520
Once I am done,

243
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,200
I shall return to lie with you.

244
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,640
We shall bed.

245
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,160
We shall bed!

246
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,360
We shall bed! We shall bed!

247
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,640
We shall bed!

248
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,240
- Dear!
- We shall bed!

249
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,080
- Dear!
- We shall bed!

250
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,400
- Wait! Dear!
- We shall bed!

251
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,680
We have been through hardships.
Now, we shall be happy together, Va.

252
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
Well…

253
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
Will you be all right?

254
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,960
I do not know.

255
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,400
What?

256
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,400
- Listen, Va.
- You are such…

257
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,280
Va. Listen to me.

258
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,280
Master Nandha asked me if I wished

259
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,440
for a life of power

260
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,520
or death surrounded by love.

261
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
I have already chosen, Va.

262
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,880
I have chosen.

263
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
Dear.

264
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,760
The mere thought of you confronting
those terrible foes tomorrow

265
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,160
has already filled me
with much worry for you.

266
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,920
I have fought in many battles, Va.

267
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,800
Without my magic,

268
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,120
first, I shall use my wisdom.

269
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,120
Second, I have my allies.

270
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,840
And third,

271
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,880
there is something I will use tomorrow.

272
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,360
Will you truly be able to win?

273
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,240
I will.

274
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,200
Tomorrow, I shall go and capture Saenkam.

275
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
I shall successfully avenge

276
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
my parents

277
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,880
and my sister for being murdered.

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,520
No!

279
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,160
This is me.

280
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,320
I don’t appreciate you
approaching me like this!

281
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
Luang Bovorntat.

282
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,080
You must help me.

283
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
Pansaeng will be coming for me tomorrow.

284
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,160
The rumors are that I intend to start
an insurrection! I can't help you!

285
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,680
My magical power has diminished.

286
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,000
I could not even overpower
his protective rings!

287
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,880
You are finally starting to realize

288
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
your own ignorance, are you not?

289
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,800
But I am afraid it is too late!

290
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
If tonight

291
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,200
we pray to summon our master to help us,

292
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,080
he shall answer both our calls!

293
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,480
Could it be that Master Taen

294
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,720
has already abandoned you?

295
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,200
Impossible.

296
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
You have seen with your own eyes

297
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,360
that Pansaeng is more infatuated
with his wife lately.

298
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,520
His magic is weakening as well!

299
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,080
And if our master
comes to help us tomorrow,

300
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,760
the three of us shall kill him!

301
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,360
What if Master does not come?!

302
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
Master Taen knows very well
what we are going through!

303
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,240
With Pansaeng out of the way,

304
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,120
seizing this nation shall be child's play.

305
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,920
Do not abandon me.
We must help one another.

306
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,840
Tomorrow

307
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,080
shall be the last day of Pansaeng's life!

308
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
Va.

309
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,000
Is there anything wrong?

310
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,200
Laor.

311
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,640
How do military families

312
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,840
even live their lives?

313
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,560
Seeing their loved ones go to battles,

314
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,360
not knowing when the last time would be.

315
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,560
No. Do not speak of this, Va.

316
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,280
Khun Saengplarn
is truly confident about this task.

317
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,840
He even reminded me

318
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,000
to cook spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic. He'll return for it.

319
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,200
All shall be fine, Va.

320
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,720
Master! Master!

321
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,000
Master!

322
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,840
Master.

323
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,880
We must flee now.
Pansaeng and his men are coming.

324
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,120
Master! We must leave!

325
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
No.

326
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,960
I will not flee.

327
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
Pansaeng.

328
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,080
I do not fear you.
You shall face me today.

329
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,680
By the very law of the Kingdom of Ayothaya

330
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,280
and with the King's own assent,

331
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,840
Khun Saengplarn
is charged to take into custody

332
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,600
the suspect, Saenkam.

333
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,440
Among his offenses are conspiracy

334
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,920
to murder Noi and Phin

335
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,280
and the violation of Niam, Porn, and Soi.

336
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,960
Beyond that, he swindled a great deal
of money from countless citizens,

337
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,880
leaving them utterly destitute.

338
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
I have done nothing.

339
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,840
You lot have been
worshipping me yourselves!

340
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,560
You have given me your wealth
and yourselves, all for your own purposes.

341
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
I have done no wrong.

342
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,480
Capture him. Go!

343
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,560
- Go! Go!
- Charge him!

344
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,080
- Capture him!
- What?!

345
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,880
- Take him!
- Bring him to justice!

346
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,719
Pansaeng! Free me at once!

347
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,239
Fight me if you dare!

348
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,160
- Sir!
- Sir!

349
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,280
- You!
- Do not approach him!

350
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,200
Only capture him when he is unconscious.

351
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,920
At last, I shall defeat you, Pansaeng!

352
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,640
Pansaeng.

353
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,080
Today is your very last day, not mine!

354
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,080
Do you recall your time as a thief,

355
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,240
when you killed villagers

356
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,360
and raped countless women?
Do you remember?!

357
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,120
I certainly do.

358
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,760
Among them
are your parents and your sister.

359
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,080
Are you considering me
your brother-in-law?

360
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,440
Then call me brother. Brother. Brother.

361
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,040
Nightmares have plagued me every night.

362
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,480
I have been seething
with vengeance against you!

363
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
The same goes
for all these people behind me.

364
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,520
They are overflowing
with hatred and anger,

365
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,520
enough to destroy you many times over!

366
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,720
If the power of love exists,
the power of vengeance

367
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,600
shall be even greater.

368
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,280
I hereby summon every ghost with vengeance

369
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,920
and every curse there is!

370
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,680
May the wheel of karma turn on you!

371
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,880
May the due consequence
of your ill-doing befall you even now!

372
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Noi, if you are still roaming this realm,

373
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,160
come and take your revenge!

374
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,240
Phin, my dear. Do not let this vile soul

375
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,240
continue to poison our land.
Come and drag him to hell!

376
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,360
You lowly ghosts!

377
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,120
What can you possibly do to me?!

378
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,520
Father. Mother.

379
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,560
Phueng.

380
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Saenkam.

381
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,200
I curse you to the deepest hell.

382
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,400
The prison of Ayothaya awaits you!

383
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,720
Saenkam has passed out, sir!

384
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,120
Everyone. Let us capture him.

385
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,600
- Go!
- Go!

386
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,400
We have brought him to justice!

387
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,320
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

388
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,920
Go! Take him to prison!

389
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,520
No reason for me to stay now!

390
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,000
Hey!

391
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,600
You, stop! Stop at once!

392
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,760
Where are you going?! Huh?!

393
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,680
Are those the possessions
you have been taking from people?

394
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,640
Uh, no!

395
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Hand them over to me.

396
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,840
- Well…
- Hand them over!

397
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
- I said hand them over.
- These are mine!

398
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,720
- Hand them over! Hand them over!
- No!

399
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,240
Hey, wait! Stop!

400
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,120
Phin, I did it! We brought him down!

401
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,600
Without strength,

402
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,640
we must have wisdom.

403
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,640
But if wisdom is not enough

404
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,120
and allies can't do anything to him,

405
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
we must rely on curses

406
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,440
and vengeful spirits.

407
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,320
- Master Saenkam!
- Master, please help me!

408
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,760
- Please help me!
- Master!

409
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,320
- Master Saenkam!
- Master! Master!

410
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
Master! Is that you, Master?!

411
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,120
Master! Wake up! Master!

412
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,120
Master! Awaken! Master! Master!

413
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
Help me, Master! Master!

414
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
- Master Saenkam! Wake up!
- Help me, Master!

415
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,840
- Master! Please help me! Master!
- Help, Master!

416
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,240
- Please help me, Master!
- Silence!

417
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,760
- I said silence! Silence!
- Master!

418
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,720
Every time I see your face,

419
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,040
I imagine killing you myself

420
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,280
over and over, hundreds of times.

421
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,840
But what I wished to see the most

422
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,520
is this very image,

423
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,640
you being imprisoned
by the law of this nation.

424
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,080
Because I truly wish for the law

425
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,120
to be the greatest weapon
for people of all statuses.

426
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,400
And my wish has now been realized.

427
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,840
Sir.

428
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,360
These magic-wielding people
have spells to unbind the locks.

429
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,640
What if he frees himself

430
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,800
- and tries to kill us?
- I have prepared for that matter.

431
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,200
The cane of Revered Grandfather Chote.

432
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,120
It was bestowed by the king himself.

433
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,040
What if, upon the day of his capture,

434
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,920
he is aided by Luang Bovorntat
and Taen Seenil?

435
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,080
Master.

436
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,840
I would like to request
something from the palace.

437
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,160
Something from the palace?

438
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,480
What is it that you want?

439
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,680
When highly revered monks
or sorcerers near the end of their lives,

440
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,520
their canes or sticks
become the most sacred items,

441
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,800
imbued with their highest mental power.

442
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,720
The cane of Revered Grandfather Chote?

443
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,320
Yes, My Lord.

444
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,160
His disciples have presented the cane

445
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
to the previous king.

446
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,960
The cane of Revered Grandfather Chote
is now stored in the royal palace.

447
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,440
You are the Minister
of the Royal Household.

448
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,200
Could you request this cane
to be bestowed to me, My Lord?

449
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,920
Yes.

450
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,120
I shall manage it for you.

451
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,240
The cane of Revered Grandfather Chote

452
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,360
shall protect you from Saenkam's magic

453
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,920
and prevent him from breaking out.

454
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,280
Oh, Master.

455
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,520
Va!

456
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,280
- Va.
- Laor?

457
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,920
Khun Saengplarn is safe.
Saenkam is now imprisoned.

458
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,160
What of the others?

459
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,840
No one is injured.

460
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,600
That is a great relief.

461
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,480
<i>Once I am done,</i>
<i>I shall return to lie with you.</i>

462
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,440
We shall bed.

463
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,520
We shall bed! We shall bed!

464
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,160
We shall bed! We shall bed!

465
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,680
What should I do?

466
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,920
What is it?

467
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,160
Jerm is overjoyed.

468
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,320
He said you called the spirits
to help fight Saenkam.

469
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,320
It was not the greatest act.

470
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,040
I rarely do such things,
but it was necessary.

471
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,280
Well,

472
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,800
I saw my parents and Phueng as well.

473
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,680
Dear.

474
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,840
- Is that true?
- Yes.

475
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,800
Well,

476
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,360
are their spirits
still roaming this realm?

477
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,040
Their souls must be reincarnated by now,

478
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,160
yet my vengeance

479
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,920
may have bound
fragments of them to this place.

480
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,560
This vengeance

481
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,120
was the reason you learned
and practiced your crafts

482
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,440
and

483
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,560
became the best there is.

484
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,040
What?

485
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,240
I only want to see this Gardenia Squirrel.

486
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,280
It is truly beautiful.

487
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,200
Yes.

488
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,280
Oh?

489
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,840
I am thirsty.

490
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,600
Yes.

491
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,840
What?!

492
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,920
Napkin.

493
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yes.

494
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,920
Your dinner, sir.

495
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,080
Where are the dishes I asked for?

496
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,160
It appears there are none.
These are good as well.

497
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,120
What?

498
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,280
What of spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic?

499
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,040
There is none, dear.

500
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,440
Oh, Va…

501
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,920
Dear.

502
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,240
Please enjoy your meal.

503
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,600
You are such…

504
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,400
My Lord.

505
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,200
Is your injury severe, My Lord?

506
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,200
It is not serious.

507
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,080
A few days of medicine
may suffice to recover.

508
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,880
Why did you choose
to lend Saenkam your help?

509
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,640
I thought Master Taen would appear.

510
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,240
Saenkam was right

511
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,480
about how Pansaeng is weakened
by his infatuation with his wife.

512
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,800
But how could Master Taen
forsake this chance?

513
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,200
Why did he not come?

514
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,040
Perhaps he has another plan, My Lord.

515
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,760
Va.

516
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,280
Have you waited long?

517
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,480
Laor. Where is Khun Saengplarn?

518
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,680
In the raft house.
He must be asleep by now.

519
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:37,920
Dear!

520
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,800
It seems you use a different soap.

521
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,920
The scent is different than mine.

522
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,000
Not long ago,

523
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,960
a beautiful lady

524
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,040
invited me to bathe with her.

525
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,720
Tonight,

526
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,120
shall we take a bath together?

527
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,640
I most enjoy it.

528
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,120
We shall bathe in cold water,

529
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,800
then scrub, rinse,

530
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,800
and play with each other.

531
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,160
Please take a bath with me, dear.

532
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,920
Your words kept me dreaming
for many nights.

533
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,320
I am finished. You may continue, dear.

534
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,960
Va.

535
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,720
What is it, dear?

536
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,240
There's a man

537
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,280
who willingly sacrifices his life

538
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,080
to appreciate your beauty,

539
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,040
who is willing to suffer
the greatest pain,

540
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,200
only to enjoy your warmth for tonight.

541
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,880
Will you truly destroy that man's heart?

542
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,360
Dear, wait.

543
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,480
Dear!

544
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,920
Dear!

545
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,200
Dear!

546
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,480
Dear!

547
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,800
Dear. Dear.

548
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Dear!

549
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,440
Dear!

550
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,280
Does it hurt?

551
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,320
Dear.

552
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Dear.

553
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Please don't be unwell. Please be fine.

554
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,080
Are you feeling better?

555
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,160
Hold my hand.

556
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,320
Give me your strength.

557
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,920
Embrace me,

558
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,360
so I do not feel cold.

559
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,320
You knew you would
have to suffer like this.

560
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,840
Why did you still do it?

561
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,720
After only a few days of rest,

562
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,880
I shall be fine.

563
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,440
Why would you do it,
knowing this would happen?

564
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,640
Without love,

565
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,440
I shall have no strength.

566
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,440
How have you become this person?

567
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,680
When I told you

568
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,920
I shall capture Saenkam,

569
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,880
I truly did not know…

570
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,520
if I would be able to defeat him.

571
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,360
A vile soul such as Saenkam does not
possess the merits to cure anyone.

572
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,360
Should all go as planned, in ten days,

573
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,440
we shall lie together.

574
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,200
My hope alone

575
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,840
made my blood truly surge, empowering me.

576
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,240
My body was full of strength.

577
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,000
Please let me sleep
in the main house with you,

578
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,200
so we can finally lie together.

579
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,160
Only the thought

580
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,680
of lying asleep beside you

581
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,080
already gave me the strength

582
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,880
and energy I need.

583
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,000
I truly do enjoy this feeling.

584
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,880
Oh, dear…

585
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,640
Chai is consumed by fever,

586
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,720
and so are you.

587
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,520
Everyone is dying.

588
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,840
Sir, look!

589
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,800
What is that?

590
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,480
Taen Seenil is coming.

591
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,000
Is it possible that…

592
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,920
Prai has become Taen Seenil's disciple.

593
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,120
My time is now!

594
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,400
- Let us go!
- We are free!

595
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,920
It shall not be that easy.

596
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,480
Pansaeng! There he comes again!

597
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,920
Kill Khun Saengplarn

598
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,120
and join Prai's band!

599
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,280
Jaokhun Singh's company! Fight on!

600
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,120
Fight on!

601
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,760
