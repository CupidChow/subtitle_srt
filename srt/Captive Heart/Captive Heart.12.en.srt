1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,840
It is our human nature to believe

2
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,160
that achievements come from
the sacred power, rather than ourselves.

3
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,920
Are you here to challenge me?

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
You have robbed my family!

5
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Father, Mother,

6
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,640
this is Pansaeng,

7
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,920
the one I am wedded to.

8
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,680
Your magic has faded now.

9
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
It was not my doing!

10
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
Muen Vorachai!

11
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,600
Va.

12
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Please wake up. Wake up for this medicine.

13
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
Please.

14
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,160
Dear.

15
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
How are you two doing?

16
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,400
I have been taking medicine
for two days. I am well now.

17
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
Is Lady Chavala badly injured?

18
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
Yes, My Lady.

19
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,200
The only one who can treat
such a severe wound

20
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,240
would be Doctor Ninkhong,
the Western physician.

21
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
My family is his benefactor.

22
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
If you need his help,
I can ask him for you.

23
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
Really? Are you willing
to help me, Lady Pim?

24
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Yes.

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,840
But I must ask for something in return.

26
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,960
Once she has fully recovered,

27
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
you must leave her

28
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,600
and marry me.

29
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,040
Lady Pim. This is a person's life.

30
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,640
And do not ever think

31
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,560
of asking Jaokhun Singh
to beg for Doctor Ninkhong's help.

32
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,280
Doctor Ninkhong only listens to one man,

33
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,760
and that is my father.

34
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,160
If only I forbade, he would not come.

35
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,960
You wish for me to leave Va?

36
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,840
She is now her savior.

37
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,880
If Lady Chavala recovers
and he breaks his promise,

38
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,400
then he will be utterly ungrateful.

39
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,160
Shall we proceed?

40
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,760
No…

41
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
No…

42
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,520
Va.

43
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
She spoke some words, sir.

44
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
What is it, dear?

45
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
Do not wed…

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
You must not wed her.

47
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,160
Va said "Do not wed her."
He must not wed her.

48
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,880
It was clear.

49
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,040
But there is only one Western physician.

50
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,440
There is no one else.

51
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,080
And no one has survived a wound
that severe with this kind of treatment.

52
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,240
Do you not fear for her?

53
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,880
If we are to separate,

54
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,360
I would rather die…

55
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
I would rather die.

56
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
No, dear. We shall not separate.

57
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,920
I… I shall not wed her as well.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
And you shall not die.

59
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
You shall not die.

60
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,640
What a foolish lady.

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,400
Do you not cherish your own life?

62
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
Oh, Va.

63
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,160
You are such…

64
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,960
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away! Go!

65
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,880
- Get out! Get out!
- Hey! Listen!

66
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,280
It was Khun Saengplarn and Lady Va
who were attacked by your false idol!

67
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,640
She is fatally wounded

68
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,920
and resting inside
because of your Master's ploy!

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Nonsense! You are accusing Master Saenkam.

70
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
He is a man of virtue!
Why would he attack people?!

71
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away!

72
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,680
Leave at once!
The injured need a quiet rest!

73
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
I have received
a report from Khun Saengplarn.

74
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,559
He accuses Luang Bovorntat

75
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,400
of assaulting him and his wife.

76
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,799
Assaulting? What is this, My Lord?

77
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,799
Two days ago, in the woods near Wat Raeng,

78
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,920
Saenkam and Luang Bovorntat

79
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
fought with Khun Saengplarn.

80
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
It did not happen, My Lord.

81
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,280
That day, Luang Bovorntat
was here, in this house, with me.

82
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
He was meditating to dedicate
the merits to his ancestors.

83
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,640
I can confirm it.

84
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,880
But Khun Saengplarn stated

85
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,880
that both parties were injured.

86
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,640
And he has told me the specific place
of Luang Bovorntat's wound.

87
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,080
That is the reason I am here
to investigate. Let me in.

88
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,720
I cannot, My Lord!

89
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,640
- Soldiers!
- Yes, My Lord!

90
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,880
Open the door!

91
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,160
Praise be upon you, Master Taen.

92
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,280
You are here to save me right on time.

93
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Greetings, Chief of the Armed Forces.

94
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,680
My Lord.

95
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
I heard you wish
to investigate my body wounds.

96
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,400
As you wish.

97
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
I have no wounds
and was not in a fight with anybody.

98
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,040
Khun Saengplarn has falsely
accused me once again, My Lord.

99
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
Mor Thongpin said

100
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,680
that her kin should come
see her for the last time.

101
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Va.

102
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,200
People are here to visit you.

103
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
Look.

104
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
This is not true, is it, sir?

105
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,320
She is but a young lady.

106
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Is it truly Muen Vorachai's doing, sir?

107
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,040
I shall kill him.

108
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Aon.

109
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,960
No… Aon.

110
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,680
Listen to me.

111
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Do not hurt him, Aon.

112
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,160
Dear. Dear.

113
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,840
Do not hurt…

114
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,320
- Chai. Do you understand?
- Yes.

115
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,360
- Please.
- I shall not hurt him. I shall not.

116
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
I shall not.

117
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,840
He has wounded her this much,

118
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,680
and she still calls him her brother.

119
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,080
Why must good people

120
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
fall prey and die?

121
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
- My Lady! My dear lady!
- My Lady!

122
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
Please do not leave us! Please!

123
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
- My Lady!
- My Lady.

124
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Your lady is only exhausted.

125
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,840
Servants such as us have no privileges.

126
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,640
We were born to serve the cruel master.

127
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,360
Without her,

128
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,960
we shall no longer have a future.

129
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
Once she's gone,
we are all doomed to die horribly.

130
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Please do not die, My Lady.

131
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Sir, you have your magic.

132
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,440
Can you not help Lady Va?

133
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Tian, listen to my words.

134
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
No power in this world

135
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,640
can stop us from dying.

136
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,200
My Lady!

137
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,360
Please do not leave us. Please!

138
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Please do not leave us!

139
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,560
- My Lady.
- My Lady…

140
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
Va…

141
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Laor.

142
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Yes, sir.

143
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
- Have you heard that sound?
- A bell rang.

144
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,880
A bell.

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Master.

146
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,640
You are here.

147
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
My miracle has arrived.

148
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,960
I arrived late
because I had to gather herbs uphill.

149
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,720
But I have them now.

150
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,960
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,560
I have been meditating
and reaching out to you.

152
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,080
You must have heard my calling.

153
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,000
Remove her upper garment.

154
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,920
I shall use this herb to mend her wound.

155
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,680
You must watch closely,

156
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,360
since it must be changed twice a day.

157
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,920
Yes, Master.

158
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,320
Loss is a part of life.

159
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Sorrow

160
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,960
shall only bring desolation to your spirit

161
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,640
and the spirits of those you love.

162
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,040
Let us pray together in the prayer hall.

163
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,840
Come, Tian. Let us go pray.

164
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,800
A strong spirit
originates in a strong mind,

165
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,640
not a weakened one.

166
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,640
Pray to strengthen your minds

167
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,400
and you shall be able to give
strong spiritual support to your lady.

168
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,040
All creatures in this world

169
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,160
are bound together by love.

170
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,720
<i>The rivers love the forests.</i>

171
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,080
<i>The forests love the earth.</i>
<i>The earth loves the trees.</i>

172
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
<i>And the trees bring life.</i>

173
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,280
<i>Every one of us</i>
<i>comes into being through love.</i>

174
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,320
<i>What it takes to make your lady recover</i>

175
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,480
is nothing other than love.

176
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,000
Jaokhun.

177
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,680
You are drunk like a dog.

178
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
Greetings, My Lord.

179
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,680
You have committed a crime

180
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
by assaulting Lady Chavala.

181
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,280
No, My Lord.

182
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
It was not my doing.

183
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,680
We have all the evidence.
You shall not get away.

184
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I do not know anything, My Lord.

185
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,120
You are the vile monster

186
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
who would even kill their own sister,

187
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,640
and I most wish to have you executed!

188
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
But luck is still on your side

189
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,120
because Lady Chavala
has asked me to spare you.

190
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,920
Va asked you to spare me?

191
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
That is right!

192
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,040
Keep in your mind

193
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
that your sister is the most merciful!

194
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
She loves you unconditionally.

195
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,200
So, has a monster such as you

196
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,440
ever loved anyone? Huh?!

197
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,880
If no one claims to be harmed,
no charges will follow.

198
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,920
Why have you come to me then?

199
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,760
Even if I cannot punish you by law,

200
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,680
the consequences of your sins
shall never stop haunting you!

201
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,520
Seeing your worn-out appearance,

202
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,560
I believe damned spirits
are coming for you!

203
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,440
- Go away!
- Out!

204
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,680
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away!

205
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,160
- Out! Go away!
- Stop! Stop at once!

206
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,520
You all are wrong to protect him.

207
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,960
Saenkam is wielding damned magic.

208
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,840
He wishes for us to kill one another.
Why must you protect him?

209
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,280
And who are you?

210
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,320
My name is Chuang,

211
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,280
Luang Athikorn's servant.

212
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
He believed what Saenkam instructed

213
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
and killed my pregnant wife

214
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,760
to offer her blood to the magical plant

215
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
that he believed could cure his child.

216
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,840
So, it is you

217
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,760
who has falsely accused
our Master Saenkam!

218
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,000
My accusation was not false.

219
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,240
Luang Athikorn's child
was doing better for only a few weeks.

220
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,640
The condition has worsened again.

221
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
What do you gain from this accusation?
Who hired you to do this?

222
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,560
No one hired me.

223
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
I am here only to open your eyes.

224
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,160
Khun Saengplarn is a good man.

225
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,160
His wife has been
badly injured by Saenkam.

226
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
And you are here to condemn him?

227
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,680
You all are foolish and cruel.
You are monsters!

228
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,160
You dare oppose us? Get him!

229
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,560
- Hey! Come here!
- Get him! Go!

230
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,800
- Come here!
- Hold him!

231
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,160
You vile civil servant!
You used magic on citizens!

232
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,920
I am a citizen as well.

233
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,280
I can report you all
for threatening me at my house!

234
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,320
You are assaulting a man.

235
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,200
I am a soldier, and I can
arrest all of you right now.

236
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,200
The nobles in this land
only exploit the citizens,

237
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,160
unlike Master Saenkam, who helps us all!

238
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,720
You always rely on the sorcerer.

239
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,400
You never lift a finger, yet you expect
all the magic to do your bidding.

240
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,920
And that is precisely why you are all
victims of the wicked, such as Saenkam.

241
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,320
That is true. Do you expect
Saenkam to help you out of prison?

242
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,480
Right.

243
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Leave.

244
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Leave my house!

245
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,440
If you shall not leave, then…

246
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,720
- Hey! Go! Go!
- Run!

247
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,200
Try me.

248
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,200
You have my thanks, sir.

249
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,920
You saved me.

250
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Thank you for coming today.

251
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,080
When I barged into the palace,

252
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
only Jaokhun Singh and you

253
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,120
offered help, which led
to my release from prison.

254
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,720
It is best if you do not return.

255
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,200
Those people have gone insane.

256
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,520
Nothing can stop them.

257
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
I am now a wandering man.
I still cannot hold Luang Athikorn

258
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,720
and that monster Saenkam accountable.

259
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,680
I feel profoundly wronged.

260
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,480
Do not lose hope.

261
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,240
Find your wife's body. Once found,
we shall use all evidence to capture them.

262
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
Yes, sir.

263
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,400
One more thing.

264
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,360
Gather those
who have been wronged by Saenkam.

265
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,320
To defeat a giant when you are small,

266
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,480
you need to gather many small people.

267
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,800
Yes, sir.

268
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Enlivened effigy magic
is the highest technique of our school.

269
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,200
You are the best among your peers,

270
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,240
which is why Master Yai
entrusted you with this magic.

271
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,200
<i>The ones who have mastered this magic</i>

272
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,800
<i>are feared even by Taen Seenil.</i>

273
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,280
I shall teach you
how to multiply your magic power

274
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,240
to infuse it into the enlivened effigies.

275
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
Your enemies

276
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
shall be battling duplicates
of yourself simultaneously.

277
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,400
It is the highest technique of our school.

278
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
You did not teach it to anyone easily.

279
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,440
Are you truly entrusting it to me, Master?

280
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,320
You must protect it with your life.

281
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,920
My pride in this magic was immense.

282
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,480
I have been waiting for the day

283
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,720
Taen Seenil emerges

284
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,960
to exact my revenge
with my enlivened effigy magic.

285
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
Taen Seenil is behind
a looming insurrection.

286
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,320
A major war is on the horizon.

287
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,000
Should Lady Chavala die,

288
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,200
your magic shall be restored
to its full strength.

289
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,120
You shall win this war

290
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,920
without any help.

291
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,960
I cannot allow Lady Chavala to die.

292
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,280
If Lady Chavala is well again,

293
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,600
will you be able to resist loving her?

294
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
To wield the magic of this magnitude,

295
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
one must bear
a severe curse from its master.

296
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,280
I truly do not know

297
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,680
what will happen between me and Va.

298
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,800
I only know

299
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,320
that I cannot bear to witness her death.

300
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,920
Then, there is only one way.

301
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,880
You must be a traitorous disciple,

302
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
same as me.

303
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,360
Your meal, Master.

304
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
- Hey! Get up!
- Up!

305
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
- Hey! Up!
- What are you doing?!

306
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,720
- Get up!
- Up!

307
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,880
Get up!

308
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,200
You are to teach me the highest technique?

309
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
To summon the enlivened effigies?

310
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,920
But you must vow
to abstain from lustful desires.

311
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,680
I shall give this magic to you.

312
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,280
Protect it with your life.

313
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,360
<i>If one day you are consumed by lust</i>

314
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,920
<i>and let yourself be entangled with men,</i>

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,880
<i>may every bone in your body</i>

316
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,920
<i>shatter. May your every muscle</i>

317
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
<i>burn like fire.</i>

318
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,280
- <i>May your spirit be torn</i>
- Nandha!

319
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,320
<i>and descend into hellfire.</i>

320
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,600
How dare you violate
the vow you made to me?!

321
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,880
You are consumed by lust.

322
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,400
Confess! Who have you fallen for?!

323
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
Please forgive me!

324
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,360
I have tried to stop myself.

325
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,520
I love you with all my heart.

326
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,360
Forgive me, Master!

327
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,920
With your disgusting desire,

328
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,320
I am most disappointed in you!

329
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,440
Anyone outside?! Come!

330
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,440
No!

331
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,320
Take her to the foothills and leave her.

332
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,040
She is no longer one of my disciples!

333
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,080
No!

334
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,720
Please! Do not abandon me.

335
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,760
I have lived here since childhood.
I do not have anyone but you.

336
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,640
If I leave this hill, I will not survive!

337
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Please do not abandon me.

338
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,640
- What shall we do, Master?
- Please…

339
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
Leave her there.

340
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
I care not if she lives or dies!

341
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
Do not abandon me, Master.

342
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,080
I only have you in my life!

343
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,120
- Please do not abandon me!
- Take her!

344
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,480
Please! No!

345
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,440
No! No! I shall not go! No!

346
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,200
- Come here!
- No!

347
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,720
Do not abandon me! Please!

348
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,880
Master, please do not abandon me!

349
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Please do not abandon me!

350
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,560
No! No!

351
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,280
<i>No love,</i>

352
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,720
no strength.

353
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,080
Where did this board come from?

354
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,600
Where love takes root, wisdom withers.

355
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,440
Where love takes root,
miracles shall blossom.

356
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,000
I happen to be more fond of that text.

357
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,240
There.

358
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,760
A life devoid of love
is a life of nullity.

359
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,720
Are those wood boards

360
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,520
with texts defying Master Yai's teachings

361
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,560
your doing?

362
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,600
Now you must choose.

363
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,480
A life of power

364
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,560
or death surrounded by love.

365
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,480
Go!

366
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,120
<i>You possess the highest willpower,</i>
<i>which makes you the best candidate.</i>

367
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,240
<i>Yet, a technique this advanced</i>

368
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,360
comes with a severe curse from its master.

369
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,800
A curse, Master?

370
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,720
Yes.

371
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,760
Ancient masters wished to pass on their
magic through the long line of disciples.

372
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,280
So, they have infused curses
to make each disciple

373
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,720
gain the highest willpower
without distractions.

374
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,080
Should you betray
your sacred oath by loving any woman,

375
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,880
you shall suffer excruciating pain,

376
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,159
leading to a horrific death.

377
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,440
I beg for your forgiveness, Master Yai.

378
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,159
I am begging you

379
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,280
to please have mercy on me.

380
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,280
<i>Now you must choose.</i>

381
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,440
<i>A life of power</i>

382
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>or death surrounded by love.</i>

383
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,800
Va.

384
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,400
My dear.

385
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,520
I can no longer hold on.

386
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,040
I cannot…

387
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,080
Do not speak such words, Va.

388
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,320
You are crushing my heart.

389
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,760
I

390
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,920
picked some flowers for you.

391
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,240
Here.

392
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
I have wedded you

393
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,040
as a ploy.

394
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,840
I never imagined I would be gifted
with such a heavenly soul.

395
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,440
I know…

396
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,120
one day that soul must return to heaven.

397
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,680
But can I not have more time?

398
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,400
Dear.

399
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,640
Please…

400
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,920
give up on me.

401
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,600
No.

402
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,640
Dear…

403
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
No.

404
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,520
Come.

405
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,120
I have chosen.

406
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,080
Listen to my words.

407
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,000
Listen,

408
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,400
and keep it in your mind.

409
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,200
Even if my bones shatter,

410
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
my muscles burn like fire,

411
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,160
and my spirit descends
into the deepest hell,

412
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,880
I shall love you still.

413
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
I shall be with you till my last breath.

414
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,600
You are taking my life away

415
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,080
since my love for you
makes my heart break.

416
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,280
So, please be well.

417
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,480
Recover, and live our lives together.

418
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,280
Please.

419
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,640
My cozy little soul.

420
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
This lady

421
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,840
is driven by love.

422
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,120
It is in her nature to love others.

423
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,640
Hence, there is only one way

424
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,080
to give her a reason to live on.

425
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,080
That reason is love.

426
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,080
<i>If one day you are consumed by lust</i>

427
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,240
<i>and let yourself be entangled with women,</i>

428
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,640
<i>may your every muscle</i>

429
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,160
<i>shatter.</i>

430
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,960
<i>May your spirit be torn</i>

431
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,440
<i>and descend into hellfire.</i>

432
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,360
You have accepted love into your heart.

433
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,680
Henceforth, bamboo flowers
shall not be able to help you.

434
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,320
You must take this medicine.

435
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,760
Thank you, Master.

436
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
You shall feel better, albeit temporarily.

437
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,080
Then, you shall experience pain
from time to time.

438
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Well,

439
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,720
when will my life come to an end?

440
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,120
No one knows.

441
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,200
My magic shall fade away.

442
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,040
I shall become an ordinary man,

443
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,600
like Prai.

444
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,680
Then,

445
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,800
my enemies shall all come to kill me.

446
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,520
Not yet.

447
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,520
Your magic shall slowly fade away.
You shall still have it for years.

448
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,000
Then, I shall quickly
prevent the insurrection

449
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,840
and get rid of Taen Seenil.

450
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,600
Yes.

451
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,200
Remember

452
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,600
that life shall find a way.

453
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,560
Do not surrender.

454
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,800
From now,

455
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,400
you shall eventually
lose the power of magic,

456
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,960
but you have the power of love.

457
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,760
And you shall know

458
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,200
how powerful love is.

459
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,400
Master Nandha,
thank you for saving my life.

460
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,520
She could barely speak yesterday,
and now she is sitting up.

461
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,000
The power of love allowed you to go on.

462
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,040
It is the most powerful.

463
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,120
It is the origin
and the aspiration of us humans.

464
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,520
She is truly
the most skilled healer in Ayothaya.

465
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,880
Master Nandha.

466
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Laor told me Khun Saengplarn is unwell.

467
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,320
What caused his illness?

468
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,520
He shall recover in a few days.

469
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,600
He was suddenly bedridden, Master?

470
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,280
Once he recovers,
you may ask him yourself.

471
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,880
Very well.

472
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,440
Lady Chavala survived?! How could she?

473
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,040
A magical healer
came to treat her, My Lady.

474
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,360
I heard people say they saw Lady Chavala

475
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,160
walking and giving alms
to the monks this morning.

476
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,000
She can already walk?

477
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,720
These wicked people
who use love charms on others

478
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,520
take too long to die
and be punished in hell.

479
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,760
Yes, My Lady. What a shame.

480
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,040
If she dies,

481
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,080
Khun Saengplarn will be awakened
from that damned magic.

482
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,000
He must truly be under her spell.

483
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,680
I shall save him no matter what.

484
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,280
We have looked everywhere,

485
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,720
but there were
no magical plants to be found.

486
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,640
What if it is not
the same kind as what we have?

487
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
What do you mean, My Lady?

488
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,800
I have talked with many nobles,

489
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,520
and they said artifacts
are simply consecrated items.

490
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,040
They may have different shapes and sizes,

491
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,120
but the magic is what truly matters.

492
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,560
What? Is that true?

493
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,480
Then, what must we do, My Lady?

494
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,880
Come, come.
We shall not stop until we are drunk.

495
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,960
- Give me more drink. More.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,800
Come, come.

497
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,680
That is it. That is right.

498
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,360
More. Give me more.

499
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,000
This is relaxing.

500
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,800
Here I come!

501
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,640
Muan?

502
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,000
Are you having a good time, Cha?

503
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,640
Are you working today?

504
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,360
I wish to make more money

505
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,600
to ask Master Saenkam for a love charm.

506
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,240
I want a rich husband as well.

507
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,960
It is not that complicated.

508
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,560
You can simply be mine tonight

509
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,920
and be rich right away. Sounds good?

510
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,680
You are only flattering me, Cha.

511
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,960
I know you do not favor me,
since I am older.

512
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,880
Oh, Cha.

513
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,960
Is there only one kind of magical plant?

514
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,560
The plant itself is not important.

515
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,920
The key is the magic from Master Saenkam.

516
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,560
I knew it.
And among the plants you have used,

517
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,480
which ones are the most effective?

518
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,960
There are pandan plants

519
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,880
that are more potent than other kinds.

520
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,240
But they are hard to find.

521
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Master Saenkam kept it
for only the special cases.

522
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,920
Pandan plants?

523
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,280
Yes.

524
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,360
I think

525
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,880
we should get a room

526
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
and get rich together tonight.

527
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,520
- Certainly.
- Come.

528
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,760
- Cha.
- Let us go.

529
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,280
- There they go.
- That is it!

530
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,720
Cha has one tonight.

531
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,080
Take it slow, Cha.

532
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,480
- Do not rush it.
- Whoa.

533
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,560
Pandan plants. No! Pandan plants.

534
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,320
Dear.

535
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,400
Are you feeling well now?

536
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,200
I have asked Master Nandha,
but she said I should ask you myself.

537
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,120
What caused your illness?

538
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,480
Shall we go on a boat ride?

539
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,000
Flowers

540
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,360
bloom to pass on
their lives to the next ones.

541
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,920
That is why flowers
are the most beautiful.

542
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,720
The most beautiful

543
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,320
in such a short time.

544
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,040
They capture everyone's hearts
with their beauty,

545
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,680
and then wither quickly.

546
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,840
To meet and love you,

547
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,480
queen of all the flowers,

548
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,520
is my destiny.

549
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,560
I have not been to this place.

550
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,680
Do you see those bamboo flowers?

551
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,200
The ones you keep in your pocket.

552
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,280
Whenever the bamboo flowers bloom,

553
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,320
it is a sign
that the bamboo grove is dying.

554
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,360
My life is like this bamboo grove.

555
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,160
Once love blooms,

556
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,240
I shall eventually die.

557
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,960
Va.

558
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,640
Dear.

559
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,800
Will the vow you made to your master

560
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,240
curse you to death?

561
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,880
Do not cry, my cozy little soul.

562
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,000
I have chosen.

563
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,200
A hundred victories mean nothing

564
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,520
compared to our lives together.

565
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,400
No, dear.

566
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,520
If you were to die,
how would I go on living?

567
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,640
How would I?

568
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,080
Many souls

569
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,040
were born

570
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,840
only for themselves, not for others.

571
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,280
Their hearts do not bloom
with love for anyone. But I…

572
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,120
I was born to love you.

573
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,320
My life is fulfilled.

574
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,040
All right?

575
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,080
How? When and how will your life end?

576
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,360
It shall not happen soon.

577
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,720
You need not worry.

578
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,360
No, dear.

579
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,920
No. No. No.

580
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,040
Death is always just, Va.

581
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,560
Every life…

582
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,960
shall witness the death of loved ones.

583
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,440
You are not the exception.

584
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,200
Why have you not told me?

585
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,000
If I had known, I would go far,
far away from you.

586
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,040
We would not have become this close.

587
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,240
Why have you not told me?

588
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,920
- Why?
- I have tried to stay far from you.

589
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,960
But the place where love
truly belongs is in our hearts, Va.

590
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,320
Then how can you run away?

591
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,080
Let go of me. I shall not stay anymore.

592
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,520
I must leave…

593
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,720
Let us appreciate
the beauty of these flowers together.

594
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,160
Do not cry.

595
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,640
Live a happy life together for now,

596
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,320
my cozy little soul.

597
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,880
I shall pour this water

598
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,560
to prove
that these pandan plants are consecrated.

599
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,520
If these pandan plants turn black,

600
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,000
you must leave Lady Chavala.

601
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,040
Dear.

602
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,840
Is it possible that we are truly
under a love charm?

603
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,600
Find those who are harmed by Saenkam.

604
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,680
I must let everyone know
that the corrupted is that bastard,

605
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,520
not my daughter!

606
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,640
Khun Saengplarn shall help us, My Lord.

607
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,960
Do you wish for me
to spread the word, sir?

608
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,320
Yes.

609
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,240
The wheels of karma will turn for you.

610
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,520
Noi has come!

611
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,720
Noi is here?!

612
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,440
A ghost cannot report a crime, My Lord?

613
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,840
Yes, it cannot!

614
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,160
Muen Vorachai! You killed me!

615
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,400
A ghost of Noi?!

616
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,360
How could you commit such
a cruel act, killing your own servant?!

617
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,480
Jerm, you are the only one who knows

618
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,080
if it is truly her.

619
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,120
