1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,320
The magic of Pansaeng and Prai

2
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,480
are both condemned dark magic.
We must imprison him.

3
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
-We cannot!
-We cannot!

4
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>I am confined with yantra.</i>

5
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,240
Taen Seenil's yantra.

6
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,440
Why do they not approach?

7
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,720
These are the noble families

8
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
and rich merchants
who are corrupt, My Lord.

9
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
No wonder.

10
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,320
Your name is on the map as well.

11
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Go to Pansaeng's house
and bring them to me.

12
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
What are you doing…?

13
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Here they come.

14
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,440
Ayothaya, my motherland.

15
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,920
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives!

16
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,080
Let us start the new dynasty of Ayothaya.

17
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
We three families shall reign together.

18
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,760
Muen Vorachai

19
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
may not last beyond three days.

20
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Dear…

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,360
Chai.

22
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Chai.

23
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
Va.

24
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes?

25
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
Bring this to Muen Chai.

26
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Chai.

27
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,760
Are you casting a spell?

28
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,600
Chai.

29
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,680
Is this your dying wish?
I cannot hear you.

30
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,920
I am here, brother.

31
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,200
In a short while,

32
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
your sufferings will end.

33
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,480
Chai.

34
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,040
Please forgive me

35
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,480
for any wrongdoing
I have inflicted upon us.

36
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,920
Farewell, brother.

37
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
Chai…

38
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,880
Could you please not leave me?

39
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
Pansaeng is now confined
within Master Taen's magic trap

40
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,960
and unable to wield his dark magic.

41
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,440
Your duty is to kill him…

42
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
with this consecrated knife
from Master Taen.

43
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,640
Yes, My Lord.

44
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
You are hesitant.

45
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,320
I am not.

46
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,040
I chose to serve you.

47
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,240
It is too late for you to change sides.

48
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,240
My soldiers

49
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
are now watching your grandmother
and disabled mother.

50
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,040
No more changing sides.

51
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,280
I shall never betray you, My Lord.

52
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,440
<i>Pansaeng has his magic.</i>

53
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,400
<i>Yet being unconscious</i>
<i>renders him harmless.</i>

54
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,800
<i>I shall sedate everyone.</i>

55
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,680
<i>Go in to slit his throat</i>

56
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,720
<i>and flee.</i>

57
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
Harn.

58
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,680
Do you truly intend to kill me?

59
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
Khun Pakdee
must have readied his men at the gate.

60
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,880
We must fight them off to escape, sir.

61
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,960
Harn.

62
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,480
You must return home
to gather the necessities

63
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,040
and head to Master Yai's monastery.

64
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Master Nandha
has already brought your family there.

65
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,120
You have prepared this.

66
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,120
Did you truly believe
I would not betray you?

67
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,360
I did.

68
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
<i>Do you wish for me</i>
<i>to take care of Harn's family?</i>

69
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,640
<i>What if Harn truly betrays you?</i>

70
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,080
<i>He may assassinate me in here,</i>
<i>or he may not.</i>

71
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
<i>Apart from family, he has no one left.</i>

72
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,040
<i>He had fought alongside me for so long.</i>

73
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,520
<i>I regard his family as my own.</i>

74
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,960
<i>Very well. I must accommodate the elderly</i>

75
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,800
<i>and the sick anyway.</i>

76
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,120
<i>The war is imminent.</i>

77
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
<i>So very considerate of you.</i>

78
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,280
<i>When will you signal me to raid the city?</i>

79
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,960
<i>I shall set the prison on fire</i>
<i>and take you out at once.</i>

80
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,920
<i>No. My escape now would only serve</i>

81
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,920
<i>Luang Bovorntat's agenda</i>
<i>of labeling me a rebel.</i>

82
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,680
<i>I shall be stripped</i>
<i>of my duty and my force.</i>

83
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,040
Harn.

84
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,160
Please forgive me

85
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,160
for my past betrayal, sir.

86
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
Harn.

87
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,960
Harn. Do not do this.

88
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,160
We must go now, sir.

89
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Fire!

90
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,520
Fire! Fire!

91
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,080
The original Dharmachakra records.

92
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,720
I cannot lose the key evidence.

93
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,000
Fire! The royal archive is burning!

94
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,680
The royal archive is ablaze?

95
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,400
The map and Dharmachakra records
are in there. I must go now.

96
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,480
Va.

97
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,000
Va!

98
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
Va!

99
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
Laor!

100
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,440
Saiyud. Saiyud. Aon. Va has gone inside.

101
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
-We must help her.
-My Lady.

102
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,480
-Va!
-Laor, no!

103
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,760
-No, Laor!
-Va!

104
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
Laor! No.

105
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,560
You must go help her, Aon. Saiyud.

106
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,600
-My Lady!
-Va.

107
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
My Lady!

108
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Where are you two going?

109
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,520
Harn.

110
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
You truly did betray me.

111
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,760
Come. Today marks your end!

112
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,960
<i>Your wife has entered the royal archive.</i>

113
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Va.

114
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,000
Where are you going?

115
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,200
Move!

116
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
Come here. You shall face me.

117
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,000
Having fun without me, Harn?

118
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
Yong. I was just thinking of you.

119
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
Go!

120
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,839
Laor!

121
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,720
Ming. Ming! You must save Va!

122
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,000
Va has gone in there, Ming. Ming.

123
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,800
No, Laor. The building
could collapse at any time.

124
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,840
Va!

125
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,840
-My Lady!
-Va!

126
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,600
-My Lady!
-My Lady!

127
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,080
-My Lady!
-My Lady!

128
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,600
-Va!
-My Lady…

129
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,400
-My Lady.
-Is Va inside?

130
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,720
-Sir!
-Yes, sir! The building is collapsing.

131
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
-No, sir!
-Sir, do not go!

132
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
Sir! It is dangerous!

133
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,240
-Let go of me!
-I cannot let you go in there!

134
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,240
-Sir!
-No, sir!

135
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,280
Let go of me.

136
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,680
-Sir.
-You cannot go inside.

137
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,360
Please save yourself for now, sir!

138
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,520
No. I cannot let Va die. Let go!

139
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,480
Sir.

140
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,440
-Sir!
-We cannot let you enter.

141
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,880
-Sir.
-Sir.

142
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,440
Please calm down, sir.

143
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,840
Please think of what
you have been doing for Ayothaya.

144
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,760
Please calm yourself, sir.

145
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,080
Ayothaya needs you!

146
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,040
And what of what I need?

147
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,640
-Let go of me!
-Sir, no!

148
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,800
-Please, sir.
-You cannot go inside!

149
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,000
I cannot let her die.

150
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,520
I should be dying, not her!

151
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
-Sir! Sir.
-Let me go!

152
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,240
-Please, sir!
-Let go of me!

153
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,200
Please compose yourself, sir!

154
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,680
Compose yourself!

155
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,600
-Sir!
-Why are you all holding me back?

156
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Sir.

157
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,720
Why must you torture me?!

158
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,880
Sir…

159
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,960
-My Lady!
-Va!

160
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,080
-Va!
-My Lady!

161
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,880
My Lady…

162
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,600
No. No.

163
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,200
No!

164
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,960
-No!
-Sir.

165
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,640
No!

166
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,640
No…

167
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Va!

168
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,120
-Sir.
-No!

169
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>Were you upset</i>

170
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,400
<i>with my frequent mentions of death?</i>

171
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>Is that why you did this to me?</i>

172
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>You are most cruel.</i>

173
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,800
<i>Why did you leave me by myself?</i>

174
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,480
<i>I was left alone again.</i>

175
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,640
You said that you will become weaker

176
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,800
and eventually…

177
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,880
die not long from now.

178
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,440
Is that still happening?

179
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,560
How beautiful.

180
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,120
It is truly the city of heaven.

181
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,840
Heaven and earth, please bear witness.

182
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,480
I shall give my life to this nation,

183
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
and I shall return home
to see the sun with my husband every day.

184
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
I will never part with Va.

185
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,160
But I am your weakness, dear.

186
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
No, you are my beloved,

187
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,880
my source of willpower,

188
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
and my strength.

189
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,640
I am no longer your burden.

190
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,240
I am not the cause of your death.

191
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,480
I am truly no longer your burden.

192
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,480
You are my strength.

193
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,880
My beloved.

194
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,960
My cozy little soul.

195
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,920
No!

196
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,640
No…

197
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,000
My Lady, why must your time be so short?

198
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
I raised her since she was but a child.

199
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,800
How are we supposed to live now?

200
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,920
My Lady…

201
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,160
The Dharmachakra records

202
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,640
and the map
that we had spent years gathering

203
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,600
went up in flames

204
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
with the leader of the Dharmachakra Order.

205
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,280
I no longer have
the strength to fight, Jom.

206
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,480
The Dharmachakra Order is no more.

207
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
My Lady.

208
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,240
<i>I am at peace with my own death.</i>

209
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,920
<i>Yet the death of my beloved</i>

210
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>wounds me more than I thought.</i>

211
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,280
<i>The greatest misery of this world</i>

212
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
<i>does not come from frailness or death.</i>

213
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>But it is caused</i>
<i>by the departure of those we love.</i>

214
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,280
Is Lady Chavala truly demised?

215
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,240
Has anyone seen her body?

216
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
The whole building collapsed.

217
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,360
Who would survive that?

218
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,440
The customs records and the map
of the corrupt were all burnt to dust.

219
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,880
We no longer need to fear the public.

220
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,760
Pansaeng's men have taken him
out of the city, My Lords.

221
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,040
He must now be disheartened.

222
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,080
We must take this chance
to finish him once and for all.

223
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,120
Yes.

224
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,840
And, as promised,

225
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
both of you, My Lords,

226
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
must now hand me your commander seals.

227
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,840
Here.

228
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,640
You have my thanks, My Lord.

229
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Thank you, My Lord.

230
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,960
The three largest forces

231
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,720
out of all six forces now belong to us.

232
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
Combining them
with your royal police department,

233
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,560
we shall be unstoppable.

234
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,040
<i>He was deeply in love with Lady Chavala.</i>

235
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,240
I would be the same
if that occurred to me.

236
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,400
On our way here,

237
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,360
he had been crying his eyes out.

238
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,280
He cried out Lady Chavala's name.

239
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,000
And he told me

240
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,920
that he no longer wishes to live.

241
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,520
I am truly worried about him.

242
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,800
Please have something, sir.

243
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,560
You have not had any food for days.

244
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,400
Master Nandha told me

245
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,760
it is time for you
to know the truth, my dear brother.

246
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
Come with me.

247
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,920
That night, Master Nandha and I
secretly entered the city

248
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,920
out of worry for you.

249
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,200
I saw Lady Chavala

250
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,320
run into the ablaze building.

251
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,360
Master.

252
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Her breaths are faint.

253
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,520
She must survive, Master.

254
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,120
I cannot bear to see Lady Chavala die.

255
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,520
I never thought
I would use this medicine again.

256
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,240
Get on the boat.

257
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,720
My dear Va.

258
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,760
Dear.

259
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
My dear Va.

260
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,920
Va…

261
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,640
Va.

262
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,000
My dear Va.

263
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
You are not dead…

264
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,520
My cozy little soul.

265
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,560
Master Nandha was not certain

266
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,240
if she could save her life or not,

267
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,880
so she instructed me
to keep this from you.

268
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,720
She is now safe.

269
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,040
My deepest thanks to you, Prai.

270
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,480
Va, I am here for you. Can you hear me?

271
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,680
This is me, Pansaeng. Can you hear me?

272
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,200
Sir. She is awake.

273
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,760
Va.

274
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,080
Va.

275
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,840
-She is awakened, sir.
-Va.

276
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,640
Va.

277
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Easy.

278
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,000
Are you injured somewhere?

279
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Huh? Tell me where it hurts.

280
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,239
I do not know you.

281
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,239
Va.

282
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,800
What are you saying?

283
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,679
What is this place?

284
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:27,679
This is Master Yai's monastery.
We have been here. Do you remember?

285
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,920
How did I end up here?

286
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,040
Do not try to deceive me, Va.

287
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,520
It is me, Pansaeng.

288
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,159
I have missed you so terribly.

289
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,239
-I do not know any of you. Let go of me.
-I am Pansaeng.

290
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,639
-It is Khun Saengplarn and me, Laor.
-Let go of me.

291
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,520
Let go. Who are you?

292
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,520
Let go of her for now, Pansaeng.

293
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
Wait outside, you two.

294
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,480
Yes, Master.

295
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,040
What has happened to Va, Master?

296
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,480
It is the effect of the medicine.

297
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,280
This medicine is called the Unchained.

298
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,560
It originated from
the nunnery of Khao Saming.

299
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,720
Those nuns saved my life.

300
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,880
That was after Master Yai

301
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,680
banished you from the school?

302
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,880
Yes.

303
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,880
I was overwhelmed with hunger and illness

304
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
and almost died
in the woods down the hill.

305
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,320
A nun discovered me

306
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
and made me take this medicine
for seven days and seven nights.

307
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,360
After that, I have survived

308
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,160
but did not remember anything,

309
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,120
not even my name.

310
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,720
And how long
will she be like this, Master?

311
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,480
No one knows for sure.

312
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,080
For me, it took three years.

313
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,960
But the vast majority
never regain their memories.

314
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,280
Va.

315
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,080
What shall I do, Master?

316
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,760
You shall wait.

317
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,720
Your Majesty. Khun Saengplarn

318
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,360
has committed an offense
against the law by escaping from prison.

319
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,640
Under the royal household law,
he is to be stripped of his rank,

320
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
with his house and wealth confiscated.

321
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,640
The rumors about
Khun Saengplarn being a rebel

322
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,840
with Taen Seenil and Prai

323
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,240
providing supports
appear to be true, Your Majesty.

324
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,640
For this reason, anyone
who supports Khun Saengplarn

325
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,960
best cut ties with him.

326
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,040
Otherwise,

327
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,720
they shall be branded rebels as well.

328
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,400
Insolent.

329
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,800
He lied to the king without fear
and unjustly accused me and Jaokhun Kaew.

330
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,880
Myself and Jaokhun Singh

331
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
still believe that Khun Saengplarn

332
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
shall never start
an insurrection, Your Majesty.

333
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,640
It was your plan

334
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,640
to spread false news to confuse
the royal household and the people

335
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,560
and gain advantages over my forces.

336
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,720
The nobles are now divided into factions.

337
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,000
I foresee an impending civil war.

338
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,720
Jaokhun Amorn is not here before the king.

339
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,160
His force has yet to pick a side as well.

340
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Which side will he join?

341
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,760
Jaokhun Amorn, the Chief Minister,

342
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,320
commands the crucial force
that will decide the war.

343
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,520
He is your father-in-law.

344
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,720
Yet why has he not
provided you with support?

345
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,120
He despises me.

346
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,320
He has not allowed me
to see him for years.

347
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,400
Look at my ring. Look. How is it?

348
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,280
-Grandfather.
-What is it?

349
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,800
Muan.

350
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Go.

351
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,960
I want to be with Grandfather.

352
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,640
I want to be with Grandfather.

353
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,400
You despise your son-in-law.
You are partial, Father.

354
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,240
Not only is your husband corrupt,

355
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,480
but he is also planning an insurrection.

356
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,200
Why would I allow
such a vile man to see me?!

357
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,840
He is an heir to the throne of Jinghong.

358
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,480
If he had stayed in the north,

359
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,360
he would have become
the ruler of that region by now.

360
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,440
The true rulers

361
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,960
rule by giving their lives
to protect their nations.

362
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,680
Has he ever protected anyone?!

363
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,960
He constantly acts
as if he is above the law,

364
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,600
exploiting the people's struggles.

365
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,360
Is this who you call a leader?

366
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,280
Jaokhun Singh is no better.

367
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,360
He is only looking to rid himself
of the other families and hold the power.

368
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,840
Then what is wrong

369
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,280
with fighting to protect ourselves?

370
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,120
Nobles were born with the responsibility
to ensure the citizens' well-being.

371
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,560
But your husband
was born to exploit others!

372
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,360
And he should not ever
consider himself a highborn.

373
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,400
Because a highborn with low morals

374
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,560
is not worth the respect of the people.

375
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,000
The map of the corrupt officials

376
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,040
does not appear
to show Jaokhun Amorn's name.

377
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,200
Jaokhun Amorn

378
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,360
tends to speak bluntly,

379
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,840
even if it offends others.

380
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
But in truth, he is honest.

381
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,000
We were misled by his demeanor.

382
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,720
Jaokhun Amorn
must be facing a grave decision.

383
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,720
Should he join us
and we emerge victorious,

384
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,360
Luang Bovorntat,
his wife, and their children

385
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,360
will all face execution.

386
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,600
Will he be at peace with this?

387
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,920
My Lord, I assure you that I shall
only capture Luang Bovorntat alone

388
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,280
without harming your family.

389
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,200
I only ask for your force to join us.

390
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,440
I need more time to decide, My Lord.

391
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,080
I am now standing on the edge.

392
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,440
I must choose between my land

393
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,000
and my family.

394
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,120
Children, should anything happen,

395
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,600
know that

396
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,120
the one who strikes your father
and mother down with a sword

397
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,320
is your own grandfather!

398
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,560
Nuanchawee. You have gone too far.

399
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Give me your commander seal!

400
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,600
You no longer have any choices!

401
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,640
I do believe in you.

402
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
It is now up to you

403
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,360
to find out
if you truly believe in yourself

404
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
and your nation.

405
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,280
You have been picking flowers all day.
What will you do with them?

406
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,120
I wonder so.

407
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,400
Here.

408
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,120
Do you remember

409
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,080
which flowers were used for this?

410
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,920
You were the one

411
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,040
who made this perfume for me

412
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,920
to cure me from nightmares.

413
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,000
It is a symbol of our love.

414
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,640
We were so deeply in love.

415
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,960
We were so in love.

416
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,360
You do remember me, do you not?

417
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,680
You remember me, do you not?

418
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,640
Huh?

419
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,720
Let go of me.

420
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,920
Let go. I said let go.

421
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,800
Do not touch me again.

422
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,960
This morning,
I tried talking to Va to reminisce,

423
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,880
but she acted as if I were a stranger

424
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,840
and did not wish to talk to me.

425
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,320
How long will she behave this way, Master?

426
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,640
If you put too much pressure on her,

427
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,160
it will only lead her
to the path of insanity,

428
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,360
unable to regain her memory forever.

429
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,080
Yes, Master.

430
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,440
I shall no longer rush her to remember.

431
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,120
If even you and Laor fail,

432
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,000
the Dharmachakra Order
will be without hope.

433
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,200
I shall leave this

434
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,920
for Lady Chavala, sir.

435
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,760
Prai.

436
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,880
Trouble has arisen in Ayothaya.

437
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,840
Look.

438
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,160
It is time for the rebels
to raid the city, is it not?

439
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,080
Taen Seenil has come!

440
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Taen Seenil is here. What shall we do?

441
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,600
What shall we do? What now?

442
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,320
The moment we most dreaded is upon us.

443
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,560
We must survive this, my child.

444
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,400
Here.

445
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,680
The key to the safe in my room.

446
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,880
Why are you giving it to me?

447
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,920
I am without parents and any kin.

448
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,440
This war is truly significant.

449
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,720
I am not certain if I shall return.

450
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,640
So, consider it yours.

451
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,560
You must return, Ming. I will think of it

452
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,400
as me safeguarding it for you.

453
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,080
In the past, I went to war

454
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,960
solely for glory.

455
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,560
But now,

456
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,640
I shall go to war for you.

457
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,000
You need not do that much for me.

458
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,120
I know.

459
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,800
But without love, there is no strength.

460
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,640
Only hopeless dreaming

461
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,160
makes me plenty happy.

462
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,960
That is what I think.

463
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,480
I shall take my leave now.

464
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,000
Prai. What is it?

465
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,240
I have calculated an auspicious time

466
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,400
and found that the Star of Death

467
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,880
is currently
gripping Pansaeng's ascendant.

468
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,960
Have you found the same?

469
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,640
Pansaeng is dying in this war

470
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,360
because of his vow.

471
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,720
The Asoraveda of Taen Seenil

472
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,400
is now invincible, defying all opposition.

473
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,640
Can we not do something, Master?

474
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,920
The name of Prai, the great thief,

475
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,120
no longer means anything.

476
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,880
Everywhere I go,

477
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,640
people wish for me to die.

478
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,240
This brother of mine is the sole reason

479
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,640
I keep waking up daily to live my life.

480
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,920
Please do not think that way, Prai.

481
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,800
Should we emerge victorious,

482
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
Ayothaya shall welcome you again.

483
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,360
You must live for Ayothaya.

484
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,080
And I shall preserve this city for you.

485
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Prai.

486
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,360
May Dharma heal your mind.

487
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,160
Pansaeng.

488
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,240
Yes, Master.

489
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,800
Have you calculated your fate?

490
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,960
I have, Master.

491
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,640
With that knowledge,

492
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,120
will you still go to war?

493
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,920
I will, Master.

494
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,080
What of you, Prai?

495
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,040
I certainly will, Master.

496
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,080
Life is not any more
complicated than this.

497
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,200
If we love something,
we shall fight for it.

498
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,720
That is all.

499
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,840
You still do all the same things

500
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,600
as you did at the house.

501
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,360
You wake up at the same time.

502
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,840
You go to see the sun as before.

503
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,680
Your brain may not be aware,

504
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,160
but your heart

505
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,200
still holds our love

506
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,280
and our bond captive.

507
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,760
Bamboo flowers are blooming.

508
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,920
It is time for us to part.

509
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,000
To part?

510
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,760
If you regain your memory after I am gone,

511
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,000
it must be agonizing.

512
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,800
You will be fine this way.

513
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,600
Where is it you are going?

514
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,680
I shall go protect Ayothaya…

515
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,160
for you.

516
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,280
Will you be gone for long?

517
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,200
You will be imprinted upon my soul,

518
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,640
bearing your mark

519
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,040
across every realm and life I inhabit.

520
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,160
Through countless rebirths,

521
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,640
I shall be with you,

522
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,320
never parting,

523
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,600
my cozy little soul.

524
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,480
Charge! Go!

525
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,000
Seal the city gates on every side,
including the inner court.

526
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,880
Have men stationed at every gate!

527
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,200
Yes, My Lord.

528
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,440
I shall go save the king.
You all wait here.

529
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,240
Follow me inside once Prai arrives.

530
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,720
-Let me go with you, sir.
-Taen Seenil may be inside.

531
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,480
You three will not
stand a chance in there.

532
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,000
Wait here until Prai arrives.
This is an order.

533
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,600
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

534
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,400
Where are all the palace guards?

535
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,600
They have cleared the way
for me to fight you.

536
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,320
Bovorntat.

537
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,320
Ming, I cannot move!

538
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,440
We have walked into a trap.

539
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,880
You are holding still for me
to cut you down, one by one.

540
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,200
Easy, boy.

541
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,920
It was my doing.

542
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,120
Jaokhun Singh's company! Fight on!

543
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,400
We have come to protect Ayothaya!

544
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,880
Taen Seenil.

545
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,520
