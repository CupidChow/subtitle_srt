1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
My time is now!

2
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,880
- Let us go!
- We are free!

3
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,400
It shall not be that easy.

4
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,520
Pansaeng.

5
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,160
Kill Khun Saengplarn and join Prai's band!

6
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,200
Jaokhun Singh's company! Fight on!

7
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,040
Fight on!

8
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Enlivened effigies' magic.
Magnificent as people say.

9
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,960
Whoever wishes to kill my son
shall face me first!

10
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
The good you did for this land
is the greatest power you could wield.

11
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Dear. I have been appointed
as the chief customs officer

12
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,160
in place of Chai.

13
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Then you must begin your duty shortly.

14
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Yes.

15
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,360
My lady, this is your customs record.

16
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
And this is Muen Chai's seal.

17
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,600
The first thing you must do is learn

18
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,800
about the seals for each department.

19
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,920
And you must be able
to tell the real from the fake.

20
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Jerm. Did Chai not inspect
these documents at all?

21
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,480
He did not, my lady.
I inspected and stamped all of them.

22
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,960
But you are illiterate.

23
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,240
I am. I merely stamped them
on Muen Chai's command.

24
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,880
Then, it is no wonder

25
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,880
that Luang Bovorntat's illegal caravans
were always allowed through.

26
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,120
It is because Chai never inspected any.

27
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,360
He received bribes
from many of the nobles.

28
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,240
But I do not know who they are.

29
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,320
You destroyed my effigies,

30
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,920
so I shall make new ones.

31
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,680
Your death shall come
before mine, Taen Seenil.

32
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,560
I must avenge my family.

33
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,080
Master.

34
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,400
I am aware
that I have desecrated the sacred vow.

35
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
But please have mercy on me.

36
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,160
For our nation.

37
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,240
For our land.

38
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Ming.

39
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,600
- Greetings, sir.
- Have you waited long?

40
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Since dawn, sir.

41
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,360
Tian told me

42
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,880
you were praying,
so I decided not to bother you.

43
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,880
I only stopped for a meal,
and I shall continue shortly.

44
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
And what is your business?

45
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,960
I have been sober for seven days, sir.

46
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
Do you truly wish to stop drinking?

47
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
Yes, sir.

48
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
You were an orphan.

49
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
I am the one who cares about you the most!

50
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
If you truly like Laor,
you must prove yourself

51
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,480
worthy of having a smart
and kind woman such as her.

52
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,320
I do not have much time left, Ming.

53
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,280
I truly wish to train you in my craft.

54
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,560
I truly wish to change my ways.

55
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I wish to study magic under your tutelage.

56
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Could you accept me as your disciple?

57
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
Come. Stand up.

58
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,320
Begin your meditation today.

59
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,520
Thank you, sir.

60
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,840
It has been three days.
I was about to go to you.

61
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,480
It is fortunate that you came back.

62
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,120
My thoughts were with you.

63
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,200
What is on your mind?

64
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,520
You are smiling.

65
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,120
I am smiling
because you are here before me.

66
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,960
You kept smiling
as you approached death each day.

67
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,120
You are such a brave soul, but…

68
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,840
I cannot do it.

69
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,920
Well…

70
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Could you cut my hair?

71
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,000
But heads are considered sacred,
and you have your magic as well.

72
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
Hey,

73
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
if touching our heads by women
truly causes misfortune,

74
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,680
then our very birth from mothers
would be a curse.

75
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Dear.

76
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,360
Father always let Mother cut his hair
and never believed such a thing.

77
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
So, I wish for you

78
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
to cut my hair as well.
You are the source of my strength

79
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,600
and the compass that guides my life.

80
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,760
You are my sacred being.

81
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,960
Well, well.

82
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,120
I am merely your terrible brother
and a drunkard. That is why I am ignored.

83
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,280
I am now left to drink
and enjoy women alone.

84
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,440
You wicked brother!

85
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,640
Yong. Do not condemn him.

86
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,760
You yourself are too weak
to do what he does.

87
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,520
Well, Harn, Khun Saengplarn has taught me
swordplay to master in three days.

88
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
He spoke of his coming death again.

89
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,920
And I must recite the Art of War
and be tested by him tomorrow.

90
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,160
How is he meant to fight as a soldier
if he keeps dwelling on death?

91
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,320
Ever since his effigies were destroyed,
he truly has changed.

92
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
What must we do then?

93
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
I do not know.

94
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
If Prai is joining an insurrection
as people say,

95
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,560
our land is doomed, Harn.

96
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,400
Your work is impressive.

97
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,840
Have you done it before?

98
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,960
No, dear.

99
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,720
But Father let Mother
cut his hair as well.

100
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Mother would make a great effort,

101
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,400
and I would watch and learn from her.

102
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,800
It is fortunate that we were both
brought up by loving spouses.

103
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,400
The same goes for the two of us.

104
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,760
Dear.

105
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,520
If I truly am your compass,

106
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,200
could you give me your word on one matter?

107
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
Certainly.

108
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,160
When you go to war,

109
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,560
have you fled from any battles?

110
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
I have not.

111
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,680
From now on,

112
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,320
could you flee?

113
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,120
Flee from battles?

114
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,680
- Huh?
- Dear.

115
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Could you promise me

116
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,560
not to let vengeance be your goal

117
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,720
and not to gamble with your honor?

118
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,840
Could you retreat,

119
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,000
surrender, and flee when you must?

120
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,640
I have not done any of it probably because

121
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,800
I was consumed by the need for victory.

122
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,160
And more importantly,

123
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,080
back then,

124
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,320
I had no one waiting for me at home.

125
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
But now,

126
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,880
you have one, dear.

127
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,720
Family is not only our compass,

128
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,440
but they are the reminder
in our minds as well.

129
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
Right.

130
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,920
Very well. I promise.

131
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,240
Then, from now on,

132
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,640
if victory is not guaranteed,

133
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,440
I shall retreat.

134
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,960
Really?

135
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,040
You have my thanks, dear.

136
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,160
Khun Saengplarn! Sir!

137
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,640
Tian.

138
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
Sir!

139
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,000
Trouble has arisen, sir!

140
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,160
Prai has robbed Ban Tha Din Daeng!

141
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,440
Harn's village?

142
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,680
Yes, sir.

143
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,200
Most were killed. They say
that Harn's family did not survive!

144
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,320
Mother!

145
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Mother!

146
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Mother! I am here!

147
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,680
Mother! Mother.

148
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Harn.

149
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Yong.

150
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,800
The wagon is here.
I shall bring your mother to the healer.

151
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,760
Soldiers! Bring the injured to the wagon!

152
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,160
- Now!
- Hurry! Hurry.

153
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
Come, Yoi.

154
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,440
- Care for her, Yong.
- To the wagon.

155
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
Father.

156
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
Father!

157
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,480
Father! Father!

158
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
Help! Help me!

159
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,800
They are here to kill me!

160
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,000
- I am scared! Help!
- Grandmother! It is me!

161
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,000
They are here to kill us!

162
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,640
Grandmother! It is me! This is Harn!

163
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,280
- They are killing us all.
- They are gone, Grandmother!

164
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,520
They are all gone.
They are gone, Grandmother.

165
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
- There are fewer than ten survivors.
- Huh?

166
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
More wagons are coming.
Let soldiers take the injured away.

167
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,240
- Harn.
- They are gone.

168
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,120
I am scared.

169
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,960
My father has passed, sir.

170
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,520
And my mother has a cut wound on her leg.

171
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,920
They are killing me! I am scared!

172
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,840
Grandmother!

173
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,880
- Grandmother!
- I am scared!

174
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,080
- Grandmother! It is fine now.
- Sir.

175
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,280
Grandmother Fang has gone insane.

176
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,320
My child…

177
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
- Let us go to the healer.
- My daughter has been raped.

178
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,800
The leader.

179
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,880
That Prai! He violated my daughter.

180
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,520
He is worse than any monster in hell!

181
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,840
Sir.

182
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,920
Did you not say that your school
forbade any ties with women?

183
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
And what is this?

184
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
Prai must truly
pledge himself to Taen Seenil,

185
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,760
since he disobeys your master.

186
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,080
Sir, I can no longer stand here!

187
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,880
We must hunt them down!
They will not be far!

188
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
Go.

189
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,800
They are now camping.

190
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,480
Go, pay respect to Prai.

191
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,880
Greetings, sir.

192
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,560
Here.

193
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,760
Prai's magical rope.

194
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,320
The sacred item for invulnerability.

195
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,120
Go have your meal!
We shall have a long journey tomorrow.

196
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,920
Yes.

197
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,120
All of you. We have new faces among us.

198
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Young men from the city.

199
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,040
More have joined their band.

200
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,840
With how rough their lives are,

201
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,400
it is wiser to become
even a thief than a beggar.

202
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,560
<i>Why do the ropes have different colors?</i>

203
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
We shall tail them

204
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,160
until we find their den

205
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,120
and return to bring our men.

206
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,520
Then, I volunteer for this task.

207
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Very well.

208
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,400
Once you see them begin their journey,

209
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,280
report to me at once.

210
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Yes, sir.

211
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
Come.

212
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,680
- Greetings.
- Come.

213
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,880
Please take care of us.

214
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,640
Have it.

215
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,240
- The fish is cooked well now.
- Oh.

216
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
I want some bananas.

217
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,200
Sir! Sir.

218
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Harn.

219
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,720
Prai is going up the hill to pray alone.

220
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,240
If we take this chance,
the four of us shall corner him.

221
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
We shall not.

222
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,080
We only wish to know where their den is

223
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
and bring our men
to destroy them once and for all.

224
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,000
- Keep watching them.
- You do not wish to kill him

225
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,320
since he is
your beloved senior, is that it?!

226
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,920
He is not, Harn.

227
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,760
Sir, Prai has completely changed.

228
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,960
He is no longer your senior disciple!

229
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,320
He is a monster who delights in killing!

230
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,040
Sir.

231
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Please help me kill him

232
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,280
to cleanse me of my vengeance!

233
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,760
Sir, please help Harn.

234
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,920
They are part of an insurrection.

235
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,560
I shall risk my life killing them

236
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,880
to keep Ayothaya safe.

237
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>Could you promise me</i>

238
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,400
not to let vengeance be your goal

239
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,240
and not to gamble with your honor?

240
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,280
Could you retreat,

241
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,960
surrender, and flee when you must?

242
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,600
No.

243
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
We shall not face them directly.

244
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,520
This is not you at all.

245
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,360
- The love for your wife changed you.
- Yong.

246
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,720
Please forgive me.

247
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Trust me, Harn.

248
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
The best tactic stated in the Art of War

249
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
that should be used the most

250
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
is to retreat.

251
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,600
We must be safe first.

252
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,240
Yes.

253
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
Keep watching.

254
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,000
Stick to the original plan.

255
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,240
Tail them till we find their den

256
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,560
and bring them down with our men.

257
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Prai…

258
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,680
Do not do this, Harn.

259
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
Let go of me.

260
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,320
No. Do not do this, Harn.

261
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
I shall kill him!

262
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,640
- Harn. No!
- Let go!

263
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
Harn. Harn.

264
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,160
You have disobeyed my order!
You pursued him despite my warning!

265
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,440
Why?

266
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,760
Did you wish
to meet your father that quickly?!

267
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,440
Sir, I have checked thoroughly.

268
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,560
It was different from when you meditate.

269
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,000
During your meditation,
are your senses usually not heightened?!

270
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,200
I have fought Prai countless times.

271
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
Prai's magic is truly powerful. Harn,

272
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,040
you will not stand a chance.

273
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,800
Do you respect him that much?!

274
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,080
This senior from your magic school!

275
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,480
You favor Prai even more than me.

276
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
You are disregarding
my vengeance against him,

277
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,240
even after years of battles

278
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,280
that I risked my life alongside you!

279
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,480
You refused to help me!

280
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,320
You do not understand my sorrow at all!

281
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,640
Harn. Calm down.

282
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,720
If dozens of your family and kin

283
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,560
have been slaughtered like mine,

284
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
would you still be calm, Ming?!

285
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
I was born to be a soldier

286
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,000
and rose to the rank of Muen!

287
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,320
I have saved hundreds of people!

288
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,480
Yet I could not save my parents

289
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,680
and any of my kin!

290
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,920
Why would I become a soldier?!

291
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,680
Why would I continue to be?!

292
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,560
Harn.

293
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,320
Dear.

294
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,640
Your safe return

295
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,880
is the only thing I have been waiting for.

296
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,480
I have done what you asked, and my men…

297
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,920
said that I was blinded by love.

298
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,800
Someone like you is not easily blinded.

299
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,960
Your decisions
are guided by your mindfulness.

300
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,800
I am truly sorry for Harn.

301
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,920
I have lived through that life before.

302
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,960
My parents.

303
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
My sibling.

304
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,080
My kin.

305
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,600
They all died.

306
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
There was no one left.

307
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,240
I fled into the woods.

308
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,360
I came to Ayothaya.

309
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,520
People are all scared.

310
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,640
Tha Din Daeng is Ayothaya's frontier.

311
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,960
And it was destroyed today.

312
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,720
Next time, they must invade the capital.

313
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,600
Hey.

314
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,240
Do not dwell
only on the thought of my death.

315
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,840
Every one of us

316
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,600
is being chased by death.

317
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
If today

318
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,520
we still have time to embrace,

319
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
then embrace each other.

320
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,360
If we still have time to…

321
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,520
Was it truly a kiss?

322
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,800
It was terrible.

323
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,760
If death does us part,

324
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,000
in every lifetime,

325
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,159
please remember in your heart and soul

326
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,760
that I…

327
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,840
love you…

328
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,159
and I shall always be by your side.

329
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,640
Greetings, Bua.

330
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,600
I am here to visit you and Harn.

331
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,280
Harn is caring for his mother.

332
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,200
And how is Yoi doing?

333
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,480
She survived,
but she may no longer be able to walk.

334
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,960
- Help me! Help! Thieves are coming!
- Great-grandmother!

335
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,520
- They are here to kill me!
- Great-grandmother! No!

336
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,720
- No! Help!
- Great-grandmother! There is no one!

337
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,840
- Great-grandmother!
- They will kill me!

338
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,440
- I am scared!
- Please!

339
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,560
- No!
- I am here. I am here for you.

340
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,400
Bua.

341
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,360
Must she be tied with ropes?

342
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,200
This morning, she grabbed an axe in panic
and was about to slash other people.

343
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,560
Do you wish for me to help with anything?

344
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,640
Thank you for the gifts.

345
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,960
But you should leave.
Our trouble shall only distress you.

346
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Bua.

347
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,520
No! Stop!

348
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,040
Anyone!

349
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,960
- They are here to kill me!
- There is no one.

350
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,200
- No one is here to hurt you.
- Help me!

351
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,360
I am scared!

352
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,880
They say that the effigies were destroyed.

353
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,320
Khun Saengplarn no longer has any magic.

354
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,360
Those who fight under him
can expect certain death.

355
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,480
He refused to face Prai

356
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
and fled in a cowardly manner.

357
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,960
Harn is hurt by his loss being ignored.

358
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,720
What kind of leader is he?
He must fear death as well.

359
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,480
His magic actually
forbids him from taking a wife.

360
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,520
Yet once he has a wife,
he is blinded by love.

361
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,440
They should separate.
If I were him, I would leave her

362
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,760
and save my own life first. Lady Chavala
is wise. How could she not do anything?

363
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,840
It is impossible for her not to know.

364
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,040
Even we know about this.

365
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,960
Being with her shall only bring him down.

366
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,080
He should be leaving.
Why can he not realize?

367
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,800
- Let us go.
- Yes.

368
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,680
- Get out!
- Do not hit me! It hurts!

369
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,680
- Go away!
- It hurts!

370
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,720
- Go! Go away!
- It hurts!

371
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,960
- You madman!
- Do not hurt me.

372
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,480
- Hey! Stay away from this place!
- It hurts.

373
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,880
You smell like something died!

374
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,760
It hurts!

375
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
- Stop hitting me!
- Go somewhere else!

376
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,200
Stop! What are you doing?

377
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
Stop!

378
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,120
Help me!

379
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,160
This madman was in the temple,
disturbing the visitors.

380
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,720
He only wanted to pray.

381
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,640
Why must you hurt him this bad?

382
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,440
He is insane!
He is constantly threatening people.

383
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,640
They feared he would harm them,
so they beat him.

384
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
- You madman!
- Hey!

385
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,720
- Go away!
- You madman.

386
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,080
- Va.
- It hurts.

387
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,240
It hurts!

388
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,720
Hey. Hey.

389
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,480
You need not fear me.

390
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,200
Do you wish to stay at our home?

391
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,400
Va.

392
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,360
No. Do not do this.

393
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,920
Hey.

394
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,280
I shall have someone treat your wounds.

395
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,080
If I leave you here, you shall die
from your injury. Let us go.

396
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,600
- No, I will not go!
- No, Va.

397
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,440
- I must pray. I want to meditate and pray!
- Yes, yes.

398
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,040
- I know. Calm down.
- I want to pray!

399
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,520
- Let me pray!
- Hey, listen to me! Listen!

400
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,240
I understand you now.
I know what you want.

401
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,000
You must go eat something
and take some medicine.

402
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,720
After a few days, you are free
to go anywhere you wish.

403
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,280
Please.

404
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
I shall apply some ointment.

405
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,840
Here, Va.

406
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,080
It shall hurt only a bit.

407
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,560
You are beautiful.

408
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,160
Aunruean.

409
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,000
Truly beautiful…

410
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Hey, Tian!

411
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,640
You! Know your place!

412
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,000
Her husband will kill you.

413
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,480
Lower your gaze. Do not look at her.

414
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,680
This man cannot be trusted.

415
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,040
Please let me treat his wounds myself.

416
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,360
You should stay away from him, my lady.

417
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,920
Hey.

418
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,000
Do you see this?
Lower your eyes and do not look.

419
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
Let us be done and have a meal.

420
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,200
Lower your gaze and do not look up.

421
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,360
Here. I shall do it myself.

422
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,840
Move away, Va. Tian.

423
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,040
Take care of him.

424
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,440
Apply more.

425
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,800
More on here. There you go. Here.

426
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,040
- There!
- He shall heal faster.

427
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,800
This arm as well. Here.

428
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,720
- There.
- Apply it all.

429
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,520
Hey, be gentle. Do it like this.

430
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,800
- Follow my lead.
- No. We shall do it ourselves.

431
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,600
Pray.

432
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,320
‪Pray.

433
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,360
Buddha images?

434
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,760
Pray to the Buddha.

435
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,480
Enlivened effigies.

436
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,840
This place… This place…

437
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,800
This place… It is…

438
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,960
‪Buddha.

439
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Home.

440
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,280
Aunruean.

441
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,960
Are you hungry?

442
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,920
Aunruean, my dear.
My thoughts were always with you.

443
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,040
- Let go of me.
- Aunruean, my dear wife.

444
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,080
- Let go! Let go! Help!
- Aunruean, I love you!

445
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,640
- Anybody, help! Let go!
- Aunruean!

446
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,440
Too loud! It is too loud!

447
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,440
It is too loud!

448
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,840
- Master Nandha! Please help!
- It is too loud! It hurts!

449
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,160
Stop! I told you to stop!

450
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,920
This lady is not your wife.

451
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,000
My name is Nandha.

452
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,280
I have been searching my mind for you.

453
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,040
Compose yourself.

454
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,480
Bring back your awareness, Prai.

455
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,960
My name is Prai.
I am known as Master Prai.

456
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,600
Prai?

457
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,360
Stop!

458
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,600
<i>Buddho…</i>

459
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,680
Dear!

460
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,160
Prai.

461
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,040
Do you remember me?

462
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,040
We were under the same master.

463
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,800
You are…

464
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,960
Prai.

465
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,800
Prai.

466
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,880
Is this Prai who robbed Harn's village?

467
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,600
Then how did he become insane?

468
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,920
That man is an imposter.

469
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,800
This one is the real Prai.

470
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,600
I cannot find the reason

471
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,160
why that imposter
has the same face and demeanor as him.

472
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,520
It is Asoraveda,
the magic of shapeshifting.

473
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,800
It is the highest form of dark magic.

474
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,360
The only one on earth who mastered it

475
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,440
is Taen Seenil.

476
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,920
Does that mean

477
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,960
Prai, who has been raiding villages,

478
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,920
is Taen Seenil in disguise?

479
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,040
This man, the real Prai,

480
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,800
broke out from prison after his wife died

481
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,560
and became insane.

482
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,880
He wanders everywhere

483
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,160
and does not even remember his name.

484
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,120
Taen Seenil

485
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,320
then assumed Prai's identity.

486
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,680
Taen Seenil plans to use Prai's name

487
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,240
to gather his forces faster.

488
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,160
If his name was used
for terrible offenses,

489
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,560
- it is not fair for him, dear.
- Va. Va.

490
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,000
This Prai is a madman.

491
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,200
I have a formula
for those in this condition.

492
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,880
But it shall take time

493
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,040
before he fully recovers.

494
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,760
Then,

495
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,440
I shall take him to the raft house.

496
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,040
Uh…

497
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,760
Will you stay with us as well, Master?

498
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes. I heard your effigies were destroyed.

499
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,640
Once Prai recovers, perhaps

500
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,320
the three of us can focus our minds

501
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,520
to empower the enlivened effigies,

502
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,040
so they shall be ready
to protect our land.

503
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Drink this

504
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,440
and meditate. Without distractions,

505
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,880
your focus shall emerge.

506
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,840
Then, your memories shall return.

507
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,200
We heard you have had
a big argument with Pansaeng.

508
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,560
His blind obsession with his wife

509
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,960
has weakened his magic.

510
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,600
Your leader is dying.
Why would you stay by his side?

511
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,240
Well…

512
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,120
I have fought alongside him
for so long, My Lord.

513
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,760
I cannot abandon him.

514
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,440
But he abandoned your family.

515
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,160
He did not avenge them
and even ignored your grief.

516
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,440
Muen Harn.

517
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,040
Join me.

518
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,640
- Join you, my lord?
- Yes.

519
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,760
If you join me,
I shall promote you to a Khun.

520
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,280
That way, you shall lead
your own men to destroy Prai.

521
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, there is nothing to think about.

522
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,080
Staying with a weak man

523
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,920
shall only lead to death.

524
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,480
I will consider it, my lord.

525
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,720
Prai.

526
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,360
Do you remember me?

527
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,640
The yantra ink

528
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,120
of an eight-pointed star.

529
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,280
Pansaeng.

530
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,760
Your name is Pansaeng.

531
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,320
Your medicine is truly potent.

532
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,280
And this lady…

533
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,400
Who is she?

534
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,000
She is not Aunruean.

535
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,240
Aunruean has passed.

536
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,920
This is Lady Chavala, Prai.
She is my wife.

537
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,440
You must bother her no more

538
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,760
because she is not Aunruean.

539
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,720
Do I have your word?

540
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Yes.

541
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,080
You have my word.

542
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,520
Aunruean has truly died.

543
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,560
Aunruean has died.

544
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,840
Cry it out

545
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,080
if your heart cannot bear the pain.

546
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,720
If your mind tries to escape,
you shall be far from reality.

547
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,440
Master.

548
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,440
My wife has died.

549
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,480
How am I supposed to live now?

550
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,320
Cry it all out.

551
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,360
If you still
do not admit your pain and loss,

552
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,920
you shall not be able to move on.

553
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,680
Aunruean.

554
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,920
Aunruean, my dear wife!

555
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,880
Aunruean.

556
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,280
I brought sun-dried squid for you.
Fry them and eat with rice porridge.

557
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,600
These are expensive.

558
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,960
Thank you.

559
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,360
Where? Where is he?

560
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,440
Thong! You again.

561
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,600
Ming. What are you doing here?
Do not lay your hands on Thong.

562
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,760
Forgive me, Thong.

563
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,800
- What?
- What?

564
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,360
I, Ming, have realized my mistake.

565
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,160
The way I disrespected you last time

566
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,000
was wrong. Please forgive me, Thong.

567
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,720
Is that voice necessary?

568
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,040
Lately, I have been
praying and meditating.

569
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,920
So, this is my voice now.

570
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,760
I was only joking.

571
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,800
But I do apologize.

572
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,360
You as well, Laor.

573
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,240
Oh. Your house is truly tidy.

574
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,240
I told you I have changed.

575
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,440
I am the new Ming.

576
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,000
Oh, has Khun Saengplarn
begun your magic training?

577
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,080
What have you learned?
Can you disappear at will?

578
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,680
My best lesson learned is to regain focus.

579
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,160
During my meditation,

580
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,320
I was able to reflect on my life goal.

581
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,240
Thank you for scolding me, Laor.

582
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,080
Your insults

583
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,760
have opened my eyes.

584
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,560
I have insulted you?

585
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,080
When?

586
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,720
Perhaps I was too blunt. Forgive me.

587
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,320
It is fine.

588
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
Well,

589
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,120
there is something

590
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,840
I am not sure if I should tell you.

591
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,560
I truly wish

592
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,480
for you to scold me again.

593
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,320
Keep scolding me

594
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,560
for the rest of my life.

595
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,920
Ugh. I told you
I did not mean to scold you.

596
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,680
Whatever. Siblings should always
reprimand each other anyway.

597
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,600
Well, not as siblings.

598
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,720
I wish for something
a little more intimate.

599
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,560
Perhaps cooking for me.

600
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,480
We take care of each other

601
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,480
with you being my wife.

602
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,880
- Ming!
- Hey, wait.

603
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,680
You have filthy thoughts again.

604
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,600
- Wait. Were you about to kick me?
- Because you…

605
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,320
Is that what you think of me?

606
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,600
When has it begun? Was it long?

607
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,200
Uh, I have for a while.

608
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,280
But could you not see me along with Thong?

609
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,280
You can eventually choose the better man.

610
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,040
Well.

611
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,920
Can I

612
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,000
compete with Thong for you?

613
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,960
Well, you can think it through then.

614
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,360
- Please let me inspect. Which department?
- Yes.

615
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,800
The Ministry of the Capital sends this
to the governor Mueang Chakangrao.

616
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,720
What is it, Va?

617
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,840
- No. It was nothing, Laor. Here.
- Yes.

618
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,400
- Passage fee, Officer.
- Yes.

619
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,360
What are the goods,
and where is the destination?

620
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,480
They are rice from Bang Khla
for a Chinese merchant in a nearby market.

621
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,920
- Wait a moment. I shall issue a receipt.
- Yes.

622
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,720
Here.

623
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,600
CUSTOMS RECORD

624
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Laor, whose record is this?

625
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,160
How did it end up here?

626
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,280
It was not here when we arrived.

627
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,560
CUSTOMS OFFICER

628
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,640
<i>Do you know</i>

629
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,920
what Dharmachakra

630
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,880
truly symbolizes?

631
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
I do, Father.

632
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,880
It is the wheel of Dharma
that keeps turning.

633
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,600
In the dark days, we shall wait.
When the time comes, we fight villainy.

634
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,400
In the end, Dharma shall prevail.

635
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,480
There must be something
behind this symbol.

636
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,840
What is it?

637
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,440
You were the reason
the effigies were destroyed.

638
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,640
You are merely a burden to my brother,
who is dying because of you!

639
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,320
You are the only one who can help me.

640
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,480
Capture him.

641
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,720
What is this, my lord?

642
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,280
You are a rebel, are you not?

643
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,560
Hey! Who is that?! I said stop!

644
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,360
Who are these people?

645
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,440
Fire.

646
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,800
My power of the sun, to me!

647
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,960
Where are you lot going?!

648
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
- There are two Masters.
- I am the real Prai.

649
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,520
The soldiers of the Ministry
of the Treasury is now mine.

650
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,040
Let the lanterns
of the Dharmachakra shine bright.

651
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,320
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives.

652
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,120
<i>May the love for our land</i>

653
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,120
strengthen my spirit. I must not die.

654
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,120
