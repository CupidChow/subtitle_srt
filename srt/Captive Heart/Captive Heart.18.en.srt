1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,680
Mother! Mother! I am here!

2
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
- Harn.
- They are gone.

3
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
They are now camping.

4
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,680
Prai has completely changed.

5
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
He is no longer your senior disciple!

6
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,640
We shall not face them directly.

7
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,360
This is not you at all.
The love for your wife changed you.

8
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
Prai's magic is truly powerful.

9
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
You will not stand a chance.

10
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
If you join me,

11
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
I shall promote you to a Khun.

12
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,040
That way, you shall lead your own men
to destroy Prai.

13
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
Dear!

14
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,160
Is this Prai who robbed Harn's village?

15
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,680
That man is an imposter.

16
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,040
This one is the real Prai.

17
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,120
This is Lady Chavala, Prai.

18
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
She is my wife.
You must not bother her anymore.

19
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,080
This brother

20
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,520
shall help you.

21
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I shall meditate and focus my energy

22
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,360
into these enlivened effigies.

23
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
What?!

24
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
Nothing is happening.

25
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Worthless! I am completely worthless!

26
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,160
Some entries were stamped
with the Dharmachakra seal.

27
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
But some entries were not.

28
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
What does this mean?

29
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,760
You must die. You were the reason
the effigies were destroyed.

30
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,600
You have weakened my brother's magic.

31
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,360
You were the reason! You were the reason!

32
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
It was all because of you!

33
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,120
Let me go.

34
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
If you die,

35
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Pansaeng, my brother,
shall regain his powerful magic.

36
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
You are merely a burden to my brother,

37
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,800
who is dying because of you!

38
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
Die!

39
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
If she continues to stay beside you,

40
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,920
your magic shall only be weakened further.

41
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,200
<i>I wish to be happy,</i>
<i>as other husbands and wives do.</i>

42
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>Yes.</i>

43
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,960
<i>A burden.</i>

44
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
<i>I am merely a burden.</i>

45
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>It is good that I die.</i>

46
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
<i>Farewell, my dear.</i>

47
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,040
<i>I shall have to leave you now.</i>

48
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,400
<i>I wish to have her by my side</i>

49
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,000
every minute I have left.

50
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,320
That is my greatest wish, My Lord.

51
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,360
My Lady. Wake up. Wake up.

52
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
- My Lady.
- You wicked madman.

53
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,800
Va took you in and fed you meals,

54
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,040
yet you dared to hurt her.

55
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
Do you wish to stay with us?

56
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,960
You must eat something
and take some medicine.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,240
It shall hurt only a bit.

58
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
You are beautiful.

59
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes.

60
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
The beautiful lady.

61
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,280
The beautiful lady who helped me.
I cannot harm her.

62
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
My Lady! My Lady!

63
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,920
My Lady, wake up.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Wake up. Please wake up.

65
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
- My Lady.
- Tian…

66
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
My Lady.

67
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,600
Please forgive me! Please!

68
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,960
- Stay away!
- Please forgive me!

69
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,720
- Do not ever touch her!
- Get out!

70
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Go away. Leave this house at once.

71
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,240
And may we never see you again. Go!

72
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,360
- My Lady!
- I said go!

73
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
- Forgive me! Not again!
- Go away!

74
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,440
- My Lady!
- Get out!

75
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,840
- Please forgive me!
- Go away!

76
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,560
- My Lady! My Lady!
- Go! Leave!

77
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,360
- Go away!
- My Lady! Please forgive me!

78
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,520
My Lady!

79
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
My Lady…

80
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Va.

81
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
- Are you injured?
- No…

82
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,600
- My Lady.
- Were any of you harmed?

83
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,000
Are you truly not hurt?

84
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,760
My Lady.

85
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Master.

86
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,280
Master Nandha.

87
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Master Nandha.

88
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Master Nandha.

89
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
Please help me.

90
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,840
You are the only one who can help me.

91
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
What Prai said was right.

92
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,480
I am only a burden to Khun Seangplarn.

93
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,120
If I decide to ordain,
he shall be able to move on

94
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
and finish the new effigies.

95
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
Love is held in your heart.

96
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,240
The clerical robe
is nothing more than attire.

97
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,760
It shall not remove your love.

98
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
Then,

99
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,720
must I run away from him?

100
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,080
Pansaeng will then become disheartened

101
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,640
and squander more time searching for you.

102
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,760
And must I let his death approach him?

103
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,640
Must he die because of me?

104
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,280
Even if you die,

105
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,080
everything shall stay the same.

106
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Perhaps Pansaeng
will become insane, like Prai.

107
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
There is only one way

108
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,680
you can resolve this.

109
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,800
What is it, Master?

110
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,680
Accept the life you have

111
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
as it is.

112
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,160
You have been trying to dictate your life

113
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
to be what you want.

114
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
You have fought hard for what you wanted.

115
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,920
Failure to attain it
has left you in agony.

116
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,120
If we were not meant to fight,

117
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,160
then what is
the true purpose of our lives?

118
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,200
To be happy.

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,760
Feel the wind

120
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,840
and the trees around us.

121
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
They are encouraging you to be happy.

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,960
For those you cannot control,

123
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
you must let go

124
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,080
and always put
your heart at ease, my child.

125
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,560
Va is seeing Master Nandha, sir.

126
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,200
She will stay
and practice Dharma with her tonight.

127
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,320
Va asked me to tell you
not to worry about her.

128
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,400
And what of Prai?

129
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
He is no longer here, sir.

130
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,280
He asked Lady Va
for forgiveness and ran away.

131
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,920
Sheltering a madman such as him
shall only bring us trouble.

132
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
We should let him go, sir.

133
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,760
<i>Prai created this consecrated item.</i>

134
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
<i>It was infused with his power.</i>

135
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,880
<i>Prai.</i>

136
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,680
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

137
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
Why?!

138
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,960
Why am I still not dead?

139
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
The day we met…

140
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,840
<i>I was but a little orphan.</i>

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,160
<i>I was the last of my kin. You…</i>

142
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,400
were the best amongst us.

143
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,080
<i>You helped with my training.</i>

144
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,120
<i>You were the leader.</i>

145
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>You were our big brother at the school.</i>

146
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,560
That's why

147
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
you became Master Prai,

148
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,400
the most notorious thief.

149
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,200
And you became a civil servant.

150
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,840
The two of us

151
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,920
truly walk different paths.

152
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
No one cherishes me anymore.

153
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,920
I have no one left.

154
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,880
But you have me,

155
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,040
your beloved brother.

156
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,360
Many defenseless citizens are being
slaughtered by the rebels in the city.

157
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
You must live for me

158
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,880
and those people in need.

159
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,440
Very well.

160
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,560
I shall live for you.

161
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,520
From now on,

162
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,080
you shall live a new life
and fight for every defenseless citizen.

163
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,600
Yes.

164
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
I shall no longer be an animal.

165
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
I shall be a good man.

166
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,280
Prai.

167
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,880
For you.

168
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
For Ayothaya.

169
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Chai.

170
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
The flu is becoming widespread.

171
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,960
You must be careful.

172
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,520
I plan to submit a request
to the authority.

173
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,599
If you sleep on a warm mattress,
your condition may improve.

174
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,800
I am not familiar with you being quiet

175
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
and not scolding me.

176
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,560
Brother.

177
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
Will my love

178
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
ever break the wall
you have built in your heart, Chai?

179
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
By the way.

180
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,360
The other day,

181
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,840
someone left me the records
with Dharmachakra stamps.

182
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
I could not understand any of it.

183
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,880
What does Dharmachakra

184
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,080
truly mean?

185
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,960
When you were the customs officer,

186
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,840
did you ever receive such records?

187
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
Perhaps I have spoken too much.

188
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
I shall take my leave.

189
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,040
Father said

190
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,440
that this seal is truly important.

191
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,840
What is its importance?

192
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
I am not certain.

193
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,040
In the study,

194
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
there is a wooden box kept in a safe.

195
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,160
There's something inside.

196
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,880
Look for it.

197
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,720
Yes.

198
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,840
<i>In the study,</i>

199
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,400
<i>there is a wooden box kept in a safe.</i>

200
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,160
Greetings, My Lord.

201
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,800
‪-Capture him.
‪-What is this, My Lord?

202
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,160
There are rumors that you are a rebel.

203
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,320
A loyal noble such as I was concerned.

204
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,800
So, I sent my men to inspect

205
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,280
your storage facility outside the city.

206
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,200
Well,

207
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,840
what have you found? Tell Luang Bovorntat.

208
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,840
In the storage facility in Ban Khwae Yai,

209
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
we found steel and swords,

210
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,840
My Lord.

211
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,800
Having amassed this many weapons,

212
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,480
you are a rebel,

213
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,360
are you not?

214
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,360
No, My Lord.

215
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,560
You have gravely misunderstood me.

216
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,760
Those goods
were stocked for sale, My Lord.

217
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,640
For sale?

218
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,680
But it is against the law, is it not?

219
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
You are well aware of that.

220
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,440
My Lord.

221
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,960
May I discuss something with you?

222
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,520
Is one out of ten
portions of profit enough?

223
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,600
Who do you think I am?

224
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,760
Are you attempting to offer me a bribe?

225
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,720
My Lord.

226
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,600
We are no strangers.
You have helped me once before.

227
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,280
But our nation was not in such chaos.

228
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,840
Three out of ten portions.
Do we have a deal, My Lord?

229
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,960
I desire to be in a certain position.

230
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I shall ask that side
the way I have asked you.

231
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,560
We shall see who can offer me more.

232
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,800
And the forces
of the Ministry of the Treasury

233
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,960
will join that side.

234
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,640
What position

235
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,000
do you set your eyes on, My Lord?

236
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,000
You are still young.

237
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,120
You need a senior
such as me to protect you.

238
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
I wish to become king.

239
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,920
- You!
- Do you dare refuse?!

240
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,160
Do not forget that my family

241
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,080
owns all the trade routes of Ayothaya.

242
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,160
The new dynasty
shall be the wealthiest because of me!

243
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,880
Hear this.

244
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,680
I shall name you the crown prince.

245
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,200
Together, we shall hold the power.
Is it enough?

246
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,080
It is not, My Lord.

247
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
You must

248
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
give me your commander seal
as collateral as well.

249
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
A commander seal is too important.

250
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,720
I can give it to no one.

251
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
Taen Seenil and Prai
are waiting to strike out there.

252
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,360
My side will surely prevail.

253
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,000
Imagine yourself becoming the king.

254
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Together, we shall hold the power.

255
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
- Tell them the checkpoint opens shortly.
- Yes, My Lady.

256
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,160
Hey! Who is that?!

257
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
- I said stop!
- What is it, Va?

258
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,440
Laor. We must follow him.
He did something at the Office. Come!

259
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
- I shall go that way.
- Hurry!

260
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,760
Stop!

261
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,800
- Stop. Stop!
- Va.

262
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,800
Where did he go?

263
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,720
He was truly fast.

264
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
I tried to cut him off,
but still could not catch him.

265
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
Darn it.

266
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,640
A Dharmachakra lantern?

267
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,240
It looks like the one
you hung over the porch.

268
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,680
Who are these people?

269
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Another record with the Dharmachakra seals

270
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,840
identical to the first one?

271
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,720
It is from a different district.

272
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,640
But why are some entries stamped,

273
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,800
while others are not?

274
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,760
I wonder so.

275
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
What does the Dharmachakra

276
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
truly symbolize?

277
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,560
This is the part I do not know.

278
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,640
Then we shall make it easy.

279
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,160
Let us see for ourselves.

280
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,560
The rumors about my insurrection
are plenty now.

281
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,200
We must be truly careful
with our caravans.

282
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,320
I am very worried about this matter.

283
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,840
Tomorrow, we will have
an important caravan

284
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,040
carrying only weapons.

285
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,880
Perhaps I must go there myself,

286
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,200
to intimidate the customs officers

287
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,720
and make them
let our wagons through faster.

288
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,600
Just as I thought. They are weapons.

289
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,040
Does that mean the Dharmachakra
was stamped on illegal entries?

290
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,320
The customs officers
were afraid to report.

291
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,160
If those caravans belong to the nobles,

292
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,960
the officers who report them
will be in trouble

293
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,040
and may even meet awful ends.

294
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,440
So, the Dharmachakra seal
is used for reporting corrupt officials.

295
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,360
My father trained
all the customs officers of Ayothaya.

296
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,240
He most despised
those who defraud the nation.

297
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,840
The people who gave you these leads

298
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,880
are the honest officers
who are loyal to our land.

299
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,840
But why would they give them to me?

300
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,200
What do they wish for me to do?

301
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
These arms must belong to Luang Bovorntat.

302
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,320
I shall order my men to watch over it.

303
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,520
Once they come to move them,
I shall extract the truth from them.

304
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,800
Horse carriage.

305
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,280
- We must leave.
- Yes.

306
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,240
Khun Pakdee, Luang Bovorntat's loyalist.

307
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,160
Check thoroughly.

308
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,320
- Follow my order. Do you remember it?
- Yes, sir.

309
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,400
It is done, My Lord.

310
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,760
Luang Bovorntat must be inside.

311
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,440
Dear.

312
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,840
What if we capture Luang Bovorntat
with the evidence?

313
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,760
We shall triumph
in thwarting the insurrection.

314
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,880
Ride ahead back to Ayothaya.

315
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
I shall follow the carriage.

316
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,960
But dear, you are without the effigies--

317
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,400
Have you ever seen
Khun Saengplarn unprepared?

318
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,440
Return to the city now. Trust me.

319
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes.

320
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,480
You are not the only one
with a plan, Pansaeng.

321
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
We have ours as well.

322
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,640
<i>Should you face Pansaeng,</i>

323
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,480
use this yantra

324
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
to create a barrier and destroy his magic.

325
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,120
Then, you shall hurt him.

326
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,880
You shall meet your end today.

327
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,280
I shall not be defeated that easily.

328
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
Power of the sun, to me!

329
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
Here I come!

330
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,000
- <i>Buddho Na Ma Pa Ta.</i>
- <i>Namo Buddha Ya.</i>

331
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Loose!

332
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,800
- Curse it!
- Prai. Follow that carriage.

333
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,600
We must capture the man inside!

334
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,160
Go!

335
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,680
Pansaeng.

336
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,160
Halt! Halt!

337
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,920
Protect the Luang!

338
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,440
Is that all you can do? Huh? Is that all?

339
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,560
Prai.

340
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,680
Your magic and strength have returned.

341
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,240
Yes, they have truly returned.

342
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,640
Approach with caution.

343
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
Luang Bovorntat wields powerful magic.

344
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,239
This is not Luang Bovorntat.

345
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,840
Jaokhun Thammanart?

346
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,159
Why is he here?

347
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,280
My Lords, now we have learned the truth,

348
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,159
that the usurper is not me,

349
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
but Jaokhun Thammanart.

350
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
Your apology is due.

351
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,520
The Minister of the Treasury

352
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,240
has the duty to protect
the interests of our nation.

353
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,320
Yet, he had been selling arms
for his own wealth.

354
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,680
No wonder Ayothaya
has almost no wealth left in the Treasury.

355
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
Such a terrible offender

356
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,120
deserves the erasure
of his whole bloodline.

357
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,760
Now, please cease your doubts in me,

358
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,120
for I am the most loyal
to His Majesty the King.

359
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,960
I am not the usurper.

360
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,480
Since the duty
of the Minister of the Treasury is vacant,

361
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,480
what must we do next, My Lord?

362
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,560
Normally, the successor would be his son.

363
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,920
But Thammanart had four wives
and countless sons.

364
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,960
They must be fighting for it.

365
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
That means

366
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,920
the forces of the Treasury
are without its commander.

367
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
Thammanart

368
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,560
gave me his commander's seal.

369
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,160
The soldiers of the Ministry
of the Treasury are now mine.

370
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,440
Your trick for him to inspect the goods

371
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,520
led to his shameful demise.
Since heaven is on our side,

372
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,360
I must now pray
for your long reign, Your Majesty.

373
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,560
You please me greatly!

374
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,200
It shall not be long.

375
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,640
<i>Father found a secret Dharmachakra</i>

376
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,520
<i>to fight against corrupt nobles.</i>

377
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
<i>But how could we customs officers</i>

378
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,680
<i>stand a chance against them?</i>

379
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,160
Who is that?

380
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,840
Stop at once.
Are you one of the Dharmachakras?

381
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,160
Hey!

382
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,440
Do not run away! Come and talk to me.

383
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Stop! Stop!

384
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,640
My Lady. My Lady, where are you going?!

385
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,360
Aon!

386
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
Cunning bladework,

387
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,520
but strength is lacking.

388
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
You need more training.

389
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,040
My Lady.

390
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,440
Aon.

391
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,000
Do not harm My Lady.

392
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,560
This young man appears capable.

393
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,240
You should join our Dharmachakra Order.

394
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,160
Dharmachakra Order?

395
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,720
What is it?

396
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,960
The wheel of Dharma keeps turning.

397
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,000
In the dark days, we shall wait.

398
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,560
When the time comes, we fight villainy.

399
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,200
In the end, Dharma shall prevail.

400
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,080
He is Father's student.

401
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,440
They are customs officers

402
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,120
from everywhere in Ayothaya.

403
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,240
Lady Chavala, you are the leader
we have been waiting for.

404
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,560
You were brave enough to use our leads

405
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,560
to fight for the truth.

406
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,360
Hence, all 15
of the Dharmachakra lanterns were lit.

407
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,760
Chai never lit the Dharmachakra lantern,

408
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,880
so you kept yourselves secret.

409
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,000
Lady Chavala
and Khun Saengplarn are our hope.

410
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,960
They are the right chance, our leaders.

411
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,840
The Dharmachakra Order
has new leaders now.

412
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,800
Let the lanterns

413
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,640
of Dharmachakra shine bright.
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives.

414
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,320
CUSTOMS RECORD

415
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,400
Individual customs records

416
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,760
shall not reveal the goods' routes.

417
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,320
But if we have all from each checkpoint,

418
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,960
we shall see all the paths of goods
everywhere in Ayothaya.

419
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,480
Are you mapping the paths
from all those records?

420
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,360
Yes.

421
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,200
Suspicious goods were stamped
with the Dharmachakra seal.

422
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,800
If these goods often ended up around
the house or storage of certain nobles,

423
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,400
that means

424
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
they are corrupt.

425
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,880
Every customs officer
shall be our witness.

426
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,080
We shall address this evidence
before His Majesty the King,

427
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,080
and let those corrupt nobles be removed.

428
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,680
Their forces shall then
be used to protect our land.

429
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,400
Yes.

430
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,200
I will help you.

431
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,440
Very well.

432
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,640
- Jaokhun Thammanart's goods.
- Hm.

433
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,080
- To Thung Kaeo checkpoint.
- Thung Kaeo.

434
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,000
Dear.

435
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,240
Dear.

436
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,720
Oh?

437
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
It is morning.

438
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,320
I caused you not to sleep last night.

439
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,520
Shall we take a walk?

440
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,440
Good thinking.

441
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,560
Let us go.

442
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,040
How beautiful.

443
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,400
It is truly the city of heaven.

444
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,600
May the love for our land

445
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,920
strengthen my spirit.

446
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,440
I must not die.

447
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,160
I must return home

448
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,920
to see the sun above Ayothaya

449
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,600
with my cozy little soul every day.

450
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,720
Heaven and earth, please bear witness.

451
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,960
I

452
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,400
shall give my life to this nation,

453
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,360
and I shall return home
to see the sun with my husband every day.

454
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,320
Both of your minds
are suffering from lust.

455
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,480
It burns you and distracts you.

456
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,600
Your focus is not pure,

457
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,680
so you cannot perfect
the enlivened effigies.

458
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,120
The effigies are representations.

459
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,600
They require the power
strictly from the owner.

460
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,840
But master sorcerers such as Taen Seenil

461
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,240
can only be defeated with
Pansaeng's enlivened effigies, Master.

462
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,440
If we desire a different outcome,

463
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,200
we must not use the same method.

464
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,120
We shall find a different way to pray.

465
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,800
<i>Out of all the creations,</i>

466
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,000
<i>love is most powerful.</i>

467
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
<i>Trees are merciful.</i>

468
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,880
<i>They are gracious.</i>
<i>They are not possessive nor coercive.</i>

469
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,280
<i>Trees are not vengeful nor hurtful,</i>
<i>for they never expect.</i>

470
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,400
<i>The two of you</i>

471
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,520
<i>must feel the love from the trees</i>
<i>within yourselves.</i>

472
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,240
<i>You must feel it.</i>

473
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,040
THE FULL MOON DAY OF THE FOURTH MONTH
I SHALL BEGIN AN INSURRECTION

474
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,160
Red cloth signs from Prai

475
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,000
- are all over the city.
- What does it say?

476
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Prai shall raid the city

477
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,920
on the full moon day of the fourth month.

478
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,720
The day of Taen Seenil's insurrection.

479
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,360
Our land is in chaos.
What must we do, Saiyud?

480
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,800
We must inform Khun Saengplarn.
He shall help us.

481
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,240
An insurrection begins
on the full moon of the fourth month.

482
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,680
It is only a little over a month.
Are we truly well-prepared?

483
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,120
Master Taen has ordered me so.

484
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,600
He said that Pansaeng is now weakened.
This shall be the best time.

485
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,320
Then, we must gather the forces

486
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,080
more than what Jaokhun Singh has

487
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,520
and seize the royal palace
on the same day.

488
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,800
My ancestors

489
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,160
once ruled this nation.

490
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,880
Now, I shall reclaim it.

491
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,800
The next king shall be called Bovorntat!

492
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,760
I,

493
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,920
Praya Singhanarong,

494
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,040
commander of forces
under Chief of the Armed Forces…

495
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,760
I, Praya Kaewkarop,

496
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,080
commander of forces under
the Ministry of the Royal Household…

497
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,400
I,

498
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,240
Praya Kasetboriban, commander

499
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,880
of forces under
the Ministry of Agriculture…

500
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,800
- hereby swear
- hereby swear

501
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,880
- to protect this land with my life.
- to protect this land with my life.

502
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,240
The pillars of Ayothaya
consist of six noble families.

503
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,200
Why are only three of them present?

504
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,320
Are they betraying
the oath of allegiance water?

505
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,360
Queen Mother,

506
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,440
please be assured

507
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,680
that I intend to gather
three additional forces

508
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,200
to safeguard your throne, Your Highness.

509
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,400
Myself

510
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,040
and Khun Suriyonhassadee believe
that the dynasty of Ayothaya

511
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,400
shall remain unharmed.

512
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,680
What magic is he wielding

513
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,080
to flawlessly imitate me?

514
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,040
Is he truly Taen Seenil?

515
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,440
Yes, Prai.

516
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,360
People are now losing spirit.

517
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,400
I must destroy their camp
before they raid the city.

518
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,840
Destroy the whole camp
full of thieves by ourselves, two men?

519
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,320
Who says there will be two of us?
Only you shall suffice.

520
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,600
Only I?

521
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,240
Master.

522
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,240
I thought you were meditating uphill.

523
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,120
What is your bidding?

524
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,040
I wish to relocate the camp.

525
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,840
All of you, gather your things!

526
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,320
We shall move to the cave

527
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,480
in the tamarind woods.

528
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,320
- Go.
- Move.

529
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,560
Go.

530
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
Hey! What are you doing?

531
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,760
Where are you lot going?!

532
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,080
Master has told us to move.
And he is here.

533
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,520
Who are you?

534
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,200
There are two Masters. What shall we do?

535
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,040
I am the real Prai. You are the imposter!

536
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,080
I am the real one!

537
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,080
Some of you

538
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,480
have been Prai's disciples for decades.

539
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,240
Do you still remember the mantra
for consecrating protection ropes?

540
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,800
Recite it.

541
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,000
Recite it out loud! Recite the mantra.

542
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,280
<i>Buddho Na Ma Pa Ta. Namo Buddha Ya.</i>

543
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,400
I was right.

544
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,560
My master wields yellow protection rope.

545
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,920
That is Taen Seenil in disguise.

546
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,680
He created false protection ropes

547
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,320
to use you all
as an insurrection force to raid Ayothaya.

548
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,040
- What?
- Huh?

549
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,400
Pansaeng!

550
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,840
You are now
at your weakest state, Pansaeng! Die!

551
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,760
<i>May the love for our land</i>

552
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,000
<i>strengthen my spirit.</i>

553
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,960
<i>I must not die. I must return home</i>

554
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,880
<i>to see the sun above Ayothaya</i>

555
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
<i>with my cozy little soul every day.</i>

556
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,160
<i>Use the power of love</i>
<i>to awaken the enlivened effigies.</i>

557
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,200
He has awakened the enlivened effigies.

558
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,000
- Huh?
- The effigies have returned.

559
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,640
Not today.

560
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,800
Not today.

561
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,080
Your magic has returned, brother.

562
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,760
Khun Saengplarn,
the sorcerer, has returned!

563
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,160
My brother has returned.

564
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,600
Who did this to you?!

565
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,920
Pansaeng

566
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,400
has awakened his enlivened effigies.

567
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,880
How did he regain his magic?

568
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,240
Did you not say he cannot take a wife?

569
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,600
Prai's thieves now belong to him.

570
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,320
I cannot lose, my disciple.
I shall have Ayothaya.

571
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,960
I must emerge victorious.

572
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,440
I am the only great sorcerer of this land,

573
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,040
not him!

574
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,640
I am no longer your burden.

575
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,040
I am not the cause of your death.

576
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,400
I am truly no longer your burden.

577
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,040
You are my strength.

578
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,960
My beloved.

579
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,160
My cozy little soul.

580
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,760
The magic of Pansaeng and Prai
are both condemned dark magic.

581
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,280
We must imprison him.

582
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,440
- We cannot!
- We cannot!

583
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,720
If he is imprisoned,
who will protect our land?

584
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,880
<i>I am confined with yantra.</i>

585
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,880
Taen Seenil's yantra.

586
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,840
Why do they not approach?

587
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,120
These are the noble families

588
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,080
and merchants who are corrupt, My Lord.

589
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,520
No wonder.

590
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,720
Your name is on the map as well.

591
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,600
Go to Pansaeng's house and bring it to me.

592
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,800
What are you doing…?

593
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,240
Here they come.

594
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,840
Ayothaya, my motherland.

595
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,680
Let the lanterns
of Dharmachakra shine bright!

596
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,160
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives!

597
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,320
Let us start the new dynasty of Ayothaya.

598
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,400
We three families shall reign together.

599
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,400
