1
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,600
The royal archive is ablaze?

2
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
The original Dharmachakra records.

3
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,440
<i>I cannot lose the key evidence.</i>

4
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
Va!

5
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,240
-My Lady!
-Va!

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,400
-Please, sir!
-Let go of me!

7
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,240
Are you injured somewhere?

8
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
I do not know you.

9
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,640
We were so deeply in love.

10
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,680
If you put too much pressure on her,

11
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,960
it will only lead her
to the path of insanity,

12
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
unable to regain her memory forever.

13
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
It is time for the rebels
to raid the city, is it not?

14
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,160
The moment we most dreaded.

15
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,600
Pansaeng is dying in this war.

16
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Charge!

17
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
-Go!
-Go!

18
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,360
Go!

19
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,600
Seal the city gates.

20
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,680
Where are all the palace guards?

21
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,880
They have cleared the way
for me to fight you.

22
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,560
Bovorntat.

23
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,560
By the power of <i>the Rattana Tri,</i>

24
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,080
<i>Phra Siam Devadhiraj</i>
shall protect all of you!

25
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,000
Do not fear these devils!

26
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Fight them! Jaokhun Singh's company!

27
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
Fight on!

28
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,440
You may have bested me,

29
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
but you shall not stand a chance
against Master Taen.

30
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,400
If Khun Saengplarn is outmatched,
who would help him?

31
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,520
Now.

32
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Let us go!

33
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,440
-Go!
-Go!

34
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Ming, I cannot move!

35
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
I cannot move as well.

36
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,440
We have walked into a trap.
The magic confinement from Taen Seenil.

37
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,920
At last, you are holding still

38
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,320
for me to cut you down, one by one.

39
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,680
Who shall I kill first?

40
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,720
You must be Pansaeng's favorite disciple.

41
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,440
I shall kill you first then.

42
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,920
Do you think you will
strike fear by killing me?

43
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,160
We are soldiers, for we do not fear death.

44
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,320
In every land, there are those like us

45
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
who fall defending their homeland

46
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,920
and protecting others.
This is a noble death.

47
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
Unlike you, who shall soon die

48
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,160
for a terrible master
such as Luang Bovorntat.

49
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,000
-Watch your mouth!
-Ming.

50
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,520
Shall I strike you down now?!

51
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
I, Jaokhun Amorn,

52
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,840
have come to protect Ayothaya!

53
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,840
The trap has vanished.
When did I master the spell?

54
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,080
Ming. Free me from the trap as well!

55
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,680
I have not learned to free others yet.

56
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,680
Ming.

57
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,760
Cast some spells and it will work! Hurry!

58
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Fine.

59
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,680
When have I grown stronger
than Taen Seenil?

60
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,000
Easy, boy.

61
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,720
It was my doing.

62
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,480
Oh, Prai.

63
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you, Prai.

64
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,920
Harn. I have never raided your village.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
My life as a thief ended decades ago.

66
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,800
All that happened was Taen Seenil's doing.

67
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,200
Go!

68
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,080
I shall go help Pansaeng inside.

69
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,040
Let me go with you.

70
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,840
Go on!

71
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
All of you must place your fingerprints

72
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,280
to grant King Bovorntat the authority

73
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,040
to rule this land!
Your refusal guarantees your demise.

74
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,200
Go.

75
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,560
I shall leave this for Lady Chavala, sir.

76
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,160
Dharmachakra Order returns.

77
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
It is Lady Va's doing.

78
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,160
Go!

79
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,160
Aon. Saiyud. Go!

80
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
Taen Seenil.

81
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,480
No one has physically seen Taen Seenil

82
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
because he has been masquerading

83
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,840
as Chao Phraya Kaewkarop, the Minister
of the Royal Household, for decades!

84
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,160
Yes.

85
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
Decades ago,

86
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,920
I was sick of residing
in the middle of nowhere.

87
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,640
I realized,

88
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
instead of being a thief
hiding from the soldiers,

89
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,360
why did I not transform into one?!

90
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,120
And if I were to be a soldier,

91
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,560
I must be that of Chao Phraya!

92
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,080
What have you done to my teacher?

93
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,160
What have you done?!

94
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,200
He only faced a lonely death.

95
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,520
He took his last breath
in an underground chamber,

96
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,040
with his wife and daughter moving about
in the home directly overhead!

97
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
I most favor my new life.

98
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,800
I am younger and wealthier!

99
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,480
I have a wife and a daughter!
I live a noble life

100
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
respected by people!

101
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,760
This is a life
I have always dreamed of having!

102
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I was wrong not to notice.

103
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,520
May the angels…

104
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
What is it?

105
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,400
May the angels bring forth

106
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,840
their death in three days.

107
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,520
Do not let them prosper in three months.

108
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,160
Do not allow them
to advance for three years.

109
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,400
The curse from the oath of allegiance
against any insurrections.

110
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,080
<i>The real Jaokhun Kaew</i>

111
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,560
would never forget that lesson!

112
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,520
The cane that was in the prison
was also a forgery!

113
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,080
The royal archive
was ablaze because of you.

114
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,840
And there are no royal guards
to protect the king!

115
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,040
And did you transform into Prai

116
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,080
to satisfy your lust for killing?

117
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,400
<i>When Prai was captured,</i>
<i>I saw him in prison.</i>

118
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,920
My Asoraveda allows me
to transform into anyone!

119
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,240
No other sorcerers

120
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,960
are able to take as many forms as I do!

121
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,760
Know that you are merely

122
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,800
a would-be sorcerer!

123
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
You are such a vile monster!

124
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,800
You find joy in slaughtering.

125
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,120
You have seen it with your own eyes!

126
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,760
-No!
-Mother!

127
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,760
No!

128
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,880
Saenkam and I

129
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,320
had a chance to taste your sister as well!

130
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,640
I shall kill you today!

131
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
I shall drag you to the deepest hell!

132
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
You stand no chance against me.

133
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,840
I have allowed you to live till this day

134
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,800
only to toy with you.

135
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,960
But now I am bored. It is time

136
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,720
for me to ascend to the throne!

137
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,280
You shall die!

138
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,960
<i>It is time for me to give up my life</i>

139
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,920
<i>to Master Yai</i>

140
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,920
<i>as I have vowed to, Va.</i>

141
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,800
<i>I do not have even a hint of regret</i>

142
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,840
<i>for choosing love</i>

143
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,360
<i>and not power.</i>

144
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,480
<i>What Master Yai was unaware of</i>

145
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,760
<i>is that my spirit remains unbroken</i>

146
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,560
<i>and free from pain.</i>

147
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,120
<i>On the contrary, the spirits</i>
<i>of those who find true love</i>

148
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,080
<i>are gentle and light.</i>

149
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,920
<i>We are destined</i>
<i>to fly ahead to the next realm,</i>

150
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,120
<i>there to wait</i>
<i>for our loved ones to join us.</i>

151
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
<i>Farewell, my cozy little soul.</i>

152
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
Va! Va!

153
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
What happened to you, Va?!

154
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,200
Va! Va! Va!

155
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,480
Va! Va! Va!

156
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
Va! Va!

157
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
Today, I am Taen Seenil,

158
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
the great sorcerer
and the ruler of this land!

159
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,400
Pansaeng.

160
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,720
Pansaeng.

161
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,319
Pansaeng.

162
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,880
Beyond destroying my name,

163
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
you have taken my brother's life!

164
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,560
Now you must choose.

165
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,120
Die or serve under me. Choose!

166
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
Once you die,

167
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,280
I shall make you my vengeful spirit.

168
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,920
I shall bond my spirit with yours

169
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,440
and give them to every guardian angel.

170
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,000
This way, both of our spirits shall be
even more powerful than Taen Seenil.

171
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,640
I am to protect Ayothaya?

172
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,480
Yes.

173
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,640
We shall bond our spirits from tonight on.

174
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,520
We shall do it every night,

175
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,520
until your death arrives.

176
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,560
<i>Om</i>, I hereby summon
the vengeful spirits to protect my land.

177
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,080
<i>Om</i>, I shall awake
every restless spirit you have killed.

178
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,520
From every curse against you,

179
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,640
may karma grant it.

180
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,800
May the evil be defeated.

181
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,640
From every curse against you,

182
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,360
may karma grant it.

183
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
May the evil be defeated.

184
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,120
Guardian angels.
Please assist Khun Saengplarn.

185
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
Who are you two?

186
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,800
Victory is ours. Victory is ours!

187
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
Victory is ours!

188
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,040
Victory is ours!

189
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,240
Victory is ours!

190
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
Pansaeng.

191
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,040
He is not breathing.

192
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,960
Master.

193
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,000
Pansaeng.

194
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,440
Pansaeng.

195
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
Pansaeng.

196
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,800
He has come to, Master.

197
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Open his mouth.

198
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,600
Open up.

199
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
Pansaeng.

200
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,600
He is fine.

201
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
We are blessed
by Your Majesty's benevolence

202
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,240
to be able to be present here

203
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,360
before you, Your Majesty.

204
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,400
You have our thanks.

205
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,120
Soldiers who have risked their lives
to protect Ayothaya shall be promoted

206
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,600
and be rewarded with gold from the king.

207
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,080
Master Nandha, I have sent men
to renovate your master's monastery.

208
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,320
You need not wander anymore.

209
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,520
Let Ayothaya be your forever home.

210
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,800
Your Majesty,
I humbly request your approval

211
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,880
to establish the Royal Physicians' Bureau
for the purpose of curing the sick.

212
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,520
Would it be possible?

213
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,000
Sathu. Ayothaya
is blessed by your presence.

214
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,320
Tell us should you need anything.

215
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,440
I am deeply thankful.

216
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,080
Furthermore, I seek your approval

217
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,400
to present a new soldier, Your Majesty.

218
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,160
Khun Paireepichit.

219
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
Master. I am most delighted.

220
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
I have been given
a new house as well, Master.

221
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,600
What of my men?

222
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,080
Every one of them

223
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,720
is now registered
as a soldier in my command.

224
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,960
Thank you, Jaokhun Singh.

225
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,880
Uh… My deepest gratitude.

226
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
My profound respect.

227
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,080
I bow before you, Your Majesty.

228
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,200
I bow. I bow.

229
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,800
Your Majesty, there is one more soldier

230
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
for whom I seek

231
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,360
your approval
to grant special commendations.

232
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
Please allow me to present

233
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,000
Luang Suriyonhassadee, Your Majesty.

234
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,040
Are you fully recovered?

235
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
I am well now, Your Majesty.

236
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,360
Jaokhun Singh is taking
good care of me, Your Majesty.

237
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,400
He is now happily residing
in my home, Your Majesty.

238
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,400
I am always being told that I am strange.

239
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,600
I do think that he is even more strange.

240
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,520
Witness this.

241
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,800
My Lord, what is your name?

242
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,560
I am not certain.

243
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,080
There he goes.

244
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,400
What kind of man
does not know for certain who he is?

245
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
Some call me Khun Saengplarn,
while others call me

246
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,320
Pansaeng. But

247
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,280
I am fine with all those names.

248
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,120
What of your parents?
Where did they come from?

249
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,160
Jaokhun Singh is my father.
And his wife is my mother.

250
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,680
As for the house…

251
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,440
I am not certain what that area is called,

252
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,240
but boatmen were precise when I told them
to go to Jaokhun Singh's house.

253
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,720
Khun Saengplarn.

254
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,360
Forgive me. You are a Luang now, My Lord.

255
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,040
Do we know each other?

256
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
Yes, My Lord.

257
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,520
Are you leaving now?

258
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,880
Are you not staying to see the sun?

259
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,320
I have been here for a while,

260
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
even before dawn.

261
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Who is it that is playing

262
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,400
such a beautiful song?

263
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,840
Yes.

264
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,200
Here.

265
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,120
You may wish to try it.

266
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,199
Father.

267
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Why am I feeling

268
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,120
as if I am spending my life
waiting for someone

269
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,920
without even knowing who that person is?

270
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,040
This

271
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,560
is the true meaning

272
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,840
of love destiny.

273
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Laor! This is bad, Laor.

274
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,200
Ming is fighting with his old enemy,
Daeng from Wat Krai.

275
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,640
What? Have they not
settled their differences?

276
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,160
Let us go look.

277
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,560
Laor! Laor! Laor! Come with me!

278
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,280
Thong is in a fight. They are having
a brutal brawl at Pa Khlong market.

279
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,560
What? Why are these things
happening at the same time?

280
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,440
Come with me. Ming is hot-headed
and does not listen to anyone.

281
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,200
He would only listen to you. Come.

282
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,680
But Thong is afraid of you, Laor.

283
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,080
Only you can stop him.

284
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,200
What must I do?

285
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,160
Hear this, Yong. Tell Thong not to be
so bold after only being promoted.

286
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,720
If he is demoted, I will not see him.

287
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,480
-Let us go to Ming.
-Come.

288
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,600
Do you choose Ming, Laor?

289
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,280
I win. Give me your money.

290
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
What truly is this?

291
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,440
Are none of you in a fight?

292
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,840
Have you two been lying to me?

293
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yong and I have argued while drinking

294
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,000
about who you would pick,
so we came here to test you.

295
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,080
This foolish game is improper.

296
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,640
And why must you bring those two?

297
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,080
Thong!

298
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,440
Give me.

299
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,920
Give me your money.

300
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,480
What is so amusing? Stop smiling.

301
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,720
I will not.

302
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,280
Does anyone around here play the fiddle?

303
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,200
There is only one around here, My Lady.

304
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
Only one?

305
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,360
They can play this song as well?

306
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,720
My Lady.

307
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,600
Where are you going, My Lady?

308
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,160
My Lady.

309
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,080
My Lady.

310
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,000
Aon, follow her.

311
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,200
Yes.

312
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,840
My lady. Hey.

313
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,640
My Lady!

314
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,160
My lady.

315
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,040
She is My Lady, My Lord.

316
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,680
She is unwell,
but secretly snuck off to go boating.

317
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,960
Hm.

318
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,600
It is fortunate that she is fine.

319
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,000
Please excuse me, My Lord.

320
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
Wait.

321
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,440
Yes, My Lord?

322
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,920
Where did this cloth come from?

323
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,080
A lady gave it to you, My Lord.

324
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,400
A lady?

325
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,680
What lady?

326
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,320
My lady?

327
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,280
Greetings, My Lord.

328
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,560
My name is Pimpilai.

329
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,280
Was it you who gave me this cloth?

330
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,080
Yes.

331
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,680
Do you like it, My Lord?

332
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,960
Very much.

333
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,200
We were acquainted.

334
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,640
We have been in love before.

335
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,760
Is that true?

336
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,960
You favor the perfume
from bullet wood that I made for you.

337
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Do you remember now?

338
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,440
Uh… This is not it.

339
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,680
What is not it?

340
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
It is love destiny.

341
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,200
If we have not met the one,

342
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,520
we would feel incomplete.

343
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,560
But once we meet them,

344
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,520
we will feel complete here.

345
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,600
Please forgive me,

346
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,640
but I do not feel anything for you.

347
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,280
All this time, is it you?

348
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,120
Heaven and earth, please bear witness.

349
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,960
I shall give my life to this nation,

350
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,160
and I shall return home
to see the sun with my husband every day.

351
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,160
<i>Let us take some time</i>
<i>to enjoy these flowers together.</i>

352
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,960
I appreciate them for only a few minutes.

353
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,240
I do not wish to own them.

354
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,120
I shall hold you in my heart.

355
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,760
I

356
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,400
love you,

357
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,600
not as a sibling.

358
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,720
And it is not merely an admiration.

359
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,680
<i>May the love for our land</i>

360
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,320
strengthen my spirit.

361
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,520
I must not die. I must return home

362
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,200
to see the sun above Ayothaya

363
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,960
with my cozy little soul every day.

364
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
<i>If death does us part,</i>

365
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,160
in every lifetime,

366
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,760
please remember in your heart and soul

367
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,720
the truth…

368
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,680
that I love you…

369
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,280
and I shall be ever by your side.

370
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,600
What is yours?

371
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,440
I wished to be reborn
to meet you in every life

372
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,560
and for us to always remember each other.

373
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,400
What is it that you wished for?

374
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,600
I shall tell you next time.

375
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,600
Last Songkran,

376
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,680
what did you wish for?

377
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,800
I wished

378
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,600
that no matter how many times

379
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,560
or anywhere I am reborn,

380
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,560
heaven or hell,

381
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,120
may the sacred beings allow me

382
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,120
to be born and live alongside you

383
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,120
forevermore.

384
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,000
My cozy little soul.

385
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,120
At last,

386
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,840
the suffering is behind you.

387
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,320
From now on,

388
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,840
may your family life begin prosperously.

389
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,080
<i>This house was merely a wood structure</i>
<i>before you came along.</i>

390
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,560
<i>But thanks to you,</i>
<i>a wood structure became a home.</i>

391
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,640
Our land is now at peace.

392
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,200
There are no thieves for you to hunt.

393
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,400
What is the duty

394
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,400
you wish to fulfill, dear?

395
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,160
I believe in the law.

396
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,360
The formidable law

397
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,800
shall prevent the wicked
from grasping the power of this land.

398
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,160
I will draft legislation.

399
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,800
I shall not stop until we no longer
need the soldiers to hunt down thieves.

400
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,280
That is good.

401
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,200
I shall no longer feel cold at nights,

402
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,000
since I have your warm embrace.

403
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,680
You are no longer in pain.

404
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,360
My nightmare has come to an end.

405
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,080
The kiss I have been waiting for.

406
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,000
Tonight

407
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,800
is the night I gave my life for.

408
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,480
I lost my parents…

409
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
and lived my life chasing vengeance.

410
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Whenever the wind blew,
I never felt refreshed.

411
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,160
Whenever the flowers blossomed,
I never smelled their scents.

412
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,400
Until I met you.

413
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,280
My cozy little soul.

414
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,640
For me, you are my inspiration.

415
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,680
You have awakened the courage in me

416
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,800
and those people around you.

417
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,120
Courage

418
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,880
is born from love.

419
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,080
Loving anyone

420
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,960
or anything

421
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,720
will allow you to fight for them.

422
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,040
This is a power greater than any magic.

423
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,480
Even when life is painful

424
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,560
and destiny seems cruel,
we have to endure.

425
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,240
But it is all worth it.

426
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,120
Because life devoid of love

427
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,280
is a life of nullity.

428
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,400
THE END

429
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,880
