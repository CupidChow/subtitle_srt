1
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,560
Die!

2
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,520
You!

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
-Come here!
-No! Please spare us!

4
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Come.

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,000
Let go! Let go!

6
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,680
Mother!

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,400
Come here!

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,880
Stop! Hey!

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,480
You, search that house!

10
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
Take everything you can!

11
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,040
I wish to learn all the magic

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,960
to kill Taen Seenil for pillaging my home.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,560
You seek the path
of a sorcerer, don't you?

14
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,520
I dreamed of becoming a civil servant.

15
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,880
I'll rid our nation of all the villainy!

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
To become my student,

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,800
you shall take no wife.

18
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,120
Can you do it?

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,840
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,639
Your vow of celibacy

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,800
has been given to me. Hold to it.

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,160
If not, the magic will harm you.

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
You'll become weak,

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,080
defeated,

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,880
and eventually die.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,200
I give you my word.

27
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
<i>The king is still young.</i>

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,160
<i>And the royal court</i>
<i>is full of corrupt noblemen.</i>

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
<i>People are struggling to make a living.</i>

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,520
Robbery and theft plague every corner.

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,880
The safety of the citizens
is what I aspire to protect.

32
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,280
What?! Why won't he die?!

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Pansaeng went to subdue the thieves again?

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,200
He'll surely be rewarded when he returns.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,480
It's all because of him

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,200
that I'm stuck being just a Muen.

37
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
This Khun Saengplarn

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,360
practices dark magic. Is that true?

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Pfft! To hell with dark magic.

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
He's nothing but a peasant.
He's come this far only by sheer luck.

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
<i>Lately,</i>

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,480
<i>many lists of the goods</i>
<i>for public use are lost.</i>

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,600
<i>I want you to inspect</i>
<i>all the merchant caravans,</i>

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,600
<i>especially those departing from Ayothaya.</i>

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,560
Those wicked civil servants.

46
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,160
They only serve themselves
and their friends.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
As long as I'm here, don't ever think
you can get away with all of this.

48
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh, good morning.

49
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,080
Yes.

50
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's go, Va.

51
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
-Aunty Khiew!
-Yes?

52
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
I brought some brass bowls today.

53
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
They're nice and shiny. Do you want one?

54
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, I'll have one.

55
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
Right.

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Let's move here.

57
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,000
Hey, Khun Saengplarn is coming this way!
Quickly, gather round!

58
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,440
What? Khun Saengplarn!

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's look at the handsome Khun!

60
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,040
Whoa!

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
-The horses are coming through!
-Out of the way!

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,200
Va! Let go of that old cow!
You need to move!

63
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,840
Hey, move to the side now. Hurry. Move.

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
Va, forget about it!

65
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,200
Go, you old cow! You'll be trampled! Go!

66
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
-Go!
-Va!

67
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,000
My Lady, are you hurt?

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,320
Khun Saengplarn! Sir!

69
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
My apologies, sir.

70
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,640
Please accept our apologies.

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,400
We're rushing to catch the thieves
and not being careful.

72
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Let's go.

73
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
Come on.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,880
Thinking about it
just made it more frustrating!

75
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,480
What are you lot looking at?

76
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
Do I look pathetic?

77
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,320
-Ngiam!
-Yes, sir.

78
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
Have them flogged!

79
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,200
As you command, sir.

80
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
Chai!

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
Stop torturing the servants.
They didn't even offend you.

82
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,720
You wicked sister. How strange
of you to treat them like siblings.

83
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,840
Father taught us to be merciful.
They're humans just like us.

84
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,400
Did you forget everything Father told us?

85
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
It's you who forgot.

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,760
The daughter of a proper Praya,
desperate to be a merchant.

87
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
You wander off, selling goods
in the markets,

88
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,400
bringing shame to our parents.

89
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,800
Isn't that money you're wasting every day
coming from me selling goods?

90
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,560
You use this house as a gambling den.

91
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,840
You do nothing but drink
and play around with women all day.

92
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,880
And you blamed some other Khun
instead of looking at yourself, brother.

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
You think that
Khun Saengplarn is better than me?!

94
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,400
You take his side,

95
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,240
praise him like everyone in Ayothaya does!

96
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,760
Chai, I don't even know him.
I only met him once.

97
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
So, you've met him?!

98
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,880
Breathtaking, wasn't he? So impressed
that you had to insult your brother?

99
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
You're just…

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
-My Lady!
-Va!

101
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
My Lady.

102
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,280
-I'm alright.
-You wicked sister!

103
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,200
My Lady.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Aon! Aon!

105
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,240
-Aon!
-Please stop this, sir! There are

106
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,960
only the two of you,
brother and sister, left.

107
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Laor! You were but a child yesterday.

108
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,600
Now you dare to stop me?

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Good.

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
You're sleeping with me tonight!

111
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
-Come here!
-Va!

112
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,039
No.

113
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,840
Chai! Chai! I beg you!

114
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,840
Please don't do this with Laor.
She's still so young, Chai.

115
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
-Please.
-Hrrng!

116
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
My Lady!

117
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
My Lady!

118
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,039
She's your favorite.

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,080
So, I'll make her my woman.

120
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Chai.

121
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,280
So you'll have some respect for me.

122
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Please don't do this, sir. I beg you.

123
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,680
Sooner or later, you'll be serving me.

124
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,920
Come here!

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,280
Please let go of me!

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,520
Please!

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
Laor!

128
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,400
Allow me
to serve you tonight instead, sir.

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,920
Saiyud.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,480
Stay out of this.

131
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,440
Please listen.

132
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
I'd like to serve you with something

133
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
special, sir.

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,280
Take tonight as a warning.

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Saiyud…

136
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,040
I can't stay here anymore. Chai is turning
into a devil more and more each day.

137
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,720
My Lady.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,320
Why are you packing up?

139
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm taking Laor away
to Uncle's house in Phitsanulok.

140
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,080
Laor. Pack only what you need.

141
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,600
We'll sneak out of this house
tomorrow before dawn.

142
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,960
Will you return to save us, My Lady?

143
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Noi. I'll report everything to Uncle

144
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,520
and get him to come help
all the servants in this house.

145
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,520
If not, you all would not survive,

146
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,640
either through discipline or by starving.

147
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,880
Please take me with you.

148
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,720
Saiyud and all your brothers
and sisters need you, Aon.

149
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Chai is very drunk tonight.

150
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,960
By tomorrow,
Saiyud will be covered in bruises.

151
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,560
Please take good care of her, Aon.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,440
How would you travel there, My Lady?

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,440
There'll be only you two women.

154
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Khiew's merchant caravan

155
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
will be heading to Phitsanulok tomorrow.

156
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,800
Loar and I will hitch a ride
on one of the wagons.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,880
My girl.

158
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,520
A few merchant wagons
are heading north, sir.

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,680
Ming, go check that caravan with me.

160
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,600
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll leave them to you, Harn, Yong.

162
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,080
-Yes, Khun Saengplarn.
-Yes, sir.

163
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,480
-Time to go!
-Hurry.

164
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,960
How long do we have to hide in here, Va?

165
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,920
We'll be there by tomorrow morning.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,440
And will they get mad if they
find out we sneaked in here?

167
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
I really don't know.

168
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,760
Halt!

169
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm Khun Saengplarn.

170
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,080
Where did you all come from?

171
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,280
Ayothaya market, sir.

172
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
What are the goods?

173
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,520
Normal cartons of goods, sir.

174
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
I wish to inspect them.

175
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,360
Open it all for me to see.

176
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,760
-I'm in a hurry, sir.
-I told you to open it up!

177
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,000
Or do you want me to do it myself?

178
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,480
-Ming.
-Yes, sir.

179
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,640
Go take a look.

180
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,280
Khun Saengplarn!
There's sulfur and saltpeter!

181
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
Sulfur and saltpeter.

182
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,200
Together, they make gunpowder.

183
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,640
What should we do, Va?

184
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,720
These are all illegal items.
How could we hitch on the wrong wagon?

185
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,120
These prohibited goods

186
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,040
can't be sold by anyone
except the royal officials!

187
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,720
I'll seize them
and send you all to the magistrate.

188
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,640
We should run into the woods, My Lady.

189
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,160
There are women in here, sir!

190
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,000
Everyone, run!

191
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,080
-Hey!
-Stop!

192
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,240
Catch them. We need witnesses.

193
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,760
They've got reinforcements!

194
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,520
Let's go!

195
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
Come on!

196
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,440
-Careful, Laor.
-Yes.

197
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,800
Va!

198
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,120
This way.

199
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,840
Does it hurt, My Lady?

200
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
Be careful, My Lady.

201
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
Where did this caravan take off from?

202
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,160
We don't know, sir.

203
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Are you one of them?

204
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,840
No, sir. We only snuck in for a ride.

205
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,240
I only knew that this caravan
was heading to Phitsanulok.

206
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,080
My uncle lives there,
so my sister and I snuck in to go see him.

207
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Then, you'll have to prove it.
Turn yourselves in.

208
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Yes, sir. We will turn ourselves in.
Let's go, Laor.

209
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
What?

210
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey.

211
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,840
What?!

212
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,760
Who told you to get on my horse?

213
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,480
But I'm turning myself in.

214
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,720
Ming.

215
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,400
-Take her in as a witness.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,920
I'll follow them.

217
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,760
Also, bring this evidence to Ayothaya.

218
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
Be careful, sir.

219
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
Go.

220
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,000
Get rid of him!

221
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,880
What's happening, sir?!

222
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Halt!

223
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,520
They say you're invulnerable.

224
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,840
Seems to be just a baseless rumor!

225
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,520
Look!

226
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,360
What?!

227
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
Am I still alive?!

228
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,560
Here.

229
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,360
Why are you crying?

230
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
My sister and I got on the wrong wagon.

231
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,440
Now we need to find a new way to run.

232
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
You want to run?

233
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,520
Possessing saltpeter

234
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,080
and sulfur is a serious crime.

235
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,680
You will testify before
the Chief of the Armed Forces.

236
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,440
You can't run anywhere.

237
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,720
You can just put me in jail.

238
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,640
Stop right there.

239
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,400
I won't be tricked by your foolish plan.

240
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
Tell me what your plan really is.

241
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,040
What plan, sir?

242
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,320
I heard that

243
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
they would send women to tease you

244
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,160
in order to destroy your magic.

245
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,920
They actually sent a few of them, My Lord.

246
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,560
Did I warn you too late?

247
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,720
The first one
came straight to the camp, My Lord.

248
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,640
She's the top concubine of Ayothaya.

249
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Her chest is like this,
and her waist is like this.

250
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,440
The second one pretended
to come work as a servant.

251
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,880
She's a young maiden. She has a face

252
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
so sweet it cuts to the heart, My Lord.

253
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,400
And the third one is actually a masseuse.

254
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,000
She ran her hands
all over Khun Saengplarn for hours,

255
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
and he didn't even flinch.

256
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
I thought his skin

257
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,560
has deteriorated and lost all feeling.

258
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,000
For heaven's sake!

259
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,640
-Oh, really?
-Whoa!

260
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,280
-Shut up, you all.
-What?

261
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
What a waste.

262
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,880
So, there were three of them in total?

263
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,040
Sending another dozen
wouldn't make any difference, My Lord.

264
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,520
So, whose wagons are they?

265
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
Why won't you answer my question?!

266
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,920
How could I? I don't know anything, sir.

267
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,080
You can just kill me.

268
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,360
After all,

269
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
my life doesn't matter to anyone anymore.

270
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,800
Then, die!

271
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Father,

272
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,040
Mother,

273
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Chai has grown so cruel.

274
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,160
I wouldn't be able to stop
his cruelty anymore.

275
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
I'll now join you, Father

276
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,680
and Mother.

277
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,920
Come here.

278
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
Sir, what are you doing?

279
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,120
-Hey.
-Ow. Khun Saengplarn.

280
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
Sir. Sir, I beg you.

281
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,560
You can just kill me,

282
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
but please don't do anything to me.

283
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,280
Please, sir.

284
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,120
These are herbs.

285
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,320
<i>Buddha protects.</i>

286
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,960
<i>Dharma cures.</i>

287
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,640
<i>Please ease her pain.</i>

288
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
<i>Please mend her wound.</i>

289
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
Done.

290
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
Thank you, sir.

291
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
Get some sleep.

292
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,320
I told you, Muen Vorachai, sir,

293
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
that my wagon was broken. Lady Chavala
wasn't in it. I didn't know anything!

294
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,320
There was a caravan leaving yesterday,

295
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,600
but I don't know whose
and what was in there.

296
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Do you dare test me, Khiew?

297
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,400
Ow.

298
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Muen Vorachai, please don't hurt me, sir.

299
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,880
-Where is she?
-I really don't know.

300
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,480
They must be talking about
our caravan, Luang Bovorntat.

301
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,520
Hey, hey!

302
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
What is going on here?

303
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,960
Luang Bovorntat.

304
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
My Lord, please help me.

305
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,440
Muen Vorachai is accusing me

306
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,960
of getting his sister away from him.

307
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,760
I really didn't do it!

308
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,080
Your sister ran away, Muen Vorachai?

309
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,040
If my sister is with
Khun Saengplarn right now,

310
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,640
he would take her back to Ayothaya.

311
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,520
I will take this matter
to the fullest extent.

312
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
Wait a moment.

313
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,120
Among the noblemen,
some dislike Khun Saengplarn

314
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,000
for his arrogance
and lack of respect for anyone.

315
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
What are your thoughts on this matter?

316
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,000
I hate him more than anything, My Lord.

317
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,400
He's just a peasant who became a Khun

318
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,760
by groveling
at Jaokhun Singh's feet. But for me,

319
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm the son of a Praya.
I inherited my father's service

320
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,440
but haven't been promoted
in years because of him.

321
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,080
Good. Then, we're on the same side.

322
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,920
I have a plan

323
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,120
to teach Khun Saengplarn a lesson.

324
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,840
Your sister can help us with this.

325
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,800
My sister?

326
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,200
Khun Saengplarn.

327
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
For the interrogation
that you're taking me to,

328
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
will it take a long time, sir?

329
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,120
Once it's done,
will it be fine with the magistrate

330
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
if I take a boat to Phitsanulok?

331
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,000
Hey, I've never seen

332
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,440
a lady from a noble family
who's as bold as you.

333
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Khun Saengplarn.

334
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,160
What is it?

335
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,840
It was reported

336
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,400
that you've kidnapped Lady Chavala.

337
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
Kidnapped?

338
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,160
Muen Vorachai, the chief customs officer

339
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
and Lady Chavala's brother,
was the one who reported this, sir.

340
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,040
I thought you said this wasn't a trap.

341
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,440
Seductress.

342
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,280
A seductress like you
can't do anything to me.

343
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,440
Sir.

344
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,800
I lost the caravan.

345
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,480
What about you?

346
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,400
Did you get anything from those goods?

347
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,600
Nothing, sir.

348
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,400
I saved that Laor girl from danger
and then regrouped with Harn.

349
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,920
When I returned,
the wagons and goods were all gone.

350
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,240
We've lost all the evidence and witnesses.

351
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,240
We can't hold them responsible at all!

352
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,440
And now, there's news of you
kidnapping Muen Vorachai's sister.

353
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,160
Everyone in the city is talking about it.
How could that happen, sir?

354
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
Sir.

355
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,920
Jaokhun Singh is waiting for you inside.

356
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,560
Before this, the lost items
were usually valuable goods.

357
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,360
I thought any corrupt noblemen
could be behind it.

358
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,160
But this time, it was saltpeter

359
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
and also sulfur that could
be used to make gunpowder.

360
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,160
Is it possible

361
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,760
that Ayothaya
is going to be engulfed in flames?

362
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,200
What are you trying to say, My Lord?

363
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm suspecting

364
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,520
that an insurrection is imminent.

365
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,080
The king is still young. During this time,

366
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,040
noblemen hold more power
than the royal family.

367
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
All the noble clans

368
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,400
have accumulated vast amounts of wealth

369
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
and their own militias.

370
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,560
Those who've ambushed us

371
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,040
were well-armed and highly skilled.

372
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,600
They were not some bandits.

373
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,160
Some noblemen
must be behind this, My Lord.

374
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,480
Greetings,

375
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,640
Master Taen.

376
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,120
They've caught on.

377
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,920
They followed our caravan.

378
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,320
But we were fortunate

379
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,160
that I was there to watch over it myself.

380
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,440
This Khun Saengplarn.

381
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,960
If he persists,

382
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,480
our mission will be extremely difficult.

383
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,080
I have a good plan, Master.

384
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,880
Please wait and see.

385
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,880
A young, strapped man like him

386
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
wouldn't survive this.

387
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,760
-Va.
-Laor.

388
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,040
Laor.

389
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,360
You're not hurt, aren't you?

390
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,080
I'm fine. Ming was so skillful.

391
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,880
He brought me home
since yesterday afternoon.

392
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,200
Are you still in pain, Va?

393
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,000
Did Chai punish you, Laor?

394
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Ah, here you go.

395
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,120
My Lady.

396
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,560
Muen Vorachai is treating us
to the whole pig, My Lady.

397
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,320
He lets us have a break
for an entire day too, My Lady.

398
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,120
Wait.

399
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Chai did this?

400
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,440
Yes.

401
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,280
Are you finally home,

402
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,320
my beloved sister?

403
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,720
How was it?

404
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,640
Has your desire been satisfied?

405
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,160
You can't report Khun Saengplarn.

406
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
He didn't kidnap me.

407
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,400
He was just inspecting an illegal caravan
and found me inside. That's all.

408
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,040
What illegal caravan?

409
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,880
No one knows about it.

410
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,400
The entire market said that you and him

411
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,120
like each other.

412
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,480
It was only an accident.

413
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,840
Chai, please withdraw
your accusation against him.

414
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,320
You're defending him so much.

415
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,520
I see now why you two
were so into each other

416
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,320
and had to make love in the woods.

417
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,320
Keep your filthy words to yourself.
I'm your sister.

418
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
They will investigate this tomorrow.

419
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,360
Just sit there and don't say anything.

420
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
I will take care of everything.

421
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,680
What are you taking care of?

422
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,560
Just do everything exactly as I said.

423
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Otherwise, these well-fed servants

424
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,040
will be dealt with.

425
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
What are you planning to do?

426
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,520
It could be a trap

427
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
using a lady to distract you.

428
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,760
I thought so, My Lord.

429
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,920
Spending the night
alone together like that

430
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,200
would inevitably lead to slander.

431
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
What should we do, My Lord?

432
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,360
Muen Vorachai
must be fabricating this story

433
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,520
together with other corrupt noblemen.

434
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,160
He's forcing that seductress upon me.

435
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,680
Both Muen Vorachai and this Lady Chavala

436
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
are the children of Praya Ratanathipok.

437
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
He has unfortunately passed,

438
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,320
but as a Praya,
he did a lot of good for our kingdom.

439
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,680
They weren't born of a common lineage.

440
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,960
But you

441
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,800
harassed the daughter
of a high-ranking nobleman.

442
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,360
Before stating
that they're fabricating the story,

443
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
you must think it through.

444
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,040
He'll be brought
before the magistrate tomorrow.

445
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,920
How shall we overcome this, My Lord?

446
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,880
I can think of one solution, My Lord.

447
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,280
Please have mercy, My Lord.

448
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,360
Khun Suriyonhassadee

449
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,199
has offended not only me,

450
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,360
but also defiled my family's honor.

451
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,520
Lady Chavala.

452
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,000
Is it true that you were kidnapped?

453
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,199
-I--
-Please don't make my sister

454
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,560
say anything, My Lord.

455
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,480
She's already hurt and ashamed
just by sitting here.

456
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,320
Khun Suriyonhassadee

457
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,960
must take responsibility
for this offense, My Lord.

458
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,600
Well, Khun Saengplarn.

459
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,840
Do you have anything to say?

460
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,560
I'd like to hear from Muen Vorachai and…

461
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
Lady…

462
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,840
Is your name Chavala?

463
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,520
-Yes, sir.
-Look at this, My Lord.

464
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,920
He doesn't even respect me and my sister.

465
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,200
My sister's honor has been tarnished.

466
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,480
And he continues to sit here
and refuses to take any responsibility.

467
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,400
What are you talking about, brother?

468
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,320
How do you wish to hold him responsible?

469
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
He must hold a wedding ceremony

470
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,880
to restore my sister's honor, My Lord.

471
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
Wedding?

472
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,320
Aren't we investigating the caravan, Chai?

473
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,960
We can't let that wedding happen.

474
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,920
Please calm down, My Lady.

475
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,880
Please sit right there, My Lady.

476
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Let's go.

477
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,640
That was a reasonable request.

478
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,040
The Khun is also single.
I must ask you two

479
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,040
if you're willing to marry each other.

480
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,040
I'm not marrying him, My Lord.

481
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,040
Va.

482
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,720
This is all untrue.

483
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,040
Khun Saengplarn saved my life.

484
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,200
I can't cause such a burden for him.

485
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,360
I won't marry him, no mat--

486
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,360
Don't say that, my dear.

487
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,880
I've disrespected your honor,

488
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,320
all out of love for you.

489
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,560
In these past few days,

490
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,160
my love for you was burning in my chest.

491
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,200
So, I was too hasty to be with you.

492
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,240
Please accept my apologies.

493
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,480
It was burning in your chest?

494
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,440
Oh, don't pass out just yet.

495
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,040
I know that the love I gave you
is overwhelming.

496
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,880
Come. I'll hold you.

497
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,360
What?

498
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,240
Sir.

499
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Is that really Khun Saengplarn we know?

500
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,040
Hey, he's quite elusive, isn't he?

501
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,320
I have goosebumps.
Harn, does he need to do all this?

502
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,480
I don't know either.

503
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,880
What I did was truly illegal, My Lord.

504
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,840
I laid my hand upon Lady Chavala,

505
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,320
despite her being
neither my wife nor my sister.

506
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
Though it was necessary,
it could still be considered reckless.

507
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,880
It made the people criticize Lady Chavala.

508
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,080
I shall take responsibility

509
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,720
by marrying Lady Chavala, My Lord.

510
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,000
Marry her?

511
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Uh, Harn?

512
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,960
I don't know.

513
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,480
If this can be concluded amicably,

514
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,840
the case will now closed.

515
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,000
The wedding is an auspicious occasion.

516
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,640
I was the one who taught him
royal governance studies.

517
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,800
Congratulations.

518
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
Yes, My Lord.

519
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,440
Hey! Where is everyone?

520
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,600
Laor.

521
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,160
Bring out my palm wine.

522
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,520
I'll treat all the servants
to a feast today

523
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
in celebration
of my sister's impending wedding.

524
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,640
Yes, sir.

525
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
You hated Khun Saengplarn so much.

526
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,720
Why would you want me to marry him?

527
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
You shall go live with him,

528
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
but you must work for me.

529
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
What kind of work?

530
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,720
I have a new master now.

531
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,440
He promised me
the rank of Khun before this year ends.

532
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,000
Chai.

533
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,560
Is your new master
the owner of those wagons?

534
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,880
Brother! You're taking part
in embezzling royal property!

535
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,800
Are you colluding with a corrupt nobleman?

536
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,040
Why would you care about it?

537
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,960
You get to run away from me,
just as you wished.

538
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,400
And I'll be promoted. It's all good.

539
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
I left because you've always been drunk

540
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,240
and fooling around,
yet you kept blaming others.

541
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
We only have each other left.

542
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,200
You can't ever
run away from me in this life.

543
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,440
Let's make a proper deal.

544
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Marry him, and your servants

545
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,880
will not suffer.

546
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,320
But if you disobey my order…

547
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,320
Chai.

548
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,800
Do you understand now?

549
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,440
Is this wedding

550
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,960
a ploy to make them let their guard down?

551
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Yes, My Lord.

552
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,920
They believe they can destroy
my magic with these women.

553
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,560
So, I shall lead them to believe so.

554
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,480
If he decided to use
his own sister as a mole,

555
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,920
then I'll also use her as a mole for me.

556
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,360
Harn.

557
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,560
Go and find out

558
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,880
who Muen Chai is working for.

559
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,000
Yes, sir.

560
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,040
The king considered this to be
the royal-bestowed wedding.

561
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,080
They're now preparing

562
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,360
a large amount of the royal gift.

563
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,320
Pansaeng.

564
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,360
This time,
you're putting your life at stake.

565
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,280
Sir.

566
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,560
Blood is thicker than water.

567
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,080
Lady Chavala
will surely pick her brother's side.

568
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,720
It would be dangerous
to keep her by your side.

569
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm not afraid of a lady.

570
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,760
The more she reveals
what she's capable of, the more likely

571
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
those hidden enemies will emerge.

572
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,960
We'll only benefit from this, My Lord.

573
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,520
I have another concern, sir.

574
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,880
These ladies
have such lovable appearances.

575
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,240
Don't kick me just yet, sir.

576
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,480
Even if this marriage is a mere ploy,
don't you think you'll fall for her?

577
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm worried about that myself.

578
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,560
A sacred vow governs my magic.

579
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,120
If I fall in love with any woman,

580
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,000
I shall be the one
to suffer unbearable pain.

581
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,120
Not even a celestial maiden

582
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,200
would ever be fated to stay by my side.

583
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,480
Did I keep you waiting long?

584
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,160
He's alone.

585
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,080
Who is he talking to?

586
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm talking to you.

587
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,680
Come out.

588
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,720
Whoa.

589
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,080
Khun Saengplarn, sir.

590
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,680
I have some personal matters
to talk to you.

591
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,360
Please forgive my intrusion.

592
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,960
You want to give me a massage, don't you?

593
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,440
Good.

594
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,640
I'm sore all over.

595
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm not here to massage you, sir.
I just want to talk.

596
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,120
You just want to talk? About what?

597
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,760
About something depressing? Or a sad story
about running away to your uncle's home.

598
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,160
Yes.

599
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,720
Then, I'll undress.

600
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,240
Or do you want to undress me?

601
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,240
-What?
-Do it.

602
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,680
-Undress me.
-Sir.

603
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,360
-Do it.
-I won't.

604
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I won't undress you, sir.

605
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,440
Please stop, sir.
Why would you have to undress?

606
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,720
-If you won't, I'll do it myself.
-What?

607
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,400
Sir. Oh.

608
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,800
No massages?

609
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,360
No intimacy? We can just talk then.

610
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,000
Come here.

611
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,040
I shall lie here and wait.

612
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,720
Laor and I will be leaving, sir.

613
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,120
Why do you have to turn
your back on me? Face me.

614
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,920
I said face me.

615
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,360
Yes, sir.

616
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,960
So, Laor and I

617
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,800
have packed our belongings.

618
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,480
You're too far away. Come closer.

619
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,880
Come sit here.

620
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,400
Come.

621
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,800
The two of us
will leave for Phitsanulok tonight.

622
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,680
I am bidding you farewell.

623
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,360
Please forgive me for causing you
trouble, sir. Farewell.

624
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,400
What do you mean you're bidding farewell?

625
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,840
You saved my life twice.

626
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,120
I owe you for your great kindness,

627
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,360
but my brother seized this opportunity

628
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,520
and forced you to marry me.

629
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,880
I don't know what it is my brother wants.

630
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,400
So, I shall flee
from this wedding to end this matter.

631
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,720
Farewell, sir.

632
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,280
Flee from the wedding?

633
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,800
Are you not happy to marry me?

634
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,440
No, sir.

635
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,320
You will only think
I'm setting you a trap.

636
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,080
This time,

637
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,480
I do not know
if I will ever return to Ayothaya.

638
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,560
I shall never forget

639
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,400
all the kindness you've shown me.

640
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,880
In the next life,

641
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,600
I shall be born as your servant, sir

642
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,560
Hey, wait.

643
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
What's that sound?

644
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,880
Khun Saengplarn.

645
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,760
Who are you talking to, sir?

646
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
Did you hear it?

647
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,840
There.

648
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,400
What?

649
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,520
That's the Lady.

650
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Please don't tell anyone I was here.

651
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,920
Hey.

652
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,920
What? Were you visiting
his bedroom, My Lady?

653
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,400
Stop it.

654
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,280
Your wedding will be held next week.
Can't you wait a little longer, sir?

655
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,800
I think he really couldn't wait. Look.

656
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,480
I wonder where his shirt went.

657
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,200
Easy there, sir.

658
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,160
Chavala.

659
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,680
How dare you disobey my order?

660
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,800
You're running away from the wedding?

661
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,320
Ngiam! Jerm!

662
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:37,760
PHITSANULOK

663
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,520
We have arrived at Uncle's home.

664
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,480
Now, we can finally
start our lives over, Laor.

665
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,600
Yes, My Lady.

666
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,200
Uncle.

667
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,400
Va.

668
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,400
Did Uncle…?

669
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,280
How did you arrive so fast?
The messenger just took off on a boat.

670
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,560
Your uncle passed away last night.

671
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,800
Uncle.

672
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,280
Why couldn't you wait
for me a little longer?

673
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,600
You came here alone?

674
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,080
-Yes.
-No.

675
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,600
I'm here with her.

676
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,720
Chai.

677
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,880
You wicked sister.

678
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,680
Uncle isn't around to protect you anymore.

679
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,680
Where will you run this time?

680
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,040
-Chai.
-No!

681
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,480
Wait! What is this, Chai?!

682
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,200
She ran away from her wedding!

683
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,520
She meant to have Uncle reprimand me.

684
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,000
A treacherous sister like her

685
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,640
won't learn without consequences.

686
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,000
Please don't, sir!

687
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,880
-Wait. Can't you just talk to her?
-Please step aside, Aunt.

688
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,880
Brother!

689
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,920
-Va! Please stop!
-You wicked sister!

690
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,880
-Come back with me now.
-Chai!

691
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,200
-Wait!
-Aunt!

692
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,240
Lady Chavala
is really here to see her uncle.

693
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,280
Her brother is truly terrible.

694
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,160
He hits a woman with all his might.

695
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,120
This is beyond human.

696
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,880
They might be acting to fool us.

697
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,080
Before fooling us, he needs
to fool everyone around him first.

698
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,120
We're not dealing
with forest bandits anymore, Ming.

699
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,480
Muen Vorachai is merely
a lower-class nobleman,

700
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,600
but his master

701
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,440
is well-versed
in both governance and warfare.

702
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,760
We can't let our guard down.

703
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,680
<i>Itipi so bhagavā</i>

704
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,320
<i>Araham sammā-sambuddho</i>

705
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,760
<i>Vijjā-carana</i>

706
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,440
<i>Sampanno sugato</i>

707
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,000
<i>Lokavidū, Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi…</i>

708
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,720
If the bride is crying like this,

709
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,200
how would I cover it up, My Lady?

710
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,960
My Lady,

711
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,240
please don't make me worry like this.

712
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,040
If I marry into his household,

713
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,320
only me and Laor will be moving out.

714
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,200
How would my brothers and sisters continue
to live in this house without my help?

715
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,160
Everyone says that
Khun Saengplarn has a bright future.

716
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,360
Perhaps

717
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,000
he'll take us in to serve under him.

718
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Without Uncle,

719
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,520
we have to rely
on a new master to protect us.

720
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,400
Why are you smiling so much?

721
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,320
Didn't you just lose your kin?

722
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,000
-Why are you moving closer?
-Khun Saengplarn.

723
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,360
Sir.

724
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,920
From now on,

725
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,960
could you please protect me?

726
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,480
As well as my servants

727
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,120
and my family's honor.

728
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,360
Could you, sir?

729
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,600
My duties are to take care
of the house, meals, and clothing.

730
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,320
Everything a wife is supposed to do,

731
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,680
I shall do it, and I shall do it well.

732
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,000
Is that all a wife should do?

733
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,640
Chavala prevented me
from ascending to the rank of Khun.

734
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,320
A ghost!

735
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,040
I'm a servant
who takes care of this house, My Lady.

736
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,600
<i>Sawaha, Sawahom</i>

737
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,000
With a lady who charms him
with warmth and grace,

738
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,200
I don't think he can resist for long.

739
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,840
That necklace
was always around my father's neck.

740
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,360
How am I supposed
to face my parents when I die?

741
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,080
Can you see now that it's important?

742
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,040
If you don't want to tolerate this,
then run away.

743
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,040
