1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>I have received</i>
<i>a report from Khun Saengplarn.</i>

2
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,680
He accuses Luang Bovorntat
of assaulting him and his wife.

3
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
I have no wounds…

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,800
…and was not in a fight with anybody.

5
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Why must good people

6
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
fall prey and die?

7
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,200
<i>What it takes to make your lady recover</i>

8
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,040
<i>is nothing other than love.</i>

9
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,360
Even if my bones shatter,

10
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>my muscles burn like fire,</i>

11
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,480
<i>and my spirit descends</i>
<i>into the deepest hell,</i>

12
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,480
I shall love you still.

13
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Live a happy life together for now,

14
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
my cozy little soul.

15
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
Are you going to sleep now?

16
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,680
Yes.

17
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Are you going to sleep now?

18
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,920
Yes.

19
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,320
Well…

20
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,040
The praying hall

21
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,960
is not very comfortable to sleep in.

22
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
So, I think

23
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
I wish to move here.

24
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,920
It is fine. I shall move out.

25
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,440
I shall share a room
with Laor from tonight.

26
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,840
No. No. I shall not…

27
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,600
I shall not be away
from you, even for a minute.

28
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
I will not let you go.

29
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
No…

30
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,160
No, dear.

31
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,840
Please let me…

32
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,800
move back in with Laor like before.

33
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,400
Fine.

34
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,600
Help! Please help!

35
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,840
I am here to report a crime!
Khun Saengplarn is under a love charm!

36
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,600
Help! Please help!

37
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Khun Saengplarn is under a love charm!

38
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,400
Help!

39
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,680
Khun Saengplarn is under a love charm!

40
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,679
Lady Pim?

41
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,760
What are the soldiers doing here, My Lady?

42
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
They are seizing the pandan plants.

43
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Which ones are the most effective?

44
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,400
There are pandan plants

45
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,920
that are more potent than other kinds.

46
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,560
That…

47
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,640
You boil these pandan leaves
for Khun Saengplarn every day, do you not?

48
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, My Lady.

49
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,680
Take these. Seize all pandan leaves.

50
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,600
Please hold on. Why do you need
my pandan leaves, My Lady?

51
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
Hey. Let go of me!

52
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,640
Let me go!

53
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
What is all this?!

54
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
- Chai.
- What a waste of my drinking time.

55
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
Lady Pimpilai has reported

56
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,280
that you and your sister

57
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,880
hired Master Saenkam
to cast a love charm on Khun Saengplarn.

58
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,480
<i>Om.</i> With this magic,

59
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,800
I shall conjure the amoria bloom.

60
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Pansaeng shall fall deeply for Chavala.

61
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,000
I did not know of such a thing, My Lord.
It was not my doing.

62
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
Forgive me, Jaokhun Nakorn.

63
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,920
Has it come to this in Ayothaya,
using mere pandan leaves

64
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,400
to prosecute people?

65
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
- That is true.
- What is this?

66
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
The accusations of the use of dark magic

67
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,920
without any evidence or witnesses

68
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,400
could not be judged by the capital court.

69
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,640
But members of the royal family
shall be able to prosecute one another.

70
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,120
Yes, because--

71
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,840
Because they possess holy water

72
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,360
from the royal praying hall
that can reveal dark magic.

73
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
I shall pour this water

74
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,640
to prove that
these pandan leaves are consecrated

75
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,280
in these two siblings' effort

76
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,760
to put Khun Saengplarn under a love charm.

77
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Dear.

78
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,520
Is it possible that we
are truly under a love charm?

79
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,400
What makes you believe that?

80
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,080
Dear, for months now, we have not

81
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,720
seemed like our usual selves.

82
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,840
I have grown weak
because I betrayed my vow.

83
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
No.

84
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,320
You are willing to die for love

85
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,040
because of this love charm.

86
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,120
If this holy water can prove
that these pandan leaves are consecrated,

87
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
what shall be your ruling, My Lord?

88
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,280
Their union shall be invalidated.

89
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,640
Have you planted
these pandan plants yourself?

90
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Actually, I recall something
only now, My Lord.

91
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Some time before this…

92
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>when I boiled the pandan leaves,</i>

93
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,360
<i>there was truly a foul stench.</i>

94
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,880
<i>It smelled like…</i>

95
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,680
What is this?

96
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
They are special incense sticks.

97
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Special incense sticks?

98
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,400
The smell is pungent. What are they for?

99
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,880
They can arouse physical desire.

100
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,480
Those pandan leaves smelled like
the goods for arousing physical desire.

101
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
She admits it now.

102
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
Is that true, Va?

103
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,840
Yes, dear.

104
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,120
<i>But I have disposed</i>
<i>of the water in that pot…</i>

105
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,680
<i>and removed</i>
<i>all those pandan plants completely.</i>

106
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
Lady Chavala is quick
to fabricate an excuse.

107
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
It was not an excuse.

108
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,920
Please go on and prove

109
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,240
whatever you wish to prove, Lady Pim.

110
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,680
You have been
manipulating him for far too long.

111
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
It is time for you
and your brother to rot in prison.

112
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,800
Dear.

113
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,320
If these pandan leaves turn black,

114
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,280
you must leave Lady Chavala.

115
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,640
Let us finish this.

116
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
These pandan leaves contain no magic.

117
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Impossible.

118
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,680
Your behaviors
were clearly of those under a spell.

119
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Dear.

120
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
We are truly not under any spell.

121
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,480
The feelings between us are genuine.

122
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,920
I am truly willing to die for love.

123
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,480
Well! No magic shall hide

124
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,440
from this holy water.

125
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,480
This holy water has a special property

126
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,960
of preventing any magic or sorcery.

127
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
Once poured over consecrated items,

128
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,840
it shall turn black
and lose all its magic.

129
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,680
We have witnessed that these
are but ordinary pandan leaves.

130
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,240
I shall not be able to prosecute anyone.

131
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,640
This case is dismissed!

132
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
No! No, My Lord!

133
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,080
Khun Saengplarn would never
fall in love with this mere merchant.

134
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
He is under a spell!

135
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,240
It is obvious that he was enchanted!
Can anyone not see?!

136
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,040
I do not believe this.

137
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,760
What a waste of my precious drinking time.

138
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,800
You bigmouth!
Only you knew about this secret!

139
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Please forgive me. I have no recollection

140
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,520
of when I said that, Master.

141
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,400
Both the master and the servant are drunk.

142
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,800
Who is going to recall anything?!

143
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
More importantly,
those are my liquor and my money!

144
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,480
I shall support you no more!
What a waste of resources! Go away!

145
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,200
I have done nothing wrong.

146
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,760
My amoria bloom was potent.

147
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,560
But luck is not on our side!

148
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,680
Pansaeng is not under a spell,
but he is truly weakened.

149
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,600
Yes. Yes.

150
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
He’s not as powerful as he used to be.

151
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,120
We can still get rid of him.

152
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
He must truly be
deeply in love with his wife.

153
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,360
His school

154
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,880
does possess the most severe curse.

155
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,040
He shall not live long.

156
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,120
We must devise a new plan to kill him.

157
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,319
Tian, lift it properly.
Do not play around.

158
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
All right. All right. One.

159
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
- Two. Three.
- Two. Three.

160
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,000
Tian, I said do it properly.

161
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,359
We must get it done tonight. Come.

162
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,440
What are you two doing?

163
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,960
Va told us to move her belongings
to the servant quarters, sir.

164
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,880
I said I'll give her my room.
Why is she so stubborn?

165
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,240
She said she does not wish
to inconvenience you.

166
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,920
So, she will move back there.

167
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,400
No.

168
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,360
No more moving of belongings.

169
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,800
Anyone who does will face me.

170
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
Yes, sir. We shall not move anything.

171
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,680
Bring my belongings
from the prayer hall to this room as well.

172
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,840
Husband and wife
must reside in the same room.

173
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
- The same room.
- The same room.

174
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Right away, sir.

175
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,840
If I cannot move
my belongings out, so be it.

176
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,480
But I will sleep here.
No one can forbid me.

177
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,760
Laor. Fetch my bathrobe.

178
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,240
Va. This may cause a problem.

179
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,160
Bring it to me. Go. I shall take a bath.

180
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,040
Yes, My Lady.

181
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,480
That was fast.

182
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,840
Do you want to take a bath with me, Laor?

183
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,840
Yes.

184
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,960
What?!

185
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,360
Dear?

186
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
When did you come in here?

187
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,760
I worried you would be stubborn,
and I was right.

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,160
Fine. You can sleep in these quarters.

189
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,880
But you must let me sleep here as well.

190
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,040
Dear.

191
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,280
Get up at once.

192
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
- Va.
- Dear.

193
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,400
Why are you throwing your life away?

194
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,480
I am really upset.

195
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,600
Why?

196
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Why are you doing this?

197
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,160
Why?

198
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,480
My cozy little soul.

199
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,960
What is wrong with you?

200
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,320
Why are you being so cold?

201
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,600
You are willing to die for love.

202
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,680
Such unreasonable nonsense.

203
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,320
Others might find this acceptable,

204
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,640
but I will not stand for it.

205
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,520
Va.

206
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Va.

207
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Va.

208
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Your words are utterly unreasonable.

209
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
To see the one you love die slowly?

210
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,480
Who on earth could do that?

211
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,240
Are we in disagreement about this?

212
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes.

213
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,520
If love is truly this dangerous,

214
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,240
perhaps we should stay apart,

215
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,680
- or live as siblings,
- Va.

216
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
or even separate.

217
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,360
- Va!
- Dear!

218
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,680
No.

219
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,760
I have seen you in agony
before my eyes twice now.

220
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,240
That image…

221
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
I shall never forget it.

222
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,360
I am not brave enough
to be by your side anymore.

223
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,920
You chose to die before me.

224
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,000
You are selfish.

225
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,280
Va…

226
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I do not wish to live
for us to bicker in this manner.

227
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
But you have not even tried.

228
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Dear.

229
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,840
Why have you not tried,
even only a little,

230
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,320
to live for me?

231
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,840
How could I?

232
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,360
We must stay apart.

233
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,640
Dear.

234
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,680
The enemies are waiting to kill you.

235
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
You must always stay strong.

236
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,760
Please agree to stay apart, dear.

237
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,680
- Stay at the camp for now.
- No.

238
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,760
I cannot do that.

239
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
Separate? Stay apart? I cannot do that.

240
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,240
Dear…

241
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,360
I am begging you.

242
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,480
Please.

243
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,920
I am truly begging you.

244
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
I am begging you. Please stay far from me.

245
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,080
Va. Va. Listen to me.

246
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,240
Fine. We can stay apart.

247
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
All right?

248
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,880
But I ask for one thing in exchange.

249
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,840
Exchange?

250
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,680
This house is a testament
to my hard work and sacrifice.

251
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,760
It was merely a wood structure
before you came along.

252
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
But thanks to you,

253
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,480
a wood structure became a home.

254
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,560
Dear.

255
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,560
I have not done anything.

256
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,320
I shall never let my wife
stay in the servant quarters.

257
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,480
How can we truly be spouses
without sharing a room?

258
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,920
Sharing a room?

259
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,680
In name only.

260
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,240
To be the symbol

261
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
of our home,

262
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,000
our family.

263
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,520
To be my beloved

264
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,200
and my very essence.

265
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,600
My cozy little soul.

266
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,280
If I agree to reside in the main bedroom,

267
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,800
will you return to the camp?

268
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,560
Yes.

269
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
I shall stay somewhere apart from you.

270
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,000
It is agreed then?

271
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,760
Yes.

272
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,840
My Lady, my name is Chuang.

273
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,520
I was Luang Athikorn's servant.

274
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,280
My wife died because Luang Athikorn
required her blood to offer to the plant

275
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,680
he received from Saenkam.

276
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,040
Saenkam?

277
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,400
Yes.

278
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,920
Were you the one who reported
his crime against your daughter?

279
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,800
Yes.

280
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,080
Shall we try and bring Saenkam
to justice together, My Lady?

281
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
I am now a wanderer without a master.

282
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,720
No one cares about my words.

283
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
No!

284
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
This is enough! We must stop this mess!

285
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,720
Dear.

286
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Saenkam

287
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,640
is supported by some nobles. There is
no way we can hold him accountable.

288
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,840
My daughter's honor
shall only be destroyed further!

289
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
The good nobleman who supports me

290
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,040
is Khun Saengplarn.

291
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,560
He shall help us, sir.

292
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,960
To begin any trial,

293
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,440
we must speak up for all to know

294
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,400
that our daughter has been violated.

295
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,040
Only a mad mother would do it!

296
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,360
I am not mad!

297
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,960
I am fighting for my daughter!

298
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,840
Everyone told me to forget about it,

299
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,320
so Niam would be able to go out
and see people. And look how she is!

300
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,640
Now, she only lies there in despair,

301
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,520
too afraid to go anywhere!

302
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,880
And who was it that delivered her
to that wicked sorcerer?!

303
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,800
Who?!

304
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,080
It was me!

305
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
That is why I must make it right!

306
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,680
I must make everyone realize
that the wicked man was to blame,

307
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,880
not me

308
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,160
or my daughter!

309
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
Do you hear me?!

310
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,960
The victims are not to be blamed!

311
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,560
They are not the evil ones!

312
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,040
Mother.

313
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
The shame belongs
to the one who has wronged us.

314
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,480
You were not wrong.
You need not be ashamed.

315
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,280
Shall you expose him with me?

316
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,440
Niam, my daughter.

317
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,880
Once you go on trial,

318
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,440
will you be able to bear people's gazes

319
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,360
and the questions you must answer?!

320
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,320
I cannot bear it.

321
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,720
I cannot bear it!

322
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Mother…

323
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
Do not cry, my child.

324
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,920
The victim is hurt and ashamed,

325
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,600
while the wicked is at large.
I shall not tolerate this!

326
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,600
Their fate is truly unfortunate.

327
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
But this young lady

328
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
is the only key to exposing
the crimes of Saenkam, sir.

329
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,920
A young lady such as her

330
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,040
must be too ashamed to fight him face-on.

331
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,240
What if there are others?

332
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,880
They may grow in courage.

333
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
Come with me.

334
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,480
Do you wish for me
to spread the word, sir?

335
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,840
Yes.

336
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,520
A market is the best place
for spreading the news.

337
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,880
What am I to tell everyone, sir?

338
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,840
Tell those who have been troubled
by Saenkam's magic to gather in this shop.

339
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,640
If people report his crimes together,

340
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,040
we shall definitely win.

341
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,560
Understood, sir. I shall begin right away.

342
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,800
I shall help spread the word as well.

343
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,520
It takes an army
of commoners to defeat a giant.

344
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,360
Seek out those whom Saenkam has wronged

345
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,680
and convince them to join us.

346
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,160
We have witnessed that these
are but ordinary pandan leaves.

347
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,680
I shall not be able to prosecute anyone.

348
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,440
<i>This case is dismissed!</i>

349
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,360
The law may not be able
to bring you to justice,

350
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,000
but the wheels of karma will turn for you!

351
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,960
No. No. No.

352
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,280
Let the unseen

353
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,600
be seen. Let the unknown

354
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,160
be known. Let the unjust

355
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,960
be just!

356
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,840
I have not had
this nightmare in a long time.

357
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,280
Why has it returned?

358
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,800
You have taken it too far!

359
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,600
We had only one bottle of holy water,
and you have used it up!

360
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,200
If your father or I
were to fall under dark magic,

361
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,760
what would we use?!

362
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
We can easily request
a new bottle, Mother.

363
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,280
Pim!

364
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,800
Abandon your obsession with Pansaeng!

365
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,280
Do you not know that everyone
is speaking ill about you?!

366
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,640
I shall save Pansaeng no matter what.

367
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,120
They have been wed for almost a year.

368
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,080
It is not uncommon
for them to fall in love!

369
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,040
It is indeed uncommon.

370
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,760
That lady is born to a fallen noble.

371
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,600
She is but a lowly merchant.
She has no wealth

372
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,200
and surely cannot help him advance
his career. She does not deserve him.

373
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,800
Pim! You are too far gone!

374
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
My Lady! Please help!

375
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,400
- My Lady!
- What?!

376
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,640
What has happened now?!

377
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,440
Aum is possessed by a ghost!

378
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,800
Aum?! Possessed by a ghost?!

379
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,920
What ghost?!

380
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,080
It is Noi's spirit!

381
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,360
Noi who?!

382
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,720
She is the servant from Muen Vorachai's
household who went missing, My Lady.

383
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
- Huh?!
- Yes!

384
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,320
Aum! What is happening to you?!

385
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Muen Vorachai killed me!

386
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,680
He killed me. I will kill him.

387
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,960
I will kill him.

388
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,440
This is a murder.

389
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,560
We must inform the authorities, My Lady!

390
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,480
It is true, Mother.

391
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
I will kill him. I will kill him!

392
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,760
Stop at once, Aum! I am your lady!

393
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,680
I will kill him.

394
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,040
Va! Va!

395
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,320
Soldiers are taking
Muen Vorachai to court.

396
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,239
What is Chai being held for, Laor?

397
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
For killing Noi.

398
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,199
Killing?

399
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,159
Who made this report? Was it Jerm?

400
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,080
Noi has made the report herself.

401
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,760
Is she not dead?

402
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,800
She is dead and now
possessing Lady Pimpilai's servant.

403
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,600
So, Lady Pimpilai is bringing her
before the authorities.

404
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,240
Jerm! Jerm!

405
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Noi has come!

406
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,440
What did you say? Noi is here?!

407
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,120
She possesses a servant.

408
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
Get dressed and come with me!

409
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,360
Noi, my dear.

410
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,040
At long last, you have come.

411
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Let us go, Saiyud.

412
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,960
Hurry! Let us go!

413
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,800
You cannot start a trial with someone
possessed by a ghost, Pim!

414
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,240
A ghost cannot report a crime, My Lord?

415
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,640
Yes, it cannot.

416
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,000
And you ordered soldiers
to capture Muen Vorachai out of the blue.

417
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,080
If you keep meddling with a case
in this manner, I must inform your father.

418
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,280
If I cannot initiate a trial in court,

419
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,400
shall we let the people be the judges?

420
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,080
Do you see, Uncle?

421
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,960
The citizens are now gathered.

422
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,520
You can only represent the authorities

423
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,480
and watch the situation, Uncle.

424
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,360
What is it you want now?!

425
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,920
Why have you had me captured?

426
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,720
Muen Vorachai!
You killed me. You killed me!

427
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,080
What is this?

428
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
Who are you?

429
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Sir.

430
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,160
Do you not remember your Noi?

431
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,640
I had been your servant since childhood.

432
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,000
My tireless service, day and night,

433
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
seemingly was not enough.

434
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,680
That is why you have killed me.

435
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,520
You have shed my blood
as a sacrifice to a love charm.

436
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,040
Noi's ghost?!

437
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,040
There! He is now trembling.

438
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,000
How could you commit such a cruel act,
killing your own servant?!

439
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,200
Muen Vorachai cast a love charm?

440
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,760
He enchanted Khun Saengplarn
to fall in love with Lady Chavala

441
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,240
using a magical plant from Master Saenkam!

442
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,240
This matter again?!

443
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
Yes.

444
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,320
Do you admit this atrocity, Muen Vorachai?

445
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,080
Muen Vorachai.

446
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,920
You killed me! You killed me.

447
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,560
You killed me.

448
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,440
No!

449
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,120
I have raised you

450
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
and your family!

451
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,640
You had been my servant.

452
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,720
And in death, you shall continue to be so!

453
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Hey! Stop at once!

454
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,560
Hold him! Do something!

455
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Hold him back!

456
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,080
Muen Vorachai!

457
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
How dare you attack
a person right before my eyes?!

458
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,760
- Noi! Noi!
- Noi!

459
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,520
Noi, my dear wife?

460
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,720
Jerm.

461
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,840
Noi.

462
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,080
How have you been?
You are still in my mind.

463
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,760
I am in pain.

464
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,120
They killed me.

465
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,880
We have been looking everywhere for you.

466
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,120
I could not eat or sleep.

467
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,680
How did your life end?

468
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,760
Noi.

469
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,560
I…

470
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,120
I…

471
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,480
Muen Vorachai.

472
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,440
Did you have any accomplices?

473
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
He did.

474
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,360
It was Lady Chavala.

475
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,120
I did not do such a thing.

476
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,360
I was not a part of this.

477
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
Well, ghost of Noi,

478
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,320
why do you not answer Jerm's question?

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,360
How did your life end?

480
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,160
I fell… I fell into the river.

481
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,840
So, how was he able to obtain your blood?

482
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,800
I fell into the river!
I fell into the water!

483
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,400
It was cold.

484
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,680
Noi.

485
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
Where is your body?

486
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,680
In the river. I am in the river.

487
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,760
It is dark.

488
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,200
I cannot see anything.
It is cold. So cold.

489
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,080
I shall bring your remains
to your father in Ban Noen Sung.

490
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
Yes, to my home.

491
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,200
To Ban Noen Sung.

492
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,520
To your father.

493
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,640
You will return to Ban Noen Sung.

494
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,440
I am underwater.

495
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,760
It is dark.

496
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,160
It is so cold…

497
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,960
Noi! Noi! Noi!

498
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,200
- Noi!
- Noi! Noi!

499
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,560
- Noi!
- Noi!

500
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,480
- Noi!
- Noi!

501
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,920
Noi!

502
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,880
It seems her spirit has left the body.

503
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,160
Can we agree now that these siblings have
cast a love charm on Khun Saengplarn?

504
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,840
It seems we cannot agree to that.

505
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,440
The real Noi was not from Ban Noen Sung.

506
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,640
She was from Khoktum,

507
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
and she had no father.

508
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,840
She was an orphan since childhood.

509
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,200
She had only her sister and grandmother.
They all live in Khoktum.

510
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,840
This woman is an imposter!

511
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,080
She was only pretending!

512
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,840
But Muen Voracahi admitted it!

513
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,160
I did not say such a thing.

514
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
When did I admit it?

515
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,000
You are using
your own servant to fool others.

516
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,760
If Noi is truly here,

517
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
why would she not possess
one of Muen Vorachai's people?

518
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
Why did she possess
Lady Pimpilai's servant?

519
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,480
What? What is all this, Pim?!

520
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,960
Lady Pimpilai
has persistently sought to frame

521
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,240
my brother and me
since that last incident, My Lord.

522
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,680
Minister.

523
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,880
She deserves a punishment, My Lord.

524
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,160
No, Uncle.

525
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,280
Lady Chavala surely did cast
a love charm on Khun Saengplarn.

526
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
Uncle.

527
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,080
Everyone, listen to me.

528
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,480
Noi has truly disappeared.

529
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,240
And Muen Vorachai
is close to Master Saenkam.

530
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,920
They were truly using dark magic.

531
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,920
If not, he would not

532
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,440
be trembling with fear for Noi's ghost!

533
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,760
I was furious. I was frightened.

534
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,520
A ghost was about to haunt me,
so I had to suffocate it.

535
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,440
What kind of monster are you
to use my late wife as your ploy?

536
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,760
If it was not
for Khun Saengplarn's warning,

537
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,440
you could have fooled us.

538
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,360
I could truly believe you.

539
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,560
- Sir.
- Sir.

540
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,960
Easy, Jerm.

541
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,800
The spirit of Noi has come, sir.

542
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,880
The spirit you called
has finally come to me.

543
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,440
Everyone wants the spirits
of their loved ones to visit.

544
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,720
We wish to hear their voices.

545
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,680
We wish to see the deceased.

546
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,280
For this reason,

547
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,640
shamans become numerous.

548
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,720
Is this only an imposter?

549
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,720
Jerm, you are the only one who knows

550
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,680
if it is truly her.

551
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,480
Why must you use my wife as your ploy?

552
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,880
They intend to frame my wife.

553
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,440
My Lord.

554
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,760
Lady Chavala

555
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,240
wishes to report
to the Minister of the Capital

556
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,200
an offense of defamation

557
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,120
and conspiracy to damage her reputation.

558
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,200
Yes, My Lord.

559
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,840
I wish to report an offense.

560
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,120
Lady Pimpilai has set
her sights on my husband

561
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,480
and has used one trickery after another.

562
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,720
She has forced her servant
to pretend to be Noi's ghost

563
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,840
and fabricated the story
to frame me and my brother.

564
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,280
Pim. You are beyond saving!

565
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,800
Servant woman, stand up.

566
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,920
Stand up at once!

567
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,720
If not, you shall be flogged

568
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,920
for falsely accusing others!

569
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,640
Please do not flog me.

570
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Who are you?

571
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,600
My name is Aum, My Lord.

572
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,840
Have you been pretending all along?

573
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,600
Please do not flog me, My Lord.

574
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,720
I was only following an order.

575
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,800
Pim, my niece.

576
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
You have truly disappointed me.

577
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,960
Let the trial begin!

578
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,520
Defamation

579
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,160
and false report!

580
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,600
Uncle.

581
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Dear.

582
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,880
Why would you do this to me?

583
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,560
This is your Pim!

584
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,680
For this conflict, Lady Chavala
has reported Lady Pimpilai's offenses.

585
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,320
The accused,
do you confess your transgressions?

586
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,360
Is your lack of response a refusal?

587
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,240
Once your offenses are confirmed,
the full sentence awaits you.

588
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,920
But an immediate confession
shall halve your sentence.

589
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,120
You can choose to confess or deny.

590
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,600
Aum!

591
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,320
I confess, My Lord.

592
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,120
What is your confession?!

593
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,640
I do not know, My Lord.

594
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,560
I do not know a proper speech.

595
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,360
But I do not want to be in prison

596
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,360
or be flogged, My Lord.

597
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,400
Did you impersonate Noi’s spirit?

598
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,720
Yes, My Lord.

599
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,920
The witness and evidence are clear.

600
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,800
I hereby judge

601
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,520
Lady Pimpilai to be guilty
according to the law of Ayothaya

602
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,240
in Book Six,

603
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,360
Section 208.

604
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,000
Those guilty of defamation
face either one month in prison

605
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,440
or compensation
as sought by the aggrieved party.

606
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,880
And Aum, as a servant

607
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,040
who was forced by her master,

608
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,400
has confessed. Hence,
she shall be let go with a warning.

609
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,240
Next time,
she shall receive the full sentence.

610
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,640
Prison, My Lord?

611
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,040
Is it too late to confess now?

612
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,600
Please confess, My Lady.

613
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,840
She has confessed, My Lord.

614
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,240
No.

615
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,440
Your obsession with her
turned you against me.

616
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,560
Dear.

617
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,440
You have become insane.

618
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,680
Do you realize it?

619
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,000
The one who has gone insane
is the one who is obsessed with winning.

620
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,800
It is you, My Lady, not me.

621
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,680
I do love Lady Chavala

622
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,400
for all the good she has done for me,

623
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,480
not because of any love charm, My Lord.

624
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Sir.

625
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,720
We cannot let Lady Pim be imprisoned.

626
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
Please show some respect
to Jaokhun Kaewkarop, your teacher.

627
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,560
Please remember the bond
you have shared with Lady Pim.

628
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,360
Please help her. She cannot be imprisoned.

629
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,160
What did I do wrong?

630
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,360
I only did it out of love for you.
It was purely out of jealousy.

631
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,760
No one would ever love you more than me.

632
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,080
A moment ago,

633
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,440
did you state

634
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,920
that the guilty party
can compensate us, My Lord?

635
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,440
Yes.

636
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,320
Va, no.

637
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
If Lady Pim agrees to cease

638
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,880
her effort to separate us,

639
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,600
I shall accept the compensation
instead of her imprisonment, My Lord.

640
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,680
No.

641
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,200
I demand the nine-gem necklace

642
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,480
that belongs to Lady Chavala's father
to be returned to her.

643
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,200
Did you know

644
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,600
that this necklace
belonged to my father, Lady Pim?

645
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,480
I must know about the one who would
become Khun Saengplarn's wife, for safety.

646
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,040
Laor.

647
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,320
That necklace
was always around my father's neck.

648
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,840
And Chai was senseless enough to sell it.

649
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,600
How am I supposed to face
my parents when I die?

650
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,440
I couldn't protect
any of their possessions, Laor.

651
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,720
- Va.
- I couldn't do anything, Laor.

652
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,920
It's fine, Va. Please do not cry.

653
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,880
Dear, are you aware of that necklace?

654
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,640
Yes.

655
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,600
I demand that Dharmachakra necklace
as compensation.

656
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,680
Yes, My Lord. I shall return it to her.

657
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,840
What of the agreement to leave us alone?

658
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,200
Will you be able to comply?

659
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,600
Yes, I shall leave them alone.

660
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,800
If the agreement has been made,
we shall close this case accordingly.

661
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
This case is dismissed!

662
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,360
Revered Father.

663
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,120
Here.

664
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,080
Oh, Khun Saengplarn!

665
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,400
Greetings, Revered Father.

666
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,880
Dear?

667
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,640
May you be well and happy.

668
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,640
Yes, Father.

669
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,280
- Laor.
- Yes?

670
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,040
Is he not staying at the camp?

671
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,200
He has been staying
in the raft house all along.

672
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Va, where are you going? Va!

673
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,920
Let me.

674
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,840
Yes, sir.

675
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,000
Hm. A lady full of merit

676
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,840
is even more gorgeous.

677
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,000
You have been deceiving me again.

678
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,240
Did you not promise me
that you will stay at the camp?

679
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,280
Va.

680
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,680
Reflect on it well.

681
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,280
What did I truly say that day?

682
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,320
If I agree to reside in the main bedroom,

683
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,160
will you return to the camp?

684
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,480
I shall stay somewhere apart from you.

685
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,440
What I am doing is solely for you.

686
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,600
Oh, Va. When I was residing at the camp,

687
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,000
you were not happy, worrying
if any woman would be with me.

688
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
And now that I am staying closer to you,

689
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,480
you decide to push me away.

690
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,200
Do you not worry
that women would approach me?

691
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,320
Fine.

692
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,080
Stay there if you wish.

693
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,680
Huh?

694
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,000
But I shall not speak to you
or look at you again.

695
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,800
Va… Va!

696
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,560
Va!

697
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,600
Dear! Do not follow me inside.

698
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,200
Mother spoke those words
to Father as well.

699
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,160
She said she would not
speak to him or look at him.

700
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,880
Your mother?

701
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,520
When I was young,
my parents had an argument.

702
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,680
Father wanted me to study martial arts,

703
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,400
but Mother disagreed.
She wanted me to study governance.

704
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,040
She feared I would become a ruffian
who only fights and injures others.

705
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Why are you telling this story?

706
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,640
Family

707
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,400
will fight. They fight out of love.

708
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,280
A home is a place
where people fight out of love.

709
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,080
And at long last,

710
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,840
I have a family of my own.

711
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Thank you,

712
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,000
my cozy little soul.

713
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,240
Have you taken a bath only now?

714
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,160
Yes.

715
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,440
You smell really nice.

716
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,320
Dear. This is enough.

717
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,680
You…

718
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,000
Let us do it this way.

719
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,120
Some time ago, we had been

720
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,760
sending each other flowers

721
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,920
and serenading each other

722
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,080
without even meeting.

723
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,640
We only knew that we had each other.

724
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,360
Do you remember?

725
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,880
I do,

726
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,280
my beautiful lady.

727
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,560
You are even more pretty with time.

728
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,720
Oh, dear. Do not try
to sway me from the matter.

729
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,960
We shall live in that manner.

730
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,000
You have given this main house to me,
so do not come in again.

731
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,560
If you must tell me anything,
let Laor or Tian come to me.

732
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,120
No. No.

733
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,720
It is not worth it.

734
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,520
What was that?

735
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,440
If I must sacrifice my life

736
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,680
for such a cold demeanor,
it is not worth it.

737
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,120
The prize is too meager.

738
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,280
You mean…

739
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,480
What I mean is,

740
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,960
be it this main house,

741
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,280
the raft house,

742
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,320
or the servant quarters,

743
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,040
I shall go

744
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,480
wherever I please.

745
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,000
This arm.

746
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
This shoulder.

747
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,520
This face.

748
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,320
This mouth.

749
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,240
If I wish to do anything to any of them,

750
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,480
I shall be able to do it.

751
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,320
You are a madman.

752
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,760
Dear, leave the house this instance.

753
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,760
I will not talk to you.

754
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,400
You spoke like my mother.

755
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,320
I was so close.

756
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,480
I found my wife's body, sir.

757
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,480
We shall need a thorough plan

758
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,720
to ensure the prosecution
of Luang and Saenkam.

759
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,880
Should all go as planned, in ten days,

760
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,200
we shall lie together.

761
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,160
You, die!

762
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,800
- I surrender!
- Remove his mask.

763
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,720
Yes, sir.

764
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,360
Did you intend to kill me?

765
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,440
What if Luang Bovorntat does not confess?

766
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,080
I have planned everything.

767
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,320
No one

768
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,040
shall escape my grasp.

769
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,960
I think I know where Noi's body is.

770
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,800
Khun Saengplarn has requested
the soldiers to witness the exhumation.

771
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,280
Compose yourself

772
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,360
and look for anything usual.

773
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,120
It was not my doing, My Lord.

774
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,640
Enough with the lies!

775
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,200
Noi, who has been killed,

776
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,640
were holding this watch in her hand!

777
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,240
