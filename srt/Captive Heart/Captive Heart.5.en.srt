1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,280
I want all of you
to sell the goods in the market

2
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
and make some money.

3
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
Come, come. Gather round.
Look at this beautiful hat.

4
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,520
<i>Are you interested?</i>

5
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Shall you take one? Come and take one.</i>

6
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
<i>Aon, stop it. That's a jar.</i>

7
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
Here!

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
-Hey!
-The whetstone!

9
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
It almost hit my foot!

10
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Aren't you invulnerable, sir?

11
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
A stone wouldn't be able to hurt you.

12
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
Pansaeng is chasing our wagons again.

13
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
It is not Pansaeng down there.

14
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,880
Luang Bovorntat.

15
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
You schemed to trick me.

16
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,360
To deal with darkness,

17
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,920
I need to hone dark arts!

18
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
An insurrection?

19
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes, My Lord.

20
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,440
I shall send my good men with you tonight.

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
-Do not let anyone in or out!
-Yes, sir!

22
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,600
Your Majesty, I am

23
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
the Chief Minister, Praya Amorngosee.

24
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,720
The citizens live in peace and prosperity.

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,760
The affairs in the palace
are peaceful and orderly, Your Majesty.

26
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,720
I shall report that
our nation is at peace, Your Majesty.

27
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,600
Taxes were collected properly.

28
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,960
The crops are plenty, Your Majesty.

29
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,440
I shall report
on the security of our nation.

30
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,040
All is well, and no troubling matters
have arisen, Your Majesty.

31
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,560
How was it, My Lord?

32
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,960
All morning, I’ve listened,
but no mention of Luang Bovorntat’s crime

33
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,640
Praya Thammanart must have betrayed us.

34
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
He did not arrest Luang Bovorntat.

35
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,920
My Lord.

36
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,720
Is there any reason
you did not seize Luang Bovorntat?

37
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,600
We shall talk outside.

38
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
You are the Minister of the Treasury.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,800
Your duty is to purge those who wrongfully
profit from our kingdom's wealth.

40
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
That is your duty, My Lord.

41
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,800
These swords

42
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,280
are much needed for my kin in the North.

43
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,640
Hence, I sent them through my caravan.

44
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Why does the North need all these swords?

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
For an insurrection?

46
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
What are you talking about, My Lord?

47
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,880
These illegal goods

48
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
shall be seized by the authority.

49
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,920
I shall make sure
you profit from this as well.

50
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
It was not as you thought.

51
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,280
It was but a misunderstanding.

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,400
No one was planning an insurrection.

53
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,880
And you believed him?

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,840
I did.

55
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Luang Bovorntat holds a high rank.

56
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
His words are to be trusted.

57
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
The weapons

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
are prohibited goods
and cannot be sold by citizens.

59
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
They are undoubtedly illegal.

60
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,800
He is our ally.

61
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Do not be too serious.

62
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,480
But someone as upright and hostile
as you should be careful,

63
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
or you shall end up in prison.

64
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
I wonder if being an ally

65
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
is truly important, My Lord.

66
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Please allow me to question you,
Praya Thammanart.

67
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,840
Who truly is Luang Bovorntat?

68
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
His older sister

69
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
was the royal consort
to the previous king.

70
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,480
His father

71
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,800
is familiar with Jaokhun Singh.

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
His wife

73
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,280
is the daughter of Jaokhun Amorn,

74
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,400
the Chief Minister.

75
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,080
Then I shall ask all of you, My Lords.

76
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Between alliance

77
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
and law,

78
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,120
which is more important?

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,760
What are you talking about?

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,040
The law states that

81
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,120
there are two means
of achieving civil servant positions.

82
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,200
One, by virtue.

83
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
Selection shall be made
according to morals.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,360
Two, by the ability and worthiness.

85
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,960
But in reality, we have
never used these two means.

86
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
We have relied solely on cronyism,

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,200
which has led civil servants
to become slothful,

88
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,200
since there are no consequences.

89
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,520
More importantly,
there is no accountability.

90
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,280
All because of being an ally.

91
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
Pansaeng.

92
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,680
From all of that,
what are you trying to say?

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
For the citizens, the law

94
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,240
is their only protection
against injustice.

95
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,880
But cronyism seems to be above the law.

96
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
If the citizens have nothing to rely on,

97
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,400
their only option

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,120
will be to cause an uprising.

99
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,160
And it shall be the end
of Ayothaya in no time!

100
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,840
Insolent!

101
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,520
This is the place
for the high-ranking nobles.

102
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,720
Someone like you should get out.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,240
Luang Bovorntat is amassing arms
for the insurrection.

104
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
How dare you accuse me, you bastard?!

105
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,520
You've hidden arms, saltpeter,

106
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
and sulfur in the barn out of town.

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,640
I have evidence and witness,

108
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
but I couldn't bring him to justice.

109
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,360
I shall inquire
of every one of you noble families.

110
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,320
Do you defend his honor

111
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,120
or conspire with him in rebellion?

112
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
Stop at once, Pansaeng!

113
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
You have evidence?

114
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
I think not.

115
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,680
Criminal Code of the Kingdom, Section 16.

116
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,720
Accusing anyone without proof
is considered defamation.

117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
Chief Minister.

118
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,480
Would you please

119
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,880
bring him to justice
and protect my honor, My Lord?

120
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,000
Put him in the capital prison.

121
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,000
In three days, we shall put him on trial.

122
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,520
So, this fish meal is light

123
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,520
and suitable for eating while traveling.

124
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
You should make more.

125
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,720
And to reach Mueang Khon,

126
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
how long shall it be?

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,680
We shall leave as a merchant boat caravan.

128
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
So, we must sell goods along the way.

129
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,320
I believe it shall be nearly three months.

130
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,280
But I had the boats made.
It shall be finished soon.

131
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,360
Is it enough?

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,400
My Lady! My Lady!

133
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
What is it, Tian?

134
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
Those at the camp told me

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that Khun Saengplarn was imprisoned

136
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
in the capital's prison!

137
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
Sir.

138
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Why are you here?

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
How long must you stay here?

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,320
The punishment for defamation
is one year imprisonment.

141
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
But with how unlawful this nation is,

142
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
I may be kept here forever.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,960
Please calm yourself.

144
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,600
I believe Jaokhun Singh
is finding a way to help you.

145
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,160
I have lost all hope.

146
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,640
I couldn't even rely on the Minister.

147
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
Sooner or later,

148
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,080
the citizens shall be harmed by the war.

149
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
What is meant to be, shall be.

150
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
I've brought you the meal.

151
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,120
Well, I heard the food here is terrible.

152
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,240
I hope you do not fear
that I would poison you.

153
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,560
And you…

154
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,400
When shall you depart on your journey?

155
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,720
It is next week.

156
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,040
My apologies.

157
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,400
Since I couldn't help your servants,

158
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,760
you are forced to leave.

159
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
You have always been
doing everything for Ayothaya.

160
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
You shouldn't have had to face this.

161
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,520
Here.

162
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
It is a bullet wood-infused candle.

163
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
It shall soothe your mind

164
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,280
and grant you restful sleep.

165
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,400
Lady Va.

166
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,800
Do not forget to take the royal-bestowed
gold in the bedroom with you.

167
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,080
And I wish you luck.

168
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,960
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
This is Lady Pimpilai,

170
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
the daughter of the Minister
of the Royal Household.

171
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,520
Why won't you let us enter?

172
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,920
We cannot allow you, My Lady.

173
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,880
Then why was this woman able to?

174
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,440
To visit the prisoner,
you must only be the wife

175
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,640
or the family, My Lady.

176
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,040
What did you do inside?

177
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,720
I've brought him a meal, My Lady.

178
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
Someone like you could only offer food.

179
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,920
A mere merchant
wouldn't be able to give him more.

180
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,119
He is having a hard time.

181
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,240
And I am busy.
I do not have time to bicker.

182
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,520
All have been seen to, as I commanded.

183
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,440
Stay and see
what I did for Khun Sangplarn.

184
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,079
Greetings, Uncle.

185
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,320
The problem with this
insolent bastard never ends.

186
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes, sir.

187
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
Dear.

188
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,000
My dear.

189
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,400
Lady Pim?

190
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,640
All is fine now.

191
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,640
Jaokhun Amorn has agreed to release you.

192
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,400
Release me, My Lady?

193
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,120
Yes. I pleaded with him.

194
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,120
Were you to marry Lady Pim?

195
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,760
Yes, Uncle.

196
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,120
At the close of this month.

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,800
You are to be the son-in-law
of the Minister of the Royal Household.

198
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
I truly don't know why Jaokhun Kaew

199
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,760
would choose a man such as you.

200
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,840
We have been in love for a long time,
before anyone else.

201
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,680
Jaokhun Amorn.

202
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,920
Would you release him

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,040
only because he is to be
the in-law of the Minister,

204
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
My Lord?

205
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,880
Jaokhun Kaew and I

206
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,400
are cousins.

207
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,960
And I did this out of love for my niece.

208
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,080
After the wedding,
you must change how you behave.

209
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,720
The power above the law.

210
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,040
Ally.

211
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,440
Should I be freed for this reason,

212
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I implore you to grant me
the trial I am due, My Lord.

213
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,600
You! Again with your nonsense!

214
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,880
Dear.

215
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,600
There are powers
above the law in every corner.

216
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,400
The magic you practice

217
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,240
must also stem from your deep desire

218
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,280
to wield the power above the law.

219
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,920
A kingdom that follows
only the law shall fall.

220
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,360
Please reconsider.

221
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,920
To reach higher ranks,

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,240
you must learn to compromise,

223
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,200
like bamboos that yield to the wind.

224
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,800
They shall stand firm
against storms for long.

225
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,360
But being as unyielding as you,

226
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,040
you shall remain
but a short-lived banyan tree.

227
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,000
You have my thanks, Uncle.

228
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,920
My heartfelt thanks to you, My Lord.

229
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Pim.

230
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
Yes?

231
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,960
Take good care of your soon-to-be husband.

232
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
Next time, I shall not be able to help.

233
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,480
Yes.

234
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,920
You should get some rest.

235
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
Lady Pim went through much trouble

236
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,640
to do you such a favor, sir.

237
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,840
You have my thanks, Lady Pim.

238
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,880
I told everyone
we shall wed by this month.

239
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,920
Thus, their hearts were eased
and forgiveness was given.

240
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,360
I am a lady who can protect you

241
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
while others couldn't.

242
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,480
Do you understand now?

243
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,800
Protecting him
by using your position and status

244
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,560
to threaten others, My Lady?

245
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,440
A truly honorable merit.

246
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
Regardless,

247
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,760
people already know
that I shall marry him.

248
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,320
Should we not proceed, it shall be deemed
deceit toward the royal palace

249
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,760
and ingratitude to my father.

250
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,680
The future of his career shall be grim.

251
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,080
The wedding is imminent.

252
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,680
I shall prepare everything
at Khun Saengplarn's house tomorrow.

253
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
It is untidy and filthy,

254
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,560
unfit for Lady Pim to live in.

255
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,800
Good, Pao.

256
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Permission granted.

257
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,560
You have indeed gone too far this time.

258
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,560
You knew that there was no proof,
yet you spoke such words.

259
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,160
If you mean to forsake the prevention
of this insurrection, pray inform me.

260
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,320
I shall immediately
form my band of outlaws to rival Prai’s.

261
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,280
Pansaeng.

262
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
What is wrong with you?

263
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,840
My Lord.

264
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The law is supposed to prevent injustice.

265
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,440
It is justice for people of all classes.

266
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,080
It is the only thing
to help good men survive.

267
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,240
Without it,

268
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
I no longer have any hope, My Lord.

269
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,720
You pray every night.

270
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
Yet I see no man of virtue

271
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,600
but only the devil.

272
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,240
The devil full of sadness

273
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,680
and vengeance.

274
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,960
My Lord, I do not understand.

275
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,400
Once we light the fire

276
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,440
that burns up with vengeance,

277
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
you yourself shall catch that fire

278
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,600
and die with it in no time.

279
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,600
It is you at the moment.

280
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,640
But I did everything for justice.

281
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
This is not justice,

282
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
but your fear of defeat.

283
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,160
You have shattered
the honor of all the noblemen

284
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,520
because those people

285
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,960
failed to prevent your father's death.

286
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
I was reckless.

287
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,920
Please forgive me, My Lord.

288
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,680
Listen, my son.

289
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,000
Great victories

290
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,040
always come with small defeats.

291
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,400
You must learn to accept defeat at times

292
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
to achieve a greater victory.

293
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
Do not leave any inside.

294
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Wait. What is all this?

295
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,240
Lady Pimpilai shall marry into this house,
hence, I am arranging the kitchen.

296
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,440
Everything must be clean,
not filthy like this.

297
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,000
If you get rid of all my tools,
what shall I use this evening?

298
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,800
It doesn't concern me. I am doing my job.

299
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
We shall have an auspicious event soon.

300
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,760
Do you wish for me to use those old wares

301
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
to prepare royal court cuisine
for our esteemed guests?

302
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,680
We shall not do it.

303
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,120
I have cleaned everything properly.

304
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,760
I think you are trying to drive us away.

305
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,720
It seems you have realized it.
Move yourself

306
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,440
and your lowly lady away at once.

307
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,560
Go home and do not waste
our time driving you out.

308
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,960
Lowly? You seem to like this word.

309
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You…

310
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,160
Stop it.

311
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,200
Va.

312
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
She said you are only a lowly lady.

313
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,160
We’re all human.
How could she say such a thing?

314
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,080
Laor. Knowing that their souls are filthy,

315
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
why should you get your hands dirty?

316
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,400
Who are you calling filthy?

317
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,360
In a few days,
we shall move to Mueang Khon

318
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,560
and no longer be here. Do as you please.

319
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Do you plan to leave
Khun Sangplarn for good

320
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,280
or only seek attention?

321
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Living with Lady Pim as a family?

322
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,440
High or low is hard to see.
Good or bad is much easier.

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,440
I assure you we shall leave.

324
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,080
We may have little and go hungry,

325
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,680
yet being with good people
feels like heaven.

326
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
With bad people,

327
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,680
grand halls and fine food

328
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
shall only feel like a living hell.

329
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,320
-You…
-Your hands and your filthy mouth!

330
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,520
You must…

331
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,040
come from the deepest hell.

332
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,120
Go.

333
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,320
Wait.

334
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,160
Return my wares. Put them down.

335
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,120
You promised to work for me

336
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
but never watched the checkpoint!
They have found my barn!

337
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,440
My apologies, My Lord. From now,

338
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,800
I shall personally watch the checkpoint.
I shall start anew.

339
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,640
You did nothing but flatter me!

340
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,680
You could not achieve anything!

341
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,400
Ouch!

342
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,840
For this madness,
you shall be held accountable!

343
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,160
My Lord!

344
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,920
Beat him up!

345
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Now, harder!

346
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
-Good.
-Keep your arms away from the blades.

347
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
-Hold it tighter. Right.
-Good.

348
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
There.

349
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,400
Yong.

350
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Come.

351
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Look.

352
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,720
What do you think he's thinking?

353
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
Surely, a plan to defeat Luang Bovorntat.

354
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,360
I still remember how he betrayed us.

355
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,600
It is far greater than that.

356
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,560
The Minister himself is corrupt.

357
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,560
Ayothaya shall be ruined.

358
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,840
But I do not think it is.

359
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,960
It is about the wedding.

360
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,480
Well, Lady Pimpilai
is beautiful, yet frightening.

361
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,000
How shall he escape from her now?

362
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,400
Am I correct?

363
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,680
Good. Kill me. Go ahead and kill me.

364
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,520
I sell all the goods every day

365
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,880
without sleep, just to pay off the debts!

366
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,600
The debts that I didn't even cause.

367
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,400
I did good all my life, and what do I get?

368
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,160
The one who's despicable

369
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,080
still remains despicable.

370
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,840
He doesn't think for a second to repent.

371
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,280
-Help me! Help!
-Sir.

372
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
-Sir.
-Help me.

373
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,720
And what is it you are doing?

374
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
I am seeing Ayothaya.

375
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,400
Soon, I shall no longer see it.

376
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,240
The boats are finished.

377
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,160
Full moon at two in the morning,
we shall depart for Mueang Khon.

378
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
What are you planning?

379
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,280
Where did you get this much money?

380
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,360
Are you keeping the money from me?

381
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,680
Sir.

382
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,640
There are provisions here as well, sir.

383
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,640
Ngiam!

384
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
It must be for a journey.

385
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,920
Sir.

386
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,880
Are you running away from me?

387
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,080
Sir, please don't. Please.

388
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,880
Aon! Saiyud, get away!

389
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,680
Saiyud! Chai!

390
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,960
My Lady!

391
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,280
You wicked sister!

392
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,840
You plan to leave me
and take my people with you.

393
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,800
Gather all the servants
at the main hall. Now!

394
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,040
Ngiam!

395
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,239
Stop, Ngiam!

396
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,679
Ngiam!

397
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
Ngiam!

398
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,320
-Lady Va.
-Are you hurt, Saiyud?

399
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,800
Aon, are you injured?

400
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,880
Chai.

401
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,040
I am the son!

402
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,000
All the servants of my parents

403
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,760
belong to me!

404
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,679
Chavala. Do you see
all the wounds on my face?

405
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,080
They are all here because of you!

406
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,840
How could you blame me for your actions?

407
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Luang Bovorntat
punished me because of you!

408
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,159
You have failed to do your task!

409
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,920
Your husband constantly troubled him,

410
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,480
and you did nothing to help me

411
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,400
to get rid of your husband.

412
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,320
Fine. If I am in pain,

413
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,360
I shall give you pain as well!

414
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,600
You wicked sister!

415
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,520
-Ngiam!
-Yes, sir!

416
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,840
Tie her to a post.

417
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,080
Chai. Chai.

418
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,320
-Please.
-Ngiam.

419
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,240
-Please don't, sir!
-Ngiam!

420
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
-No.
-My Lady!

421
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,040
-My Lady.
-Chai.

422
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,240
-Ngiam!
-Let go of me!

423
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,680
-I shall not go!
-Ngiam!

424
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,600
Ngiam! She is your lady!

425
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,320
Do not hurt her! Let her go, Ngiam!

426
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,720
Let me go, Ngiam! Ngiam!

427
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,040
-Let me go!
-Ngiam! Stop!

428
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,280
Ngiam!

429
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Back off, you lot!

430
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,600
Ngiam, let me go.

431
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,200
Ngiam! Untie her!

432
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,320
Ngiam! Let her go!

433
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
I beg you!

434
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,480
You bitch!

435
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
Aon! Saiyud!

436
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,520
Father. Mother.

437
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,040
It is the curse of our house

438
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,880
to bear such a monster for an heir.

439
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,960
Please let me be in your presence

440
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
and never again
cross paths with one so vile.

441
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,480
You wicked sister!

442
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
You!

443
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,520
Saiyud!

444
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,920
Move! Do you wish to try me?!

445
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
Saiyud!

446
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,800
Aon!

447
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,560
Saiyud, Aon, get away!

448
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,880
Aon! Saiyud, Aon, move!

449
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,640
Sir! What is that?!

450
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,200
Aon…

451
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,360
Are you wounded?

452
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,520
No, sir. Thank you.

453
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,960
You need not interfere, sir.

454
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,800
I am dealing with my people.

455
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
This lady is not one of your people.

456
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,440
She is mine.

457
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,560
Chavala

458
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,280
plans to run away from Ayothaya.

459
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,400
Are you aware? How could you allow her?

460
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,600
I knew it long ago.

461
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
I gave her permission.

462
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,400
But I shall not allow her.

463
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
If she wishes to leave, she can go alone.

464
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
But she is taking my subjects with her.

465
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,240
I shall not allow it!

466
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,960
Well then.

467
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,880
You are free to take her back,

468
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
and do not ever let her
come back to this house again.

469
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,720
Do not let her meddle
with my people again.

470
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,120
I shall not go with him, Chai.

471
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
I was about to depart.

472
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,680
Aon. Saiyud. Pack your belongings.
We shall go now.

473
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,480
Go.

474
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,720
Yes, Va.

475
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,320
Spending nights in a temple
is better than dying here by his rod.

476
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,280
Go, Aon, Saiyud.

477
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,560
No one shall go anywhere.

478
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,840
Good people shall stay in Ayothaya.

479
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,000
Lady Va and her people in this house

480
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,040
shall be under the protection
of Khun Suriyonhassadee from now on.

481
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,480
No one shall ever lay hands on them.

482
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,040
You bastard! You have no rights!

483
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,320
You are breaking the law.
I shall report this.

484
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,360
You need not
concern yourself with it, sir.

485
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,640
You were only just freed from prison.

486
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,480
I rarely wield black magic against anyone,

487
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,600
since it doesn't affect good people
protected by merits and angels.

488
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,800
But with a vile man such as you,
it shall do the deed,

489
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,680
for the pain you caused others
shall return upon you.

490
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,200
Nonsense.

491
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,680
It is but a child's play.

492
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,760
I hereby summon the damned spirits
to torment this cursed man.

493
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,920
I hereby summon evil spirits to feast upon
your sinister soul, Muen Vorachai.

494
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,400
This is the curse and command
you shall remember.

495
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,040
Whenever you threaten
the body and mind of your sister

496
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,520
or any of these servants again,

497
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,480
the talisman inside you shall burn up.

498
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,480
Your gut shall get boiled.

499
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,400
Your organs shall be twisted.

500
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,680
You shall be in pain

501
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,760
and moan till you die.

502
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,720
Please spare me!

503
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Everyone. We have survived. Laor!

504
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,280
Saiyud! Aon!

505
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,160
We have survived.

506
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,440
I and all the servants

507
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,640
humbly thank you, sir.

508
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,760
We are willing to be your subjects.

509
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,440
From now on, we shall be your servants

510
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,960
till the day we die, sir.

511
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,240
Why are you being so stiff?

512
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,960
You have told me to go,
and today you prevented me from leaving.

513
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,520
What should I be doing?

514
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,880
You need not leave.

515
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,520
You look like…

516
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,320
you have something in mind.

517
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,800
You have been looking serious.

518
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,360
My life has been confusing lately.

519
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,720
I know not what I ought to do,
nor what I ought not to do.

520
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,920
What is right or wrong?

521
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,400
I do not know at all.

522
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
What is in your mind, sir?

523
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,400
I have never wielded black magic before.

524
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,640
My school trained me in white magic.

525
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,320
Normally, black magic
does not affect those of virtuous hearts.

526
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,240
You were frightening today.

527
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,520
My master told me

528
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,040
that once we use black magic
against someone,

529
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,840
they shall get back with black magic.

530
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,440
Eventually, there shall only
be black magic left.

531
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,560
And the good magics shall vanish

532
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,240
once people lose all faith in them.

533
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
A fleeting victory, perhaps?

534
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,920
One day, your brother

535
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,600
shall return to harm you

536
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,400
and exact his revenge upon me.

537
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,040
The same goes for my work.

538
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,000
When I return, there shall be
countless new enemies waiting.

539
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,240
My career is in jeopardy.

540
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,520
With everything
so overwhelming, I feel that

541
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,920
I need a break.

542
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,600
Sir.

543
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,160
Could you dock the boat at that pier?

544
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,760
How did you find such a place?

545
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,800
Were you here by yourself?

546
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,200
I was with Laor.

547
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,520
We were selling goods until late
and stumbled upon this place.

548
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,040
I can see the whole Ayothaya.

549
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,000
Ayothaya is beautiful.

550
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,960
Its beauty is to die for.

551
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,640
When I heard such words,
I truly admired the speaker.

552
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,200
Today,

553
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,520
you may feel disheartened,

554
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,520
but I am truly happy

555
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,000
that I need not leave this city.

556
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,120
Here, the shadows of my parents

557
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,280
cast warmth upon me.

558
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,000
The same goes with my servants
you have helped today.

559
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,000
They shall sleep soundly from now on

560
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,280
without being scared.

561
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,080
Can you see those fireflies there?

562
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,480
Right there.

563
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,280
Small lights may not mean victory.

564
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,840
Victory is not yours yet.

565
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,960
Perhaps it shall never be.

566
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,600
True.

567
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,120
You may not achieve victory…

568
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,280
but in the darkness,

569
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,520
small lights suffice.

570
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,160
You are a small light
to a hopeless one such as myself.

571
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,600
You told me that Chai
would return, but I care not.

572
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,520
I only know that today I have some hope.

573
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,600
Only hope is enough.

574
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,440
Watch closely.

575
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,560
Look at all this.

576
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,600
When we offer small hopes to others

577
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,720
and all hopes continue to accumulate,

578
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,960
how beautiful it becomes.

579
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,880
This world may never know victory,

580
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,400
yet it never loses hope

581
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,840
because of someone such as you.

582
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,280
My parents

583
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,560
had tried to groom Chai to be like you.

584
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,400
To be someone people can rely on.

585
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,040
I used to gaze upon you

586
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,400
and think, if you truly were my brother,

587
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,680
I should be the happiest girl alive.

588
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Sir.

589
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,040
If I were to address you

590
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,240
as "dear", as in "dear brother",
would you be content with it?

591
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,720
Can I?

592
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,760
Maybe.

593
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,960
Being siblings is fine.

594
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,760
I have a new brother now.

595
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,320
Dear.

596
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,320
Your smile…

597
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,680
truly irritates me.

598
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,640
From now on,

599
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,560
please take care of the house.

600
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,800
Perhaps I shall be at the camp.

601
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,560
What?

602
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,720
Won't you return home at all?

603
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,960
I shall let you take care
of the house. So, it is yours.

604
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,320
We shall each do our duty.

605
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,240
Do you mean
we shall each live our own life?

606
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,520
Somewhat so.

607
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,080
But if

608
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,040
we are to live apart,
how can we call ourselves siblings, dear?

609
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,360
This is what siblings do.

610
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,560
Your brother lives in
a different house from yours,

611
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,120
yet he still is your brother, is he not?

612
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,800
Fine.

613
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,120
So long as you do not forget me,

614
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,400
I shall tend to your house,

615
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,960
deliver you meals,

616
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,000
and do everything

617
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,720
as you wish.

618
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,440
I have just recalled.

619
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,440
Tomorrow, I shall need
your help with something.

620
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,320
Father has requested
that your elder representative

621
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,520
meet with him next week

622
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,400
to discuss the bride’s gifts
and the auspicious date.

623
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,320
-Well…
-But I actually

624
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,320
have the date in mind.

625
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,960
Shall we wed on…?

626
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,160
Hold on a moment, Lady Pim.

627
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,640
Please forgive me, but…

628
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,080
I

629
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,680
shall not be able to marry you.

630
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,440
Please allow me
to repay your kindness in other ways.

631
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,160
Why? Why may you not wed me?

632
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,960
Because my wife
does not permit it, My Lady.

633
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,920
Lady Va.

634
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,520
You did forbid me.

635
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,840
I forbade you?

636
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,640
Lady Va.

637
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,120
Lady Va.

638
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,560
Do not do this.

639
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,800
You need not be embarrassed.

640
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,120
<i>If you place this upon me,</i>

641
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,720
<i>Lady Pim would loathe me</i>
<i>through all our lifetimes.</i>

642
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,400
<i>I shall not partake.</i>

643
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,240
Lady Pim.

644
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,280
Khun Saengplarn doesn't wish to marry you

645
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,600
because he truly loves me.

646
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,480
What? Dear.

647
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,400
Why do you not tell Lady Pim
that you love me?

648
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,200
Dear. Tell Lady Pim

649
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,480
how deeply you are in love with me.
Are you in love with me?

650
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
-Dear.
-Uh, I…

651
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
I love Lady Va.

652
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,320
I love Lady Va dearly.

653
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,960
I love Lady Va.

654
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,800
<i>I shall collect myself.</i>

655
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,000
<i>I am collecting myself.</i>

656
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,560
You have met Lady Va
only once at the market.

657
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,040
Then came the trouble in the woods.

658
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,280
After that, you have confessed
your love for her during the trial.

659
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,640
Is it not somewhat strange?

660
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,000
What truly transpired, dear?

661
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,560
No answers.

662
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,400
Well, next question.
Why does the master bedroom

663
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,160
has only your belongings

664
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,680
and none of Lady Va's, dear?

665
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,840
You have not bedded each other, have you?

666
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,120
Your face reveals all.

667
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,040
If there seems to be
an unknown reason for your union,

668
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,280
then why can you not marry me, dear?

669
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,240
Lady Pim.

670
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,360
Do not give your heart
to one who loves you not.

671
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,920
It shall not be worth it.

672
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,960
It shall be.

673
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,680
I am in the same situation as Lady Va.

674
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,880
I must wed you out of necessity.

675
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,040
And should you refuse,

676
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,880
Jaokhun Amorn and Luang Bovorntat

677
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,280
may hold you accountable at any time.

678
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,360
I shall wait until it happens, Lady Pim.

679
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,960
But I cannot marry you,

680
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,560
for you seek only to win.

681
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,920
Stop. It is enough, My Lady.

682
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,760
Dear.

683
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,160
What are you lot looking at?

684
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,280
This is Lady Pimpilai,
the daughter of the Minister.

685
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,640
Is this a military camp
or a den of thieves?

686
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,680
Stop right there.

687
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,960
No one shall lay hands upon my people.

688
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,840
She wed you only to leech off your wealth.

689
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,800
I shall give all to her.

690
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,920
-I shall give all to her.
-I shall give all to her.

691
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,400
<i>Mong, Mong, Teng, Mong. Woo!</i>

692
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,000
Are you this serious, dear?

693
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,480
I am serious because I shall
come live here as well.

694
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,520
-Huh?
-Khun Phra!

695
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,800
He is Khun!

696
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,160
Spicy Boiled Eggs Salad
with Pickled Garlic.

697
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,040
This food shall help us

698
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,120
get excited tonight.

699
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,520
What did she mean by excited?

700
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,440
Tonight,

701
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,440
shall we take a bath together?

702
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,920
Please take a bath with me, dear.

703
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,520
