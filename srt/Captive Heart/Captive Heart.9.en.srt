1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
Your duty

2
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,640
is to plant amoria blooms
in place of pandans.

3
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
You there.

4
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
A ghost!

5
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,240
Va. Noi has been missing for three days.

6
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,240
What happened?

7
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
- Noi!
- Noi!

8
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
- Noi!
- Noi!

9
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
Noi!

10
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,880
I have retrieved the belongings
of Pansaeng and Chavala.

11
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,000
<i>This is the magical amoria bloom.</i>

12
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,240
Pansaeng shall fall deeply for Chavala.

13
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,840
<i>He shall yearn for her and desire her.</i>

14
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
Sir!

15
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,280
It hurts. Please let me go.

16
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
Being far from you is painful!

17
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,880
But if I am this close to you,
how would it feel? Huh?!

18
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
Sir!

19
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
Lady Va!

20
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,680
Sir! Sir!

21
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,320
Sir.

22
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,240
You are awake.

23
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,440
I shall fetch your medicine.

24
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,200
What is it you are doing?

25
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
I shall massage you,

26
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
so that your blood flow better, sir.

27
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Chai.

28
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
When you collapsed,

29
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Chai was coming to visit.

30
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,360
He helped carry you here.

31
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,240
I am feeling better now.

32
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Mor Thongpin looked at you
and said you have a fever.

33
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,320
He prescribed some medicine.

34
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,080
Please have some.

35
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
Get up slowly.

36
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,120
Here.

37
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,400
Easy.

38
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,200
Even one as formidable as yourself
now suddenly lies abed.

39
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
It is most unbelievable.

40
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,760
If you are trying to lift my curse,

41
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
I shall return

42
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,280
to your house
and conjure it inside you again.

43
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,520
I am afraid now, sir.

44
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,080
I have truly changed my ways.

45
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,120
The master of the dark arts

46
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
that Luang Bovorntat worships

47
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
is Taen Seenil.

48
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,480
He is known to be the most cruel.

49
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You

50
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
should try to step away.

51
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,400
Taen Seenil?

52
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,720
Is it the name of a sorcerer thief
from long ago, sir?

53
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,720
These people

54
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
considered you nothing but a small pawn.

55
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,840
If you are in league with them,

56
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,880
they shall only step on you

57
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,080
and let you die eventually.

58
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,240
Pansaeng is surely facing illness
from amoria bloom.

59
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,840
He thinks that I am still under his curse.

60
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
Little does he know that you

61
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,640
have already lifted my curse.

62
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
My Lord,

63
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,160
your magic is truly
more powerful than Pansaeng's.

64
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,760
Shall we strike Pansaeng tonight, My Lord?

65
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,360
No! It is too soon, and too risky.

66
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Why?

67
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
His lust shall double over time,

68
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
and his magic
shall eventually be faded away.

69
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,880
His body will weaken steadily,

70
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,160
until the day

71
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,680
he shall die without our effort.

72
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
How long shall it be?

73
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,760
At least three months.

74
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,880
It is far too long!

75
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,280
To become king,
you must learn to bide your time.

76
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,280
I went to see you at the camp.
They said you fell ill with a fever?

77
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
Yes, My Lord.

78
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
Greetings, My Lord.

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,039
Yes.

80
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,280
I was only reaching for tea.

81
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,640
Have it.

82
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,800
Is there any problem?

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,720
Young spouses

84
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
often behave this way
in their first years.

85
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,160
You must not
be familiar with this life yet.

86
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,920
Thank you.

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,880
You have my thanks, My Lord.

88
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
It is good that you are here.

89
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,920
I respectfully request your permission
for two days off duty.

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Are you still so very ill?

91
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,320
No, My Lord. I am feeling better.

92
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,560
I wish to travel to the mountain

93
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,280
to seek one of my masters.

94
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
You are to return to your school?

95
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
But had your headmaster not passed away?

96
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Headmaster

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,400
had one prime disciple.

98
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,200
I must go and find out

99
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
if this master still resides there.

100
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,880
Are you to invite the master
to help with our cause?

101
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,600
The present circumstances
are dire, My Lord.

102
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
The insurrection
and Prai's treachery both imminent.

103
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,520
I also have a feeling

104
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
that Taen Seenil's shadow
is still cast upon Ayothaya.

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,040
This is indeed
an unfortunate era for Ayothaya.

106
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
My magic

107
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,280
cannot even compare
to that of Taen Seenil.

108
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,760
That is why I need this master's help.

109
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,240
Lady Va! What?!

110
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,720
Did you follow me?

111
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,040
Did you intend to kill me?

112
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,080
Are you hurt? Let me see.

113
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,320
I am fine.

114
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,440
You…

115
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,600
Such suspicious actions
will lead to a swift end.

116
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,680
You are not fully recovered.

117
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,400
If you go into the woods alone

118
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,240
and disappear just like Noi,
what am I supposed to do?

119
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,840
Are you worried about my wellbeing?

120
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,640
I do not wish to concern myself with you.

121
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,560
Honestly,

122
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,880
I have absolutely no wish
to see you right now.

123
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,000
With such an unpredictable temper,
no one shall desire your company.

124
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
Lead the way.

125
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Do what you must.
I shall follow you from afar.

126
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,520
I am only here to make sure
you do not collapse and die.

127
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
That is all.

128
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
Is this the place

129
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,800
where you were trained in your arts?

130
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,000
The headmaster
has passed away many years ago.

131
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
So, there is no longer training here.

132
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
The disciples contact each other
by writing down the notes.

133
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,800
They would stop by and read the messages.

134
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,440
Is the master you seek
no longer here as well?

135
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
Perhaps not.
She has cut ties to this earthly realm.

136
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
She meddles with humans no more.

137
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,520
Though a message be left,
her response is not assured.

138
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,640
THE PAIN RUNS DEEP, FROM SKY TO SEA

139
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,760
MY HEART IN DEEP DESPAIR FOR THEE

140
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
NO GREED, NO LOVE, NO LUST I CRAVE

141
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
A LIFE OF CHASTITY I SHALL HAVE

142
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,200
NO LOVE, NO STRENGTH

143
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
<i>The pain runs deep, from sky to sea</i>

144
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,160
<i>My heart in deep despair for thee</i>

145
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,520
<i>No greed, no love</i>

146
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,760
<i>No lust I crave</i>

147
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,480
<i>A life of chastity I shall have</i>

148
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,720
This is what your school forbids.

149
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,240
It prevents you from marrying anyone

150
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,120
or loving anyone.

151
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
If you defy, what would happen?

152
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
"No love,

153
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,200
no strength."

154
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,840
What?

155
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,920
Do all women believe such a statement?

156
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,720
No. Well…

157
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,200
I only read it from this board.

158
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
NO LOVE, NO STRENGTH

159
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,520
Where did this board come from?

160
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,680
There is one there as well.

161
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,600
WHERE LOVE TAKES ROOT, WISDOM WITHERS

162
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,839
"Where love takes root, wisdom withers."

163
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,640
"Where love takes root,
miracles shall blossom."

164
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,880
Who could possibly write these texts?

165
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,960
Are they the disciples?
Why the decision to defy their master?

166
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,240
Good, then bad.

167
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,720
Joy, then sorrow.

168
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,440
The only cause of such torment is love.

169
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
GOOD, THEN BAD

170
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
JOY, THEN SORROW

171
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,480
THE ONLY CAUSE OF SUCH TORMENT IS LOVE

172
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,880
Your school
is full of strange rules, is it not?

173
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,680
Who would be able to follow them?
It is unnatural.

174
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,080
The magic I have learned

175
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,800
is unnatural by itself.

176
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,080
Sir.

177
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,080
I happen to be more fond of that text.

178
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,120
There.

179
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,880
"A life devoid of love
is a life of nullity."

180
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,280
What allows life to continue

181
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
is air and food. That is all.

182
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,840
Air and food. True. You're right.

183
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,080
Air and food sustain your body.

184
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,720
What of your heart?

185
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,320
Your heart and soul
stay alive because of love.

186
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,360
The love for your duty or the place.

187
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,560
The love for your parents, your friends,

188
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,480
your siblings.

189
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,520
The love…

190
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
for the one we love.

191
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,880
Who is that?

192
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,400
- Please stop!
- Sir!

193
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,000
Sir.

194
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,880
Sir.

195
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,240
Master.

196
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,320
- Sir!
- Master!

197
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,760
Sir.

198
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,920
Master!

199
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,320
Who are you looking for?

200
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
Master!

201
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,600
Please come out and help me!

202
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
I am truly in need of your assistance!

203
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Our nation faces a grave threat.

204
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,480
You are of the ascetic!

205
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
Will you permit the loss of life?

206
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,800
Master.

207
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,520
I beg you!

208
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,720
Please show yourself.

209
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,840
It is time, Master!

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
Please help me.

211
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,320
Please help the people.

212
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,160
What has happened to you?

213
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,040
It was the night that you…

214
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,600
You are a monster!

215
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,200
You are the devil!

216
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,120
What are you doing?

217
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,520
It hurts. Please let me go. Let go!

218
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Being far from you is painful!

219
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,680
Being near you is also painful.

220
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,360
But if I am this close to you,
how would it feel? Huh?!

221
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Sir! Sir!

222
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,760
It was me?

223
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
What I most despise

224
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,560
is men who force themselves upon women.

225
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,240
I grew up seeing my brother
do it to every female servant.

226
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,040
Seeing anything like this

227
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,040
makes me feel hurt

228
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,360
and tormented.

229
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,720
Little did I know that I would
one day be the victim myself.

230
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
This is the ointment from our school.

231
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,160
It shall cure your bruises.

232
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
I am all right now.

233
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
Let me apply it.

234
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,560
I am sorry.

235
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,880
I am truly sorry, dear.

236
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,080
Dear?

237
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,880
Did you say dear?

238
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,120
It is the very first time.

239
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,360
Buddha protects.

240
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Dharma cures.

241
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
Please ease her pain.

242
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,640
Please mend her wound.

243
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,560
My heart is filled
with the deepest remorse.

244
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,920
From this day forward, I swear

245
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,880
that I shall never again
be violent towards you.

246
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,440
I shall pamper my dear lady

247
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,800
with gentleness

248
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,440
until the day I die.

249
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,880
Physical intimacy
does not always mean love.

250
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,960
Instead, acts of gentleness

251
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,440
and care for our bodies and minds

252
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,880
are the signs of true love.

253
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,920
You can swim in this water.

254
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,480
Do you wish to soak in it?

255
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,920
Really?

256
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,560
Do we still have time?

257
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
It is fine.

258
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,680
The water is running down from
the mineral source on the mountain top.

259
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,440
It is beneficial,
and it can help calm your body.

260
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,960
Then…

261
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,920
So, I shall…

262
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,680
So, I will…

263
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,720
…wait on that side.

264
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,760
Yes.

265
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,720
Dear. Do you still have any symptoms?

266
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,080
Should you take some medicine?

267
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,240
No need.

268
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Tonight,

269
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,960
I will spend the night at the camp.

270
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,520
Yes.

271
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,680
You cannot be in the same house as me

272
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
because it is what your master told you.

273
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,320
I understand.

274
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,080
I will try not to get too close, dear.

275
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,760
This way. Enter the house.

276
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,040
Master is available now.

277
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
I have waited for so long.

278
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,920
Thank you.

279
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,320
Thank you.

280
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,240
Master Saenkam.

281
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,160
Proceed to the house.
Master is available now.

282
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,040
Thank you.

283
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,920
- What of me?
- Father, please wait a little more.

284
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
- Please allow me inside.
- What of us?

285
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,520
Father!

286
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,800
- Have our pomelo!
- Please let us in!

287
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,360
- We have a gourd.
- Look what we have.

288
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
Well, what is it that you have
for Master Saenkam?

289
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,880
- Would you have our peas?
- Sir.

290
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,720
Peas?!

291
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,200
- Please help my child.
- Peas?!

292
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,240
- I have bananas.
- Have our fruits.

293
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,200
Rice?!

294
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,160
Father.

295
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,320
Bananas?!

296
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,200
Cha, please help me.

297
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,720
My father has been cursed.

298
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,040
Please ask Master Saenkam to lift it.

299
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
What do you have to offer Master Saengkam?

300
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
Herbs, sir.

301
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,560
We do not need them. Go back to the line!

302
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,040
Please help me!

303
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Here, sir.

304
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,760
I am giving you all I have.

305
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,880
Please let me see the master, sir.

306
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
- Go. Proceed to the house.
- Yes.

307
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
- What of us?!
- Sir!

308
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
- Please help us too!
- Please.

309
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,720
- I beg you!
- Please help me, Cha!

310
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,680
- Please listen to us.
- Sir.

311
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
- Please help my father!
- Please!

312
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,440
- We do not need those peas! No!
- Please, sir.

313
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,360
- We do not need peas or chilis!
- Please.

314
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,480
These are the enchanted

315
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,560
magical plants.

316
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,720
They were enchanted by Master Saenkam.

317
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,320
- Oh, it is him.
- Master,

318
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,440
please make me wealthy.

319
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,840
Master.

320
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,360
Master!

321
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,520
What?!

322
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
Give me.

323
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,720
- Oh, sathu.
- Sathu.

324
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,880
- Sathu.
- Well, well.

325
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,360
Please grant me wealth.
Your magic is powerful.

326
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,240
Cha, brew the tea for that child.

327
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Yes.

328
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,240
Drink it if you wish to be cured.

329
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,480
Yes.

330
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,800
Help yourself up. Come.

331
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,080
Sip it.

332
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,600
- Well,
- How is it?

333
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,240
how are you feeling?

334
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,760
It seems his strength has returned.

335
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,880
He is doing much better.

336
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,000
If you wish for your son
to be fully cured,

337
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,880
you must have this plant.

338
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,840
But it is fairly expensive.

339
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,400
I must have it, regardless of the cost,

340
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,600
if it can rid my son
of his illness, Master.

341
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,760
Very well.

342
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
Then go downstairs.

343
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Cha, go teach them how to conjure it.

344
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,320
Yes, Master.

345
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,040
Now, what is it that you want?

346
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,520
- Me?
- Come forward.

347
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,520
- Well?
- It truly works.

348
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,120
My wife has been missing
for ten days, Master.

349
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,840
Where could she possibly go?

350
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,720
Have you two fought about anything?

351
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,040
Nothing, Master.

352
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,960
I beg you to search your mind

353
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,280
and see what fate
my wife is going through now.

354
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,400
What?

355
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,680
She is long dead.

356
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,720
Her throat was slit.

357
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,360
I shall find the culprit for you.

358
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,920
Master Saenkam! Stop!

359
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,440
Are you Muen Vorachai's servent?!

360
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,360
- Yes, sir.
- What is your name?!

361
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,680
My name is Jerm, sir.

362
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,800
This place does not welcome you!
Leave at once!

363
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
But I have given the money.

364
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,800
Cha!

365
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,320
Yes, My Lord. My Lord.

366
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,440
Return his money.

367
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,640
And do not ever let him
come to this place again!

368
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,680
Here!

369
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,120
Leave, and never return!

370
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,280
Did you not know

371
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,400
that man is the servant
under Muen Vorachai

372
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,320
and the husband of the pregnant woman
who has been killed

373
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
for the blood offerings
to conjure the amoria bloom?

374
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
He is but a servant. Why must I know?

375
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,639
But you were mentally
searching for her killer!

376
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,920
We were not the ones who committed it,

377
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,080
but it could be connected to us.

378
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,679
You are such a fool.

379
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,880
All right. I know.

380
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I shall be more careful from now.

381
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,840
You do nothing but drink all day.

382
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,239
To truly master sorcery,

383
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,360
one must refrain from drinking
and entangling with women.

384
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,040
Yet you partake in both!

385
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,000
Blast it!

386
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,320
I am carrying out
an important work for you!

387
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,800
And is it successful yet?!

388
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,240
Listen to me.

389
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,760
Pansaeng is now able
to return to his duty at the camp.

390
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,200
He is in no pain at all!

391
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,520
I have told you to wait!

392
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,320
- Everything I did was for your sake!
- How was it for my sake?!

393
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,120
I have only been losing.

394
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,680
I have paid for all your liquor and food!
And I have achieved nothing!

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
To start an insurrection,

396
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,720
you must have your own army!
And those people

397
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
are your army!

398
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,760
Army?

399
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
Continue.

400
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,560
To be born human

401
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,880
is to know hardships.

402
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,560
There are four kinds of hardships.

403
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,600
Is there anyone asking for wealth
and career advancement

404
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,000
among this crowd?

405
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,120
- Me!
- Me!

406
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,280
Me!

407
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,640
- Sathu!
- Sathu!

408
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,920
- Sathu!
- Sathu!

409
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,800
Approach.

410
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,840
- Go, go.
- Proceed.

411
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,240
- Do not keep him waiting.
- Come.

412
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,800
Go closer.

413
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,160
- Sathu!
- Sathu!

414
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,440
All shall worship Master Saenkam.

415
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,840
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

416
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,280
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

417
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,680
Anyone wishes to recover from illness?

418
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,960
My father, Master.

419
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,760
He is up!

420
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,400
All shall worship Master Saenkam,

421
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,840
and you will have

422
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,560
everything you desire. Everything.

423
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,640
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

424
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,680
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

425
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,160
Jerm went to see a shaman,

426
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,400
and he said that Noi died
after her throat was slit.

427
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,040
He could not eat or sleep
since he returned. He only kept crying.

428
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,480
I most pity him, My Lady.

429
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,120
Noi! Noi!

430
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
Noi! Where are you going?!

431
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,640
Without Noi and without our child,

432
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,200
I do not see any reason to live.

433
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,280
Jerm. Have some food.

434
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Without love, he no longer
has any strength, does he?

435
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,240
The day Noi disappeared,

436
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,120
<i>I found something at the dock.</i>

437
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
<i>It looked like Noi was in a hurry</i>

438
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,240
<i>and did not have a chance</i>
<i>to pick up her belongings.</i>

439
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,040
It must be so sudden
that she could not tell anyone.

440
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,240
Noi has a very old grandmather
who lives in Ban Khoktum.

441
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,360
There might be some unfortunate news
about her, and Noi's presence was needed.

442
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,440
Perhaps we should visit Noi's grandmother
to see if Noi is there with her.

443
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,840
Yes, My Lady.

444
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,040
That is why Aon and I shall need
to borrow a boat from Khun Saengplarn

445
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,360
to go find Noi in Ban Khoktum.

446
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,240
Let me go with you, Saiyud.

447
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,920
I am truly worried about Jerm.

448
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,160
Va is seeking my permission
to leave town by boat?

449
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
Who else is traveling?

450
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,000
There will be Aon,
Saiyud, and Lady Va, sir.

451
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Be careful, My Lady.

452
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Yes.

453
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,560
I am all right, Aon.

454
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
- Saiyud, be careful.
- Yes.

455
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,000
Saiyud.

456
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
- What?!
- Whoa!

457
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
Does the house spirit follow you, My Lady?

458
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,400
Saiyud! Do not scare me.

459
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,640
It was nothing.

460
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,720
Aon. Let us go now.

461
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,920
Phuan, we are ready to leave.

462
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,960
Yes.

463
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,360
Noi? She has not come here for months.

464
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,600
Did anything happen to her?

465
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,440
Is Grandmother Klam doing well?

466
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,880
Everyone in this house is well.

467
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,000
Well, what has happened?

468
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,000
Please tell us, My Lady.

469
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,000
Noi has been missing for two weeks.

470
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,600
We could not find her anywhere,

471
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,840
so we decided to come here
to find out if she is visiting all of you.

472
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,160
Noi is missing?

473
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,200
Noi, my little sister.

474
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,400
Jerm was heartbroken,
and the fever kept him from coming.

475
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,440
He refused to eat or sleep.
I am afraid we would lose him as well.

476
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,520
Noi…

477
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,200
Noi…

478
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,840
Noi…

479
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,640
Let us do as planned, Nim.

480
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,600
Yes.

481
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,120
Mother, wait for us here.

482
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,880
Brothers, sisters,

483
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
we shall go to the neighboring village.

484
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,400
Come.

485
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,080
Let us go look for Noi.

486
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,000
Her family agreed
to go ask all the households

487
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,960
if anyone is sick or has died,

488
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,520
in case Noi has run
into some trouble on the way.

489
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,880
But other than this house,
Noi had nowhere to go.

490
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,040
Yes, My Lady.
We have been looking everywhere.

491
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,640
We may need to spend the night here

492
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,040
to wait for any words.

493
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Yes.

494
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,880
Aon.

495
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,520
Their village
has a raft house on that side.

496
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,080
I have taken a look, and it is good enough
for us to spend the night in.

497
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,760
If it is only for a night or two,
I am fine with it.

498
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,520
What is it you are doing, My Lady?

499
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,760
I am boiling water for tea.

500
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,880
Do you want any--

501
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,760
My Lady!

502
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,600
- Was it a splinter?
- Perhaps.

503
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,040
Does it hurt?

504
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,160
Aon! Aon. What was that?

505
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,000
I do not know, My Lady.

506
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,320
It felt like I was…

507
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,840
I shall boil the water for you, My Lady.

508
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,160
Fine.

509
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,040
Be careful, Aon. Let me help.

510
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,320
Yes.

511
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,240
Dear?!

512
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,600
How could you splash it in such manner?!

513
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,240
Darn it!

514
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,400
It smells awful! Is that tea spoiled?!

515
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,120
Sir, why are you here?

516
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,440
Dear.

517
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,240
Did you sneak onto the boat with us?

518
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,920
Did you use some kind of magic
to conceal yourself, sir?

519
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,760
So, you were the one
who kicked me as well?

520
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,600
Did you follow us here

521
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,640
because you are jealous
of me and Aon again?

522
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,400
Sir,

523
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,400
you really are jealous.

524
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,240
Please forgive me

525
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,080
for the upset I have caused you.

526
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,560
You have saved my life many times.

527
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,760
I would never dare
to take anything that is yours.

528
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,560
I have never overstepped with her at all.

529
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,520
I truly have not, sir!

530
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,560
Dear. I have explained it all to you,

531
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,760
but you did not believe me,
and followed me here!

532
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,960
I swear

533
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,480
I would never betray you, Khun Saengplarn.

534
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,080
You…

535
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,200
You never trusted me.
You even forbade me from seeing Aon.

536
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,720
I am asking you honestly.

537
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,080
I need to sell the goods with Aon,
then how can we not meet at all?!

538
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,480
You must not see him, no matter what!

539
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,400
Then why do you not ask this man?

540
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,920
You have never overstepped physically,

541
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,400
but you have overstepped mentally!

542
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,200
Are you secretly fond of Lady Chavala?

543
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,040
Dear, you are speaking
nothing but nonsense.

544
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,040
Yes, sir.

545
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,360
Aon?

546
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,240
My Lady. My apologies.

547
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,400
Mentally overstepping shall one day
become physically overstepping.

548
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,600
I was right to come and watch you.

549
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,800
That was not necessary.

550
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,880
Dear, we are humans

551
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,120
who can suppress our feelings.

552
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,240
You are looking down on us too much now.

553
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,760
Lady Va.

554
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,400
Do you truly bear no affection for Aon?

555
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,720
Then why,

556
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,560
whenever you're around him,

557
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,360
you look truly joyful
and always laugh with him?

558
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,400
Laugh?

559
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,800
You have never laughed
when you are around me.

560
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
Have I never?

561
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,640
Dear…

562
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,600
Sir.

563
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,600
This is Saiyud.

564
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,960
She is my lover.

565
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,800
Wait, Aon. Lover?

566
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,080
Since when?

567
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,120
We have been for a while.

568
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,880
Sir, I beg you to stop doubting me.

569
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,800
I already have my lover.

570
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,160
Is that correct, Saiyud?

571
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,040
Yes, sir.

572
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,280
Please do not be suspicious
of Lady Va and Aon anymore.

573
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,040
My Lady.

574
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,720
Please forgive me.

575
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,160
Upon reflection, my feelings for you

576
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,880
are purely admiration.

577
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,880
You have always been merciful to me.

578
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,560
Please let me continue to serve you.

579
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,200
Please, My Lady.

580
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,360
Fine.

581
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,320
I see you as a brother,

582
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,600
all along and forever.

583
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,320
How did you two fall in love?

584
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,640
Are you not Muen Vorachai's woman?

585
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,720
Do not try to fool me.

586
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,720
I can see through you.

587
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,080
My body is held as a servant,
serving as the master's woman,

588
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,800
but my heart is free to love anybody.

589
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,240
I love Aon…

590
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,240
sir.

591
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,880
Whatever!

592
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,680
Such a thing
cannot be proved only by words.

593
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,000
I do not believe you.

594
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,920
He did not believe us.
What shall we do, Aon?

595
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,120
We may need some time.

596
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,120
It is fine. We were sincere
and spoke nothing but truth.

597
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,080
What truth?

598
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,720
The first time I earned money,

599
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
I planned to buy Lady Va something

600
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,280
since she helped me
escape from Muen Vorachai.

601
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,000
But when I was at the stall,

602
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,000
it was you who I thought of.

603
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,440
This one suits Lady Va.

604
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,040
And this will look good on Saiyud.

605
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,920
I shall have this one.

606
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,400
That night,

607
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
I spent all night thinking

608
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,080
that if I could only have one life,

609
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,600
who should I live for?

610
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,520
I have been struggling
with this problem for years.

611
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,360
What is the problem?

612
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,320
I have been thinking about
two women back and forth.

613
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,760
I did not know which one I love.

614
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,960
Hold on.

615
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,720
What you told Khun Saengplarn
was not a ploy?

616
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
It was not.

617
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,600
To be honest, I wanted
to tell you, but I was too afraid.

618
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,680
I saw a chance today…

619
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,120
Saiyud.

620
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,800
I love you.

621
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,280
How could you love me? I am flawed.

622
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,920
You're just as swept away
by passion as other young men are.

623
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,840
Do not think too much.
You shall forget in no time.

624
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,120
Saiyud. Saiyud!

625
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,560
Saiyud.

626
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,560
Saiyud.

627
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,480
I am not swept away.
I have thought about it thoroughly.

628
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,040
I truly love you,
and have for a long time.

629
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,120
But I am Muen Vorachai's woman.

630
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,800
There are plenty of young and pretty
girls. Why are you not interested?

631
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,360
But I have never
felt this with other girls.

632
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,800
You have said it yourself.

633
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,200
Our bodies can be held as a servent,
but our hearts are free.

634
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,600
If you must serve
Muen Vorachai, then do it.

635
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,920
I shall love you the same.

636
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,600
Aon.

637
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,440
I only wish to know

638
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,120
if you would accept me.

639
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,440
When you said that you love me,

640
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,240
I did not know if it was true,
but my heart was thumping,

641
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,800
like it was going to jump out of my chest.

642
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
What does your nod mean?

643
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,920
Yes.

644
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,280
I love you, Aon.

645
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,560
Does this mean you accepted me?

646
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,040
I am over the moon, Saiyud.

647
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,760
This feels like a dream.
How could it be true?

648
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,280
Yes.

649
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,880
It truly feels like a dream.

650
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,040
I have never thought
you would have the same dream.

651
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,760
Sir. Leave me.
I do not wish to talk to you.

652
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,440
If you did no wrong,
why do you not wish to talk to me?

653
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,520
Are you truly the Khun Saengplarn I know?

654
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,760
I will not talk to you.

655
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,200
- We shall talk.
- No.

656
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,880
- Let us talk first!
- I will not.

657
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,400
Wait. Ouch!

658
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,760
You…

659
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,320
- Talk to me.
- I will not.

660
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,680
Why must you keep following me?

661
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,960
You madman!

662
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,800
Is it not too harsh?

663
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,240
Are you calling me a madman?

664
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,320
Sir.

665
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,520
You were supposed to obey your master

666
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,120
by staying away from women,

667
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,640
so I left you alone.
But once I left you alone,

668
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,280
you decided to be jealous of me and Aon.

669
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,960
Could you please tell me what I must do?

670
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,400
I do not know if I should
be near you or far from you!

671
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,760
Being near or far means the same!

672
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,000
You always intrude upon my mind anyway!

673
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,160
What are you going to do to me?

674
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,880
There's one feeling

675
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,840
I've had for you

676
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,760
that I've never had

677
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,920
for Lady Va.

678
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,800
Aon! Are you not too young to do this?

679
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,920
You have been seeing me since childhood,

680
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
but I am all grown up now.

681
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,720
I have longed to do this with you.

682
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,200
Please do not mind me.

683
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,200
Yes.

684
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,480
Where are you going?!

685
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,240
They are right outside.
How are you supposed to get out?!

686
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,000
I love you. I cannot stop.

687
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,640
Lady Va must be looking for me now.

688
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,040
Not likely.

689
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,280
Perhaps she is with Khun Saengplarn now.

690
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,160
I shall take a walk.

691
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,480
Do not follow me.

692
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,640
If the spirit of Noi remains unbound,

693
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,680
we ask that you appear before us.

694
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,040
Let the unknown be known.

695
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,040
Let the concealed be brought to light.

696
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,160
Noi!

697
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,280
I wish for a love charm.

698
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,720
Might I suggest the magical plant?

699
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,560
Boil these leaves
and give that tea to your intended

700
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,080
to drink for only a few days.

701
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,840
He shall think of nothing but you.

702
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,400
It is best to sacrifice
with the blood of a pregnant woman.

703
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,000
The magic shall be most effective.

704
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,960
Fate is indeed cruel.

705
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,560
<i>People are held as servants.</i>

706
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,440
<i>Our bodies may be confined for any reason,</i>

707
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,960
yet our hearts shall always be free.

708
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,200
We can hold anyone in our hearts.

709
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
