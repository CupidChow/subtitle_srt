1
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,200
Pansaeng is surely facing illness
from amoria bloom.

2
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
He shall die without our effort.

3
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
How long shall it be?

4
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,680
Master! Please come out and help me!

5
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,880
Perhaps we should visit Noi's grandmother.

6
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Does the house spirit follow you, My Lady?

7
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,480
Saiyud! Do not scare me.

8
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,840
Aon. What was that?

9
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
I do not know, My Lady.

10
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,680
- Hey!
- Sir, why are you here?

11
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,720
Did you secretly board the boat with us?

12
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
I would never betray you, Khun Saengplarn.

13
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,840
I shall take a walk.

14
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,640
Do not follow me.

15
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
Sir.

16
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Your breakfast, sir.
Do you wish to have it now?

17
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Yes. Thank you.

18
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,640
Sir.

19
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
About me and Saiyud…

20
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,400
If you do not believe me,

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,000
- I--
- Oh, no, no.

22
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,080
- I believe you.
- You do, sir?

23
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,000
I do, completely.

24
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,160
You have found one, have you not?

25
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,960
The gentle soul who cares
for both your body and mind.

26
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,640
Yes, My Lady.

27
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,240
I have witnessed the pain
you went through while serving Chai.

28
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,440
Now, I am relieved.

29
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,000
Someone as kind as you
shall have Aon to depend on.

30
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,480
I am most rejoiced.

31
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,000
We are still in trouble, My Lady.

32
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
I beg you and Khun Saengplarn
to keep this a secret.

33
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
If Muen Vorachai knows,
he will surely kill Aon.

34
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,760
Does that mean the two of you
must be together in secret?

35
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,840
We shall love each other
for the sake of love. That is enough.

36
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Our lives together

37
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,600
are in the hands of destiny.

38
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
Did Aon give it to you?

39
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
Yes.

40
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
Can I see?

41
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,280
Is it pretty, My Lady?

42
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,720
You could not stop touching it.

43
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,480
I shall report this to Khun Saengplarn.

44
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes.

45
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
Shall we go?

46
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,840
The family went around
asking in all the villages

47
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,160
from Ayothaya to Ban Khoktum,
and nobody had gotten sick or died lately.

48
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,160
So, we have not found Noi?

49
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,200
Khun Saengplarn, sir.

50
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,360
With your magic, could you please help us?

51
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
What do you wish for me to help with?

52
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,280
It has been ten days. Noi

53
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,640
must have been dead.

54
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,600
We have accepted it,

55
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,680
but we wish to find her body
and make merit for her

56
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,120
to send her to the peaceful realm.

57
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,680
Did Muen Vorachai not send soldiers
from Ayothaya to look for her?

58
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,880
We are not asking for soldiers, sir.

59
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,440
We’re asking for your help
to call Noi’s spirit and ask

60
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,640
how she died and where her body is.

61
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,760
Call Noi's spirit? That is it.

62
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,320
The power of your magic is immense.
Please help us.

63
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Dear. Could you actually do it?

64
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
The spell for calling spirits does exist,

65
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,720
yet my school strictly forbids it.
It's considered a sin.

66
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,400
The dead are travelling to the next realm.
Calling them to us may confuse them

67
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,200
and cause them to be stuck
in this realm, unable to move on.

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Noi.

69
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,560
- Noi.
- Dear.

70
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
Fine.

71
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
We shall try once.

72
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,240
Let’s simply focus
all our thoughts and love on Noi.

73
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,720
If her spirit is still roaming
and has enough strength to come to us,

74
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,320
we shall know the truth.

75
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,600
You have my thanks, sir.
We are deeply grateful.

76
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
Repeat my words.

77
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,720
May Buddha aid us.

78
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
- May Buddha aid us.
- May Buddha aid us.

79
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,920
- May Dharma aid us.
- May Dharma aid us.

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
- May Sangha aid us.
- May Sangha aid us.

81
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,800
If the spirit of Noi remains unbound,

82
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,560
we ask that you appear before us

83
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,560
to guide us. Let the unseen

84
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,720
be seen.

85
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,920
Let the unknown be known.
Let the concealed be brought to light.

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,440
- Is she truly here?
- It is fine.

87
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,000
Noi. Noi. Where are you?

88
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,520
Do not leave me by myself.

89
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,480
Where are you going, Noi?!

90
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
Noi.

91
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,520
Do not leave me.

92
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,880
I did not see or hear anything.

93
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
Noi.

94
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,560
Are you wandering around here, Noi?

95
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,880
Noi. Who did this to you?

96
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Come out and tell us.

97
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,560
It is possible
that her spirit has found rest.

98
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,600
The fact that she did not hold on
might also be a blessing.

99
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,560
During this time,

100
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,280
keep praying and making merit.

101
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Let the good deeds ease your sorrow.

102
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,360
That way, Noi shall have no worries.

103
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,600
My apologies, sir. Victory is mine!

104
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,720
- Darn it.
- Let us start again.

105
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,960
<i>Let the unseen be seen.</i>

106
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,160
<i>Let the unknown be known.</i>

107
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,760
<i>Let the concealed be brought to light!</i>

108
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,760
What is it, sir?

109
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
<i>As you served me in life,</i>

110
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,400
<i>so shall you serve me in death!</i>
<i>I am not afraid of you!</i>

111
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
Noi! Noi!

112
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,360
Noi!

113
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
Get off me… Noi!

114
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,720
This young lady was born
with tremendous potential.

115
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,400
When she was born, did you dream anything
unusual or experience anything strange?

116
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
We did. Her father was promoted then.

117
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,160
I have met with many fortune tellers.
Every single one of them stated

118
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,000
that this child would bring
prosperity to her parents.

119
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,920
Might you be interested
in an empowerment ritual with me?

120
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,800
Spend a few nights here
to pray and receive blessings.

121
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,840
Certainly, Master. She will.

122
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,040
What shall happen after the ritual?

123
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,600
She shall bring even more wealth
and honor to your family.

124
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
Look, My Lady. This place is crowded.

125
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,840
As of late, people inside and outside
the palace are speaking of nothing

126
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,600
but the magical power of Master Saenkam.

127
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,600
How could an ordinary tree
turn into a magical tree?

128
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,120
But many have confirmed
its potency, My Lady.

129
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,440
All of them had their wishes granted.
Please give it a try.

130
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,120
It shall help with Khun Saengplarn.

131
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,920
The two of you, how may I be of service?

132
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,560
My Lady,

133
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,880
you were born
with strong spiritual power and merit.

134
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,880
Do you wish to commence
an empowerment ritual with me?

135
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,400
You only need to pray
with me for two nights.

136
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,400
Perhaps not. I only wish for a love charm.

137
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
You have someone you desire.

138
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,640
What is the name of that nobleman
or wealthy merchant?

139
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
- Can I keep it to myself?
- For someone such as you,

140
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,320
might I suggest the magical plant?

141
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Normally, Master would give only
the leaves. But for a special lady,

142
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,880
he shall give the entire plant
for you to worship.

143
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,160
But it requires a sacrifice.

144
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,119
- Is that blood?
- Chicken's blood.

145
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,240
Boil these leaves and give that tea
to your intended to drink for a few days.

146
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,319
He shall think of nothing

147
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,359
but you and could not even eat or sleep.

148
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,640
It is best to sacrifice
with the blood of a pregnant woman.

149
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,360
The magic shall be most effective,
and he shall madly

150
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
beg to be with you.

151
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,120
This is madness.
Who would kill a person for this?

152
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
Even if a servant's life were sacrificed,

153
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,840
none would dare hold the daughter
of a noble such as yourself accountable.

154
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,800
Many have their wish granted.

155
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,600
You can ask around
if you do not believe me.

156
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
Is that not Muen Vorachai? Why is he here?

157
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,360
The spirit of Noi haunted you?
Did she appear before you?!

158
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,760
No, Master. But I have been

159
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,920
dreaming about being suffocated
by her for many nights now!

160
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Then it is all in your head.
No need to be afraid!

161
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,920
But I have not slept for four nights.

162
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,280
Look at my face!
I can no longer take this, Master!

163
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,640
You think too much about a mere servant.
She is dead and should not concern you!

164
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,120
But she became a ghost!

165
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
Whatever. I must have amulets
to shield myself from her.

166
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,080
I cannot tolerate
this anymore, Master! Please!

167
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,880
Fine. I shall give you one.

168
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
You need not fear.

169
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,240
What is this area called?

170
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
Wat Heeplat cemetery, sir.

171
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,640
Are you truly not planning
to use this plant, My Lady?

172
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,520
Look at this, My Lord.

173
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,040
He does not even respect us.

174
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,000
My sister’s honor has been tarnished.

175
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,480
What are you talking about, brother?

176
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,680
How do you wish to hold him responsible?

177
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,720
He must hold a wedding ceremony

178
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,640
to restore my sister's honor, My Lord.

179
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,200
- Wedding?
- We cannot let that wedding happen.

180
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,680
That was a reasonable request.

181
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
Do not say that, my dear.

182
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
I have disrespected your honor,

183
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,080
all out of love for you.

184
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,040
Khun Saengplarn and Lady Chavala
were not said to be in love.

185
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
Only Muen Vorachai alone was trying
to force the marriage upon them.

186
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,160
What is it
you are thinking about, My Lady?

187
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,600
Pao. Send someone
to look in Muen Vorachai's house.

188
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,280
What is it we are looking for?

189
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
Find out if someone
has died in that house.

190
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,440
Noi must truly be dead, My Lady.

191
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,200
My life comes to an end.

192
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,360
Jerm. Do not do this.

193
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,720
You must have some food
and take your medicine. Please.

194
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,840
My Lady.

195
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
For seven years of marriage,
we have remained childless.

196
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,200
Then, we were able to have one.

197
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,680
I have stopped drinking since that day.

198
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,160
I intended to be a good father.

199
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,920
I could do it. For eight months,

200
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
I have not touched any liquor.

201
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
Where love takes root,

202
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,680
miracles blossom.

203
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes, My Lady.

204
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,160
I did not believe I could do it.

205
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,760
But then Noi had to die.

206
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Both the mother and the child are gone.

207
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
After this meal,
I shall return to the camp right away.

208
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,640
Very well.

209
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,920
What is it?

210
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,480
Hey!

211
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,240
Are you teasing me?

212
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,120
What? You said that you never
saw me laugh when I am around you.

213
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,560
So, I showed you.

214
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,040
What is wrong with you?
You were sad about Noi only a while ago.

215
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,680
Well,

216
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,080
I saw Aon splash a pot of tea towards you,
and I truly wanted to try as well.

217
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
Fine.

218
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,920
- It is my turn now.
- Dear.

219
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,200
Come here.

220
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
What is it you are doing?

221
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,840
What happened to Noi and Jerm showed me

222
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,960
how little time we truly have.

223
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,680
Hm.

224
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,200
Jerm could not eat or sleep.

225
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,320
He suffers because of love.

226
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,600
And that of Aon and Saiyud.

227
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,160
These two fare no better.

228
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,640
Love that has no hope of a future

229
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,560
shall be a lifelong agony for them.

230
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,200
They have made me realize

231
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,680
that fate is indeed cruel.

232
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,560
It can confine us
as servants of all kinds.

233
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
It confines you

234
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,880
as a good disciple who would
never betray your master's teachings.

235
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Our bodies may be confined for any reason,

236
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,040
yet our hearts shall always be free.

237
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,440
We can hold anyone in our hearts.

238
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Hold anyone in our hearts?

239
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,880
What are you trying to say?

240
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,200
We shall love

241
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,880
for the sake of love.

242
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,880
That is enough.

243
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120
Our lives together

244
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,400
are in the hands of destiny.

245
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,480
I should return to the camp.

246
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,920
Dear.

247
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,400
Could you wait for me?

248
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,000
Let us take some time
to enjoy these flowers together.

249
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,520
This is the only season of the year

250
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,720
when these trees are in full bloom.

251
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
It is like my dream.

252
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,000
If you only walk past them,

253
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,040
you will have missed your chance
when they have all fallen.

254
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,760
If you keep stopping for the flowers,
what of the goals in your life?

255
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,280
My goal is to avenge
my parents and my sister

256
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,520
and save those who are wronged.

257
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
I appreciate them for only a few minutes.

258
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,640
I do not wish to own them.

259
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,400
It does not take long to appreciate.

260
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,400
You did not study any magic.
Yet the fragrance of flowers

261
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,400
on the house and on yourself

262
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,240
is even more powerful than magic.

263
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,040
If flowers serve no purpose,

264
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,040
why would they exist in our world?

265
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,400
I have thought it through.

266
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,760
I shall hold you in my heart.

267
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,200
I love you,

268
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,560
not as a sibling.
And it is not merely an admiration.

269
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,920
No. You will be the one to suffer.

270
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,320
Do not do this.

271
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,520
You need not worry.

272
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,040
I shall help you

273
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,360
uphold the vow you took with your master.

274
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,040
I only wanted to tell you

275
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,400
and celebrate the freedom of my heart.

276
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,040
I wish to appreciate the flowers.

277
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,160
And I wish to appreciate
our lives together.

278
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,920
That is enough for me.

279
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
I should not have done it, Master.

280
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,720
I have brought an enemy into my life.

281
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,520
The worst enemy there is.

282
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,600
I shall not survive this time.

283
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,360
Please help me, Master.

284
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,920
Please help me.

285
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,440
I have a crime to report! My wife was
killed and her blood was used for a plant!

286
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,159
My wife was killed!
I am here to report a crime!

287
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,360
My wife was killed,
and her blood was used to water a plant!

288
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,000
- Go!
- Advance!

289
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,360
- Yours is doomed.
- That shall not be!

290
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,720
Go! Go!

291
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,840
It must look for the right time to strike.

292
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,240
- Go!
- Well done.

293
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,200
- That is it.
- Attack!

294
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
- Go. Go.
- Daeng, attack.

295
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,280
My Lords. My Lords.

296
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,720
- My Lords.
- Hey!

297
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,200
My Lords. I am here to report a crime.
Please do not dismiss me.

298
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
Who are you?! How did you get in here?!

299
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,040
Guards! Get him out!

300
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,800
I did not harm anyone.
I am only troubled. Please listen to me.

301
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,960
Go report your trouble to your governor!

302
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,040
The governor did not listen to me,
so was the capital court.

303
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,760
No one was able to help me, My Lords.

304
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
Please.

305
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,720
A citizen comes to report a crime,
and must he be hurt for it?

306
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
But it was against the law
to trespass the palace vicinity!

307
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,480
Did you not hear
that nobody listened to him?

308
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,520
We have a duty to help citizens
resolve their problems.

309
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,640
And this is a time for duty,
not entertainment.

310
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
You insolent bastard!

311
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,720
In the palace vicinity, we are unarmed.

312
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
Letting outsiders in is dangerous!

313
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,360
How shall we live without rules?!

314
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,880
My Lords. I beg you.

315
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,800
You can execute me,
but my wife deserves justice.

316
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,640
Well. State your problem.

317
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,320
My name is Chuang, a servant
at Luang Athikorn's house, My Lords.

318
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,200
My wife's name is Pin. I suspect that

319
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,640
Luang Athikorn killed my wife, My Lords.

320
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,160
You are accusing a nobleman of high rank.

321
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,920
No wonder everyone denies your report.

322
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,600
Luang Athikorn's only son
is gravely ill. Two weeks ago,

323
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,000
he received a magical plant
from Master Saenkam.

324
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,160
This plant requires a sacrifice of freshly
spilled blood from a pregnant woman.

325
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,400
Then, my three-month
pregnant wife disappeared.

326
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,760
She has been missing
for seven days now, My Lords.

327
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,040
Are you assuming
that your master killed your wife

328
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,040
to offer her blood to the plant?

329
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,360
Yes, My Lord.

330
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,280
Are there any eyewitnesses
or any evidence?

331
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,760
No, My Lord.

332
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,800
Luang Athikorn refused
to help me find my wife

333
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,760
and offered me 20 hun of gold.

334
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,480
If he was not responsible,
why must he give me the gold?

335
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,440
Did Luang Athikorn tell you

336
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,120
the reason he gave you the gold?

337
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,080
He said that
I did my duties well, My Lord.

338
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,960
A mere assumption cannot be
considered a criminal case.

339
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,920
Also, you have no witness or proof at all.

340
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,360
Are you not going to help me, My Lords?

341
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,720
At least you must have the body
for us to investigate further.

342
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,240
But the culprit is a Luang! He would not
leave the body for us to find, My Lord!

343
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,680
We are sorry
we could not take this accusation.

344
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,440
But you shall be punished
for trespassing the palace ground.

345
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,520
Put him in prison!

346
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,560
Guards! Take him away!

347
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,000
Come here.

348
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,000
I spoke the truth!
Luang Athikorn killed my wife!

349
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,720
- He killed my wife and child!
- Take him away!

350
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,400
- Let go! Let me go!
- Get him out of here!

351
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,760
The problem is solved, My Lords.

352
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,120
An artifact that requires blood offerings.
A savage cult such as this one

353
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
must be watched closely.

354
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,880
Yes, My Lord.

355
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,280
A simple archery shot

356
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,960
should not be this hard for a renowned
soldier such as Khun Saengplarn.

357
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,200
Dear.

358
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,960
Shall we go somewhere quiet
and talk about Master Saengkam?

359
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,640
A few days ago, someone reported

360
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,040
that a sacrifice
for Master Saenkam's magical plant

361
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,280
is blood from pregnant women.

362
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,480
But there is no evidence
of someone actually offering it.

363
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,320
But there is one pregnant servant missing.

364
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,080
No. Two of them.

365
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,440
One is from Luang Athikorn's house,
and another is from Muen Vorachai's.

366
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,080
It was Noi.

367
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,120
I see you have heard something.

368
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,640
Hm.

369
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,600
I am here to tell you
that I saw Muen Vorachai

370
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,840
at Master Saenkam's house as well.

371
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,480
May I ask what you were doing there?

372
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,480
I went to observe that place
on Father's behalf. Am I not allowed to?

373
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,240
You are.

374
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,520
Dear, please see if you are
experiencing anything strange.

375
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,520
Is your strength
or are your skills beginning to diminish?

376
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,760
How are they relevant?

377
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,320
Well, from the beginning, Muen Vorachai
forced you to marry his sister

378
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,320
to try to weaken your magical abilities.

379
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,960
If he truly asked Master Saenkam
to curse you with a love charm

380
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,760
using that servant's blood,
you shall become sick,

381
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,440
unfocused, and insane.
You shall lose all your skills.

382
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,480
Are you feeling any changes?

383
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
Traitor!

384
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,960
After all I have done for you!

385
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,440
Was it that pleasant
to spend the night together?!

386
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,840
Sir.

387
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Well, not that much.

388
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,400
But you feel something?

389
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,600
That is it. I always knew
Lady Chavala's intentions were not pure.

390
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,160
Well, I suggest you return
and look through your house carefully.

391
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,760
You shall find the magical plant.

392
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,760
If you find one, you must
drive Lady Chavala out of the house.

393
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,560
I do not wish for you to end up like Prai.

394
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,720
Ah.

395
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,800
What business has led you
all the way to this camp, Lady Pim?

396
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,960
This is a bedroom.
Perhaps I was sleeping here.

397
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,640
I am here to bring you your meal.

398
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,840
I happened to miss you.

399
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,320
How could a lady say such words?

400
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,600
I do not know.

401
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,160
I truly missed you.

402
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,720
I wanted to see your face.

403
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,520
Let me pour some tea for you.

404
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,160
<i>I sense no enchantment.</i>

405
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,920
What are you doing, dear?

406
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,320
I was only swatting flies.

407
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,960
Here.

408
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,920
Have plenty, dear.

409
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,160
I have missed your cooking so much.

410
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,280
Your chili paste is so…

411
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,240
Actually,

412
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,480
you did not have to walk me home.
I can return by myself.

413
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,520
I must fetch something anyway.

414
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,320
Very well.

415
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,160
Can I have a tiffin back?

416
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,560
Thank you, dear.

417
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,960
You found nothing?!

418
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,240
How could that be?

419
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,080
Or perhaps Khun Saengplarn's
weaker magic compared

420
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,160
to Master Saenkam's
prevents him from detecting it?

421
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,200
Hey.

422
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,280
My apologies, sir.

423
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,360
But Pao's words also make sense.

424
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,880
He may be using illusion magic.

425
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,000
You said yourself
that you feel somewhat unusual.

426
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,120
Unease from sickness is completely normal.

427
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,280
Let us say that
I have taken a look and found nothing.

428
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,560
I shall go train
the soldiers now, My Lady.

429
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,720
We must go see with our own eyes, Pao.

430
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,760
Yes, My Lady.

431
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,800
Pao, Aum.

432
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
- Yes, My Lady?
- Yes, My Lady?

433
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,960
Look through every plant. See if there are
leaves like this one. Search everywhere.

434
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,480
- Yes, My Lady.
- Yes, My Lady.

435
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,680
What is this?

436
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,320
What is it you are doing here, My Lady?

437
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,400
Lady Chavala, your brother

438
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,880
cast a love charm
on Khun Saengplarn with the magical plant.

439
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,480
And I am here to find proof.

440
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,880
Cast a love charm using a plant?

441
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,600
Yes. The magical plant
from Master Saenkam.

442
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,960
Well, there is no such thing here.

443
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,880
A love charm must be cast on two.

444
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,600
You may not realize yet.

445
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,920
Any strange feelings?

446
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,400
Agitated? Irritable?

447
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,640
Hm?

448
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,960
I did not find any, My Lady.

449
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,840
I found nothing as well.

450
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,720
Lady Pim. Lady Pim! Wait!

451
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,680
Nothing.

452
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,200
Lady Pim, stop at once!

453
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,200
Lady Pim! Listen to me.
Why must I cast a love charm on him

454
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,440
when I am already
his royal-bestowed wife, his only wife?

455
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,000
A wife he loathes
to the point of moving away to the camp?

456
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,320
Are you still calling yourself his wife?

457
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,360
It is nothing to be concerned about.

458
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,160
Regardless, you are not to come between us

459
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,480
for Khun Saengplarn is mine
and mine alone.

460
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,520
Only for now. I shall unveil

461
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,840
the conspiracy you hatched
with your brother to destroy him.

462
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,440
It is all because of you
that I couldn't eat or sleep for months.

463
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,680
You shall die today!

464
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,520
Lady Pim!

465
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,640
You are wrong to pick a fight
with a merchant like me!

466
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,640
- Stop!
- It hurts!

467
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,640
How could you destroy
other people's belongings?!

468
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,720
- Stop!
- It hurts!

469
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,240
What a mess! This is an all-out war, sir!

470
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,840
Stop! Stop at once!

471
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,200
Va, stop! All of you, stop!

472
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,120
Dear!

473
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
Why would you hug Lady Pim?!

474
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,560
Let go of her! Come here!

475
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,000
What is this, Lady Pim?
What is it you are doing here?!

476
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,520
I am here to save you.

477
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,040
To find a plant you could not find.

478
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,520
And have you found it?

479
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,640
With the three of you,
one plant should be easy enough to find!

480
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,320
Must you all fight?!

481
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,360
What?

482
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,080
And have you three found it?!

483
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,960
No, sir.

484
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,240
Hm.

485
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,600
A slander. Lady Pim accused me
because she wants my husband for herself!

486
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,360
She could not be any more straightforward.

487
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,640
Lady Pim. If you search
my house in this manner,

488
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,080
I could report you to the judge.

489
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,120
Are you under a spell?

490
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,040
Could you bring yourself to report me?

491
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,800
I am not under any spell, Lady Pim.

492
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,280
But if you do not leave
my house now, I shall really do it

493
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,040
The daughter of the Minister
of the Royal Household

494
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,480
was reported
by Khun Saengplarn for trespassing!

495
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,800
It shall be a scandalous case!

496
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,200
You are truly under a spell.
It is obvious.

497
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,640
What good does a woman like her have
that makes you so fond of her?

498
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,640
One day, I shall find a way to save you.

499
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,600
It is your time to go.

500
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,600
- You!
- Go away!

501
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,120
- Enough!
- Hey!

502
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,960
Go away. Take your things too.

503
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,600
Aum, enough!

504
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
- What a pain.
- What?

505
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,240
You too! Why did you not stop your lady?!

506
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,880
Well…

507
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,120
You were much calmer and did not
turn to violence like this before!

508
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,120
I was not protective
of you then, but I am now!

509
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,440
And how would it end
if you two kept fighting?

510
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,720
She accused me of using a love charm.
It was only her excuse to see you!

511
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,560
So, Lady Pim can go see you at the camp,

512
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,280
but I am not allowed
to work with Aon at the market.

513
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,800
Lady Pim and I have nothing going on.

514
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,400
Aon and I have nothing going on either!

515
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,280
If she can freely visit you, how can I be
sure she does not spend nights with you?

516
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,560
- What? Are you out of your mind?!
- Well?!

517
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,560
- There are soldiers at the camp!
- There are people at the market as well!

518
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,800
If you do not wish for me
to work or to see Aon,

519
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,800
you should spend nights at your house!

520
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,880
At least I’ll feel reassured
that you’re not with anyone at night.

521
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,120
Checkmate!

522
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,120
What was that, Ming?

523
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,320
I played chess
with Yong this morning, sir.

524
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,880
The Bishop checked the King,

525
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,480
and he had nowhere to go.

526
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,640
Shut up!

527
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,240
It does not matter.
Whether I sleep here or at the camp,

528
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,520
we shall not lie together anyway.

529
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,200
Dear!

530
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,680
I do not wish to lie with you, but my
honor was hurt. Lady Pim disrespected me!

531
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,480
Whatever, dear!

532
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,720
If you stay within my sight

533
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,600
and Lady Pim
sneaks in to see you at night,

534
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,960
at least the dogs will bark
and I will wake up to watch over you!

535
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,680
- No! I shall spend nights at the camp!
- What?!

536
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,280
Women are such a pain!

537
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,280
Both women and men
can be consumed by jealousy!

538
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,720
Well… Who was it that was
destroying things at the market?

539
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,080
- Hm?
- You!

540
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,360
I shall not talk to you anymore!

541
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,360
The King can still run away, Ming.

542
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,240
This game is far from over.
We must keep watching.

543
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,920
You constantly dictate others' actions,
yet you don't behave yourself.

544
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,800
- Tian.
- Yes, sir.

545
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,680
Laor is not here yet? I requested
a scented candle. Did she deliver it?

546
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
- She will not come.
- What?

547
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,200
Laor said that

548
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,520
from now,
I shall be the one cooking for you.

549
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,560
Why?!

550
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,280
Lady Va is angry with you.
That is all Laor told me.

551
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,520
Angry with me?

552
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,800
- Yes.
- Angry with me?

553
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,480
Why does the sound feel so close tonight?

554
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,680
All this time,

555
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,840
is it you who has been playing the fiddle?

556
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,400
You are worried
if I meet with someone at night,

557
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,920
so I am here to tell you

558
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,640
I have been coming
for someone at the dock nearby

559
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,600
to play the fiddle for her.

560
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,400
It is truly you.

561
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,960
Well, Tian has told me before,
but I did not believe him.

562
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,000
The house is on one side, yet you played
the fiddle on the other side of the river.

563
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,880
How strange.

564
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,120
The music from this fiddle

565
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,920
has made my nights not feel lonely at all.

566
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,680
Has this music helped
to calm your anger towards me?

567
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,120
Did it calm my anger?

568
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,160
Hey. Wait.

569
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,160
I did not wish for you to do this.

570
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,760
You are out of line now.

571
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,240
Always surprises me with strange acts.

572
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,160
Everything I did is only to assure you

573
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,880
as siblings only.

574
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,480
Siblings. It is all we shall be.

575
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,480
Very well, siblings.

576
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,280
Father, Mother, this is Pansaeng,

577
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,120
the one I am wedded to.

578
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,400
Help! Please help me!

579
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,320
It is our human nature to believe

580
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,640
that achievements come from
the sacred power, rather than ourselves.

581
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,400
Are you here to challenge me?

582
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,840
You have robbed my family!

583
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,240
Who are you?

584
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,880
My name is Khun Saengplarn!

585
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,600
Your obsession with a woman weakened you.

586
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,320
Your magic has faded now.

587
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,680
I wish to be reborn
to meet you in every life

588
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,120
and for us to always remember each other.

589
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,720
