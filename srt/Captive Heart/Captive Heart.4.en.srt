1
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,880
<i>All Master Prai's disciples, be prepared.</i>
<i>We shall hold the power of this nation.</i>

2
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Prai is a monster, not human anymore.

3
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
I am here!

4
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,200
Is it Luang Bovorntat
who is planning an insurrection?

5
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,880
Pansaeng was slashed by Prai's blade.
Take this opportunity.

6
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,160
‪I hate you!

7
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,240
He came to kill me,

8
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,000
and you saved him.

9
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,160
I shall come to this house

10
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,120
<i>and take care of you every day.</i>

11
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,080
I request your permission
to move back to my home, sir.

12
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,000
I shall reunite
with the servants in that house

13
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,640
and find a way
to start a new life somewhere.

14
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,640
From now on,

15
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,080
I want all of you
to sell the goods in the market

16
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,480
and make some money.

17
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Muen Vorachai would kill us.

18
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,040
He was even upset
with you for selling goods.

19
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,760
Do it in secret,
and do not let Chai know, Noi.

20
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,440
We must make money
to start our lives anew.

21
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
Are we running away, My Lady?

22
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,400
Saiyud, lower your voice.

23
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,280
We may need two months
to carry out this plan.

24
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,320
Money doesn't concern me.
But the place we shall go…

25
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,920
Aon. Can we move
to Mueang Khon, your hometown?

26
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,360
To my hometown?

27
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,480
Of course, My Lady.

28
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,880
It is a large city,
and I still have some relatives there.

29
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,480
We all shall survive there.

30
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
Good.

31
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,680
We shall flee to Aon's hometown.

32
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,080
You have my thanks.

33
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Yes, My Lady.

34
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
Tomorrow, I want you to search
for evidence at Muen Vorachai's house.

35
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,720
Find out if there are any connections
to Luang Bovorntat.

36
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,360
If I walk brazenly into his house,

37
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
I shall be struck down, sir.

38
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,400
Take this sacred item with you.

39
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
I lost again.

40
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,320
- I won.
- Come on.

41
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,240
Mueang Khon lies
a considerable distance from Ayothaya.

42
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,640
When we arrive,

43
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Lady Va shall become a person
without noble status, a normal citizen.

44
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,480
Va cares not for her status.

45
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,240
She would be happier as a normal citizen.

46
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,920
And I would not
have to be a slave anymore.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,960
You and I,

48
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,160
all of us, will be equal to Lady Va.

49
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,520
But Va never saw us as servants.

50
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,840
Muen Vorachai does no work all day, sir.

51
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,240
He wastes his time gambling
with people every day.

52
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,000
He gambles while drunk,
losing a great deal.

53
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
Imbecile.

54
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,560
Is he truly Lady Chavala's brother?

55
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
There were some documents,

56
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,720
yet I didn't know which one to take,
since I couldn't read very well.

57
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,720
It is fine.

58
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,040
There's another matter, sir.

59
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
Lady Chavala has made plans
with the servants

60
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,400
to move to Mueang Khon.
Are you aware of this, sir?

61
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,440
I am.

62
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
You all, put in some effort!

63
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,200
Did you talk to her about this?

64
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,120
Do you two really wish to separate?

65
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,559
I married her only to capture criminals.

66
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,080
I thought she was working with them.

67
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,720
But surprisingly,

68
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,480
these siblings are nothing alike.

69
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
It is no use

70
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
to keep her around.

71
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,800
- But the one who is taking Lady--
- Hey.

72
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
You.

73
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Hold your blade higher.

74
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,960
Watch me.

75
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,240
- Come.
- The one who is taking her to Mueang Khon

76
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
is the male servant who is close to her.
He has held her hands.

77
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
More importantly, he is quite charming.

78
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,560
Oh, no. Sir. Sir! Please calm down, sir.

79
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,200
He is still new.

80
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
He's new, sir.

81
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,040
My apologies.

82
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,040
Here.

83
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
What is it that angers you, sir?

84
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,360
Please be less aggressive.
These are new soldiers.

85
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,120
Who am I angry with?!
What has made me angry?!

86
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
Huh? Nothing!

87
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
He's not angry?

88
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,880
You must start by announcing
the goods you're selling.

89
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,640
- Announcing, My Lady?
- Hm.

90
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,640
Come, come, everyone.

91
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,280
Come, come. Gather round.

92
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,680
Look at this beautiful hat.
Are you interested?

93
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Shall you take one? Come and take one.

94
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,720
Aon, stop it.
That's a jar for private use.

95
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,440
<i>The one who is taking her to Mueang Khon</i>
<i>is the male servant who is close to her.</i>

96
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,120
<i>More importantly, he is quite charming.</i>

97
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
Pansaeng?

98
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,600
Has your leg wound healed?

99
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,600
Are you here with Va, sir?

100
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,440
Despite your feeble bladework,
you dared approach alone.

101
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,640
Such folly.

102
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, I fell

103
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,120
on a palm knife and cut my leg.

104
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,120
I shall not be able to get up
and welcome you properly.

105
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,080
Please forgive me, sir.

106
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,920
How much did you get from Luang Bovorntat?

107
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,960
What are you talking about, sir?

108
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,800
What did Luang Bovorntat do?

109
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,160
You are merely a pawn, Muen Vorachai.

110
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,480
If you are caught one day,

111
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
a pawn like you
shall be in the greatest trouble.

112
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,960
Do not help him.

113
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,760
Come and take my side.

114
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,360
Of late, Chavala's beauty has blossomed.

115
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,960
She is glowing more and more.

116
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,440
Perhaps you're taking
good care of my sister.

117
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,080
I imagine there must always
be food on the table.

118
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,440
I told you how great my sister is.

119
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,400
Shall I have my niece or nephew soon, sir?

120
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,560
I'm here to give you a fair warning.

121
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,040
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

122
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,720
The blade I wielded
was infused with magic.

123
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
By now, your wound
must be festering with worms,

124
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,880
burrowing deep into your bones.

125
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,920
You bastard! Did you use magic on me?!

126
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Pansaeng! You fooled me!

127
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
You bastard!

128
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Chavala!

129
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,880
If you need to be here, then come alone.
Do not ever bring your husband!

130
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,840
- Who?
- It's Pansaeng.

131
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,560
He came to make fun of me.

132
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,400
Is he here? What did he say to you?

133
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
I've learned that

134
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,920
you still sleep with Laor
in the servant's quarter, right?

135
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,000
And what of it?

136
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,720
It's bizarre.
Humans are born to be in pairs.

137
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Don't you ever feel the "need"?

138
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,400
Chai, don't speak your filthy words to me.

139
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,120
Have you two even hugged?

140
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,560
My cozy little soul.

141
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,240
There is nothing more cozy

142
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,360
than a warm embrace.

143
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
If this is all you have to say,

144
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
then go back inside.

145
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,400
Your filthy words
will only pollute this canal.

146
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,480
Help! Va fell into the canal!

147
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,680
Help! Va fell into the canal!

148
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,000
Help!

149
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,720
Help!

150
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,840
Va.

151
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,920
You'll love my sister.

152
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,640
Your magic will fade.

153
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
When that day comes, I shall stomp you.

154
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
- It was Chai. Chai pushed me.
- What?

155
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,600
- Chai!
- Wait. Don't go up yet.

156
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,040
Your clothes fell away.

157
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,400
Va!

158
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,280
What happened?

159
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,680
Laor, bring her some clothes.

160
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,720
Yes, sir.

161
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,320
Wait. Not that one, Laor!

162
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
Find some other clothes.

163
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,920
Yes, sir.

164
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,480
Here it is, Va.

165
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,920
Please be careful.

166
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,400
How did you fall into the water?
What happened?

167
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,800
It was Chai. He knew I couldn’t swim.

168
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,800
But he deliberately
pushed me into the water.

169
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,000
Sir.

170
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,600
Bring your lady inside.

171
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,960
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,360
Chai! Chai!

173
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,520
Come out at once, Chai!

174
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,280
Open the door!

175
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,480
When we were young,
you once pushed me into the water!

176
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,000
And you did it again!

177
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,680
You wicked brother! You bastard!

178
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
You vile monster!

179
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,720
Do you want me to die that much, Chai?!

180
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,560
Fine. I shall die right before your eyes.

181
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,000
Open the door! Open it and kill me!

182
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,320
Open up and watch me die! Open it!

183
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,840
You shall not die today.
You are a good person.

184
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,640
Both angels and humans love you.
You need not fear.

185
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,640
When in need, you seek help from me.

186
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,160
When I was no longer of use,
you pushed me to my death.

187
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
You claim that no one loves you.

188
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,760
Yet, do you love anyone, Chai?

189
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,320
I don't know…

190
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't know why you hurt me
or what you wanted.

191
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,520
But I have my heart and soul as well.

192
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,080
Why does our love differ, brother?

193
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,240
Huh?

194
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
I could not let you be in pain.

195
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,080
But you…

196
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
You were willing to kill me.

197
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,680
Were you really willing to kill me, Chai?!

198
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,120
You vile brother. You monster.

199
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Help! Va fell into the canal!

200
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,600
Are you still crying, Va?

201
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm only wondering

202
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,600
why Chai had to do it.

203
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,280
He pushed me into the canal

204
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,920
and called for help.

205
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,880
Was he calling for Khun Saengplarn?

206
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,320
He complains that you and Khun Saengplarn
don't spend nights together.

207
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,920
Pervert.
He only has obscenity on his mind.

208
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,840
Well, how does
Khun Saengplarn's love for you

209
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,040
benefit Muen Vorachai, My Lady?

210
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,360
What made him try so hard?
There was the medicine as well.

211
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,920
I do not know.

212
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,800
Perhaps he plans to use me
to kill Khun Saengplarn.

213
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,840
But it shall not happen.
He is unlike Chai.

214
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,680
He keeps meditating all day.

215
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,600
There's no way
he would have filthy thoughts.

216
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,280
Ugh.

217
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
What is happening right now?

218
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,320
You shoot with your hands,
but your legs are what matter most.

219
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,800
Stand firm.
Watch where you place your weight.

220
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
Then, aim well.

221
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,680
Goodness' sake, this is a military camp!
Who hangs clothes like this?!

222
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,640
Take them down!

223
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,560
But those are Aunt Tun's clothes, sir.

224
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Aunt Tun?

225
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,080
Yes, sir.

226
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,120
Aunt Tun has been the cook
at our camp since she was a young woman.

227
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,320
But now, her breasts
are practically down to her knees.

228
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
Ming!

229
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,840
When you talk about women,

230
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,720
show some respect. Do not mention…

231
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,160
Now, if anyone mentions breasts,
I shall kick them out of my camp!

232
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,920
Then, can we still teach
about breastplates, sir?

233
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,720
Can't we talk about
breast milk for babies, sir?

234
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,040
What about chicken breasts, sir?

235
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,400
All of you.

236
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
I shall not continue.
Instruct them yourselves!

237
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,040
- Sir?
- Sir.

238
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,720
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

239
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Could he be afraid of breasts?

240
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,320
Well, none of you mention it.

241
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,720
Ming! Pay attention.

242
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
I'm paying attention.

243
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,120
But I shall not use my full strength.

244
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,520
If I do, you will get hurt.

245
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,320
Easy!

246
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Do you want to kill me?

247
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,200
I don't have much time left.
I shall leave soon.

248
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,400
We shall not meet again.
I must learn quickly.

249
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
You…

250
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Ouch!

251
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,760
Laor! Laor.

252
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,000
Are you hurt?

253
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,720
Let me see.

254
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,280
Oh. It is all red.

255
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm fine. It will heal.

256
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,760
How is it fine?

257
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,920
Your beautiful face is now bruised.

258
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,320
What herbs do I need to use?

259
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,920
Get off of me.

260
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
It is fine if my face is wounded.
I shall let no one see me as a woman.

261
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
I don't like it.

262
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,000
How bizarre of you.
You shall be a woman no matter what.

263
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,080
No. Didn’t you claim
to see me as a little brother?

264
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,840
I am your little brother.

265
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,760
Remember.

266
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,320
Do not ever see me as a woman again.

267
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,560
Again!

268
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,160
Quickly, Ming.

269
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,400
Laor! Laor! Careful!

270
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,440
It is late. Why are you up on the house?

271
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,560
I saw that the lamps were not lit,

272
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
so I came up to take a look.

273
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
Oh.

274
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,840
Since that day,

275
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I haven't seen you.

276
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
Please accept my thanks for saving my life

277
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,800
- when I was about to drown.
- Enough.

278
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,960
Do not mention what happened that day.

279
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,280
Yes, sir.

280
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,240
How about your plan
to relocate to Mueang Khon?

281
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,000
I planned to leave in a month, sir.

282
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,520
Does it take that long?

283
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,680
I shall try to leave sooner.

284
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,760
Do you know about viewing distance?

285
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
Sir?

286
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,880
From now on,

287
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,120
stay at least
as far away as my viewing distance.

288
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,480
You meant

289
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,200
stay away from you.

290
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,240
- Do not let you see me.
- Correct.

291
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,080
Why must I be sad?

292
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,680
For heaven's sake!

293
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,360
Women really are trouble!

294
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,120
From now on, we must inspect every wagon

295
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
and every boat.

296
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,880
What are we searching for, sir?

297
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,440
This is the record of Muen Vorachai.

298
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,320
It states

299
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,760
which wagons carried which goods
through this checkpoint each day.

300
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,200
Is Muen Vorachai
in charge of this customs checkpoint?

301
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,200
If he is truly in league
with Luang Bovorntat,

302
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,840
illegal goods will likely be trafficked

303
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,120
through this checkpoint.

304
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Then, any wagons or boats
not listed in the record

305
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
must be illegal.

306
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Seize those people and goods.

307
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,040
Then we shall be able
to apprehend Luang Bovorntat.

308
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,440
Take turns to keep watch.

309
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,720
One day, we shall succeed
in bringing them to justice.

310
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,040
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,920
Your food and water, sir.

312
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,880
Sir, what are you watching?

313
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,480
I'm watching these people being obscene.

314
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Sir, wait!

315
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,920
What are you going to do, sir?

316
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Well, look at them!
Such a disgusting sight!

317
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,760
They are husband and wife, sir.
Seems like newlyweds.

318
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
Why does he seem frustrated lately?

319
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,159
Where is the whetstone?

320
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,760
I've put it here. Where did it go? Hey.

321
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,880
Where is the whetstone?

322
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,120
It is behind the water jars.
I was using it the other day.

323
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,239
Please find it and leave, sir.

324
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,080
I can't find it. How am I
supposed to leave? And…

325
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,400
And what's the matter with you?

326
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,639
Why do you need to hide?

327
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,080
- Come here.
- Oh. Sir, I shall not go.

328
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,200
Come out here.

329
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
What's the matter? Huh?

330
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,880
- What's the matter?
- Right.

331
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,920
You told me to stay away.
Stay out of your sight.

332
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,360
And why are you holding me?

333
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,200
Didn't you say
you wouldn't touch me or hold me?

334
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,720
Find the stone for me.

335
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,920
It is almost as big as a jar.
Why couldn't you see?

336
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,760
Here!

337
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,560
- Hey!
- The whetstone!

338
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,000
It almost hit my foot!

339
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Aren't you invulnerable, sir?

340
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,920
A stone wouldn't be able to hurt you.

341
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,520
Still looking at me?
Didn't you hate to see me?

342
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,080
Goodness!

343
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,400
I am exhausted too!

344
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,560
If his clothes have bloodstains,
they must be boiled first.

345
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,600
Do it like this. Understood?

346
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
Ugh! Such a burden.

347
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,960
I can just request a new shirt for him

348
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,560
and that would be it.

349
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,880
Tian, new clothes are stiff and smell bad.
It wouldn't be good.

350
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,440
Tian. Khun Sangplarn
doesn't want any women near him.

351
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
So, you must learn

352
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,080
to take care of him, and you shall
be able to take care of yourself as well.

353
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,040
- Yes, My Lady.
- Hm.

354
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
Here. Try it.

355
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,760
Easy, is it?

356
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm back.

357
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,880
Is it enough?

358
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,760
Almost. In about a week, we shall leave.

359
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,480
In one week's time,

360
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,920
we shall be out of this hell.

361
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Yes.

362
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,080
I am ready as well.

363
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,840
If we make it

364
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,280
and can really start anew,
are you going to court Lady Va?

365
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,720
Well…

366
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,920
I saw right through you. You have been
in love with her since your youth.

367
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
I shall ask you, Saiyud.

368
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,760
Once you are free,
what do you intend to do?

369
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,280
I…

370
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,520
I wish to ordain as a nun,

371
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,240
to wash away all the filth within me.

372
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
You bear no filth within you.

373
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,640
In my eyes, you are the most beautiful

374
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,960
and pure.

375
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,240
You are not what you think of, Saiyud.

376
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,800
Stop being hard on yourself.

377
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,800
Thank you.

378
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,760
Saiyud.

379
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,760
If I am to impress Lady Va,
what must I do?

380
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,640
You said you're not interested in her.

381
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,040
Fine. Keep it to yourself.

382
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,320
Embrace and protect.

383
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,480
Drink this medicine.

384
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
I shall take care of you.

385
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,640
Saiyud.

386
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,760
Can you say it again?

387
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,320
It sounds really beautiful.

388
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,760
Women

389
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,320
are drawn to men

390
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,720
who embrace and protect them.

391
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,720
Embrace

392
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,280
and protect.

393
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,520
- Sir! Sir!
- What?

394
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,960
Please hurry, sir.
Two wagons are not listed in the record.

395
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,160
- Huh?
- The goods must be illegal, sir.

396
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,280
Hey! We are being followed!

397
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,840
Pansaeng is chasing our wagons again.

398
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,080
It is not Pansaeng down there.

399
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,800
I am up here,

400
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,360
Luang Bovorntat.

401
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,680
Go!

402
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
You schemed to trick me.

403
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,480
This time, I shall bring you

404
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,600
before the magistrate as a rebel!

405
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,640
<i>Stay put, Ming.</i>
<i>We shall be free in no time.</i>

406
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,760
<i>His magic is merely trickery.</i>

407
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,800
Luang Bovorntat's men.

408
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,800
You shall not get away this time.

409
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,360
Master Taen.

410
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,800
Is it Taen Seenil you are addressing?

411
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,400
Pansaeng!

412
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,640
As I thought,

413
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,680
you are a disciple of Taen Seenil.

414
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,440
Your master is hard to find,
yet you are truly fortunate

415
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,680
to be able to see him so often.

416
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,760
Please bring me to him someday, My Lord.

417
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,800
I really wish to see him.

418
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,160
What is your business here?!

419
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,920
You claimed that I practice dark magic.

420
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,680
Yet, what made you learn
that condemned sorcery yourself?

421
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,480
Because there is darkness like yourself.

422
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,680
To deal with darkness,

423
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,800
I need to hone dark arts!

424
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,200
For every insurrection,
the noblemen would fight each other.

425
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,480
But only the citizens

426
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,400
would get injured and die.

427
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,960
The power you seek
comes at the cost of war and death.

428
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,720
How could you ever find peace?

429
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,960
You shall never understand.

430
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,320
Your father was but a peasant

431
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,040
with a minor rank in a far-off region.

432
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,400
Yes.

433
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,800
Small cities
have no soldiers to fight off thieves.

434
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,720
It was this
that gave Taen Seenil the nerve

435
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,120
to storm the governor's house,
my father's house, and massacre everyone!

436
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,080
Once the governor died,

437
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,560
people fled their homes
in fear of Taen Seenil.

438
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,240
All are aware of Tean Seenil's reputation.

439
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,400
But no one remembers your father's name!

440
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,080
For this world

441
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,920
belongs only to the victors!

442
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Are only noblemen
entitled to be the victors?

443
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,080
Noblemen

444
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,720
were born to be victorious!

445
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,960
Those born in the palace,
like me, are tigers!

446
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,360
Those born to poverty,
like you, are deer, tigers' prey!

447
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,000
Tigers and deer are wild animals.

448
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,320
They are destined
to be either hunters or prey,

449
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,080
unlike humans.

450
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
Humans bridge all disparities

451
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,600
with mercy.

452
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,600
If you are still human,

453
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,600
do not use those weapons to destroy
the lives of other human beings.

454
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,360
Human beings were never equal.

455
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,880
Our fingers are not of equal lengths!
What do you expect?!

456
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
Very well.

457
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,320
If you do not heed my words,

458
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,840
you shall face
the consequences under the law.

459
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,920
A tiger

460
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,040
shall belong in a cage.

461
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,240
Consequences under the law.

462
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,120
Pansaeng!
What are you going to do, Pansaeng?!

463
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,280
Pansaeng!

464
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,240
You are drunk now!

465
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,640
Come here! Come.

466
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,680
- What?
- This way, My Lord.

467
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,800
- Come here!
- Catch me, My Lord.

468
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,120
I shall find you!

469
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,080
Oh.

470
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,320
Hey.

471
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,000
Someone is reporting a crime, My Lord.

472
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,440
Who might it be?

473
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,720
It’s late. It’s time to rest.

474
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,600
Tell them to come back tomorrow.

475
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,240
I cannot, sir.
This is an important matter.

476
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,880
There is arms trafficking, which
could link to an insurrection, My Lord.

477
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,040
Who?

478
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,360
Luang Bovorntat, My Lord.

479
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,080
Luang Bovorntat?

480
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,240
I've chased the wagons

481
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,640
and discovered a large quantity
of arms stored on his land.

482
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,320
An insurrection?

483
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,720
Yes, My Lord.

484
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,240
This is a significant matter.

485
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,520
I shall send my good men with you tonight.

486
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Yes, My Lord.

487
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,920
Spread out. Watch this storage.

488
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,320
Do not let anyone in or out!

489
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,320
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

490
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,560
Wait.

491
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,960
You need not leave.

492
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,120
The viewing distance can be determined.

493
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,560
But we could never do it
with the distance in our hearts.

494
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
The distance in our hearts?

495
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,120
Well, about that whole viewing distance,

496
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,480
we shall forget it.

497
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,200
Are you, perhaps,

498
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,200
seeking to apologize to me, sir?

499
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,680
What?

500
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,600
You are such…

501
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,760
Hm.

502
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Well, I shall apologize.

503
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,640
My apologies.

504
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,720
Yes, sir.

505
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,000
And what is it you are doing?

506
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,400
I am seeing Ayothaya.

507
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,200
Soon, I shall no longer see it.

508
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,240
Did you gather enough money?

509
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,200
I am almost ready.

510
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,400
In fact, all the royal gifts

511
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,280
bestowed during our wedding are yours.

512
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,000
You can take them.
They are in a safe in my bedroom.

513
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,320
No, sir.

514
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,560
There is no greater wedding gift
than you saving my life.

515
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,040
And I didn't truly marry you.

516
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
It is not right to take them.

517
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,120
You have my thanks, sir.

518
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,640
Ayothatya under the moonlight

519
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,200
is truly beautiful.

520
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,640
It is.

521
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,480
Its beauty is to die for.

522
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,840
I shall gladly sacrifice myself

523
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,480
for such peace.

524
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,080
And I did achieve it today.

525
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,480
I protected the city
from the insurrection.

526
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,920
Did you, sir?

527
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,760
Are they the owners
of the illegal caravan from before?

528
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,560
Perhaps you cannot tell me.

529
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,120
It is fine.

530
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,160
Do you know

531
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,160
what the greatest kind of happiness is?

532
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,040
It is a good night's sleep.

533
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,160
No anxious feelings.

534
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,400
No waking up during the night.

535
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,640
No worries about life.

536
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,240
This is the Ayothaya of my dreams.

537
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,800
A peaceful night

538
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,200
in a serene city.

539
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,960
If I leave this place,

540
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,120
I shall sleep soundly at night.

541
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,400
It’s just a pity that it’s not Ayothaya.

542
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,120
Wait, Lady Va.

543
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,440
There is one thing I must ask you.

544
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,440
I am aware
that you enjoy crafting perfume.

545
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,000
So, I want to know if you have any perfume

546
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,160
that shall help me sleep.

547
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,080
Jasmine's fragrance.

548
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,040
Mix it with…

549
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,160
this.

550
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,280
We shall try this scent.

551
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,720
Hm.

552
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,440
Here.

553
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,360
This is not it.

554
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,840
It is not?

555
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,960
No.

556
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,200
Oh.

557
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,600
Then, what scent are you talking about?

558
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,360
It is unlike any other scent in the house.

559
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,120
I have been searching for it,

560
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,040
but there is nothing like it.

561
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,200
Oh.

562
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,560
What? Sir.

563
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,040
Since my youth,

564
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,680
nightmares have plagued me,
born of resentment and loneliness.

565
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,880
But that night, I had a deep sleep

566
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,800
- and dreamed a good dream, unlike before.
- That night?

567
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,400
Which flower is used to make your perfume?

568
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,840
It is from various flowers,
but mainly bullet woods.

569
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,520
No. This is not the one.

570
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:50,960
Well, perfume smells different
on each person's skin.

571
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,760
Shall I never again
know such a peaceful night’s rest?

572
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,680
I shall make

573
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,080
the candle to fill your room
with this scent tomorrow.

574
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,680
Really?

575
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,880
Yes.

576
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,640
My Lord, Luang Bovorntat
is amassing arms for the insurrection.

577
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,400
You've hidden arms and saltpeter.

578
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,880
I have evidence and witnesses.

579
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,080
Do you defend his honor

580
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,920
or conspire with him in rebellion?

581
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,080
Stop at once, Pansaeng!

582
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,880
What are you planning?

583
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,240
Where did you get this much money?

584
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,720
Aon, get away!

585
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,840
I hereby summon evil spirits

586
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,560
to feast upon
your sinister soul, Muen Vorachai.

587
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,520
I only know that today I have some hope.

588
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,080
<i>Only hope is enough.</i>

589
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,160
Lady Pim. Khun Saengplarn
doesn't wish to marry you

590
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,760
because he truly loves me.

591
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,520
Are you in love with me?

592
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,640
You haven’t bedded each other, have you?

593
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,520
