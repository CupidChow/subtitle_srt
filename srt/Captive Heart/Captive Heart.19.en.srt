1
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Hey! Who is that?! I said stop!

2
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,120
Let the lanterns
of Dharmachakra shine bright!

3
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,400
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives.

4
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,320
The soldiers of the Ministry
of the Treasury are now mine.

5
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Release!

6
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
Power of the sun, to me!

7
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
Where are you lot going?!

8
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
- There are two Masters.
- I am the real Prai.

9
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
May the love for our land

10
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,560
strengthen my spirit.

11
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,360
I must not die.

12
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,440
He has awakened the effigies.

13
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,680
How did he regain his magic?
Did you not say he cannot take a wife?

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
Not him!

15
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Here. Open up.

16
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
In a moment, dear.

17
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,520
You have been boiling
the herbs since morning.

18
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,640
You are worried about others,
yet you remain unfed.

19
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Here.

20
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,920
Dear. This recipe
requires precise temperature.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
I do not wish to fail Chai's treatment.

22
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
Take it.

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Sir.

24
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,560
People are protesting at the gate.

25
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,920
Prai took the lives of our kin.

26
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,640
We are displeased
with your decision to spare him.

27
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,480
People say that
you were studying alongside him.

28
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,040
You are showing favoritism.
You should bring him to justice.

29
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,440
Yet you did no such thing!

30
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
Prai actually--

31
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
We shall report to the authorities

32
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,000
about your omission of duty!

33
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,920
He has brought down countless thieves.
Has he no merit at all?

34
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,960
Sons were killed
and daughters were violated!

35
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,080
You do not understand
what we have been through!

36
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
- Punish him!
- Punish him!

37
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
- Punish him! Punish him!
- Punish him! Punish him!

38
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,280
- Punish him! Punish him!
- Punish him! Punish him!

39
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,160
- Punish him! Punish him!
- Jaokhun Kaew is here, sir.

40
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,760
- Punish him! Punish him!
- He entered through the back.

41
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,880
- Punish him! Punish him!
- He did not wish to face them.

42
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,880
- Punish him! Punish him!
- Punish him! Punish him!

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,040
There are not only reports
from the citizens.

44
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
Luang Bovorntat has also prosecuted you

45
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,080
and demanded me to bring you on trial.

46
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,200
- Was it about Prai?
- Yes.

47
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,480
That is why I must come to ask you

48
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,960
what it was all about.

49
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
You have shown me mercy

50
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
by informing me prior to the trial.

51
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,040
But please question me in court.

52
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,520
With the matter becoming this major,

53
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,640
perhaps I must tell the truth.

54
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,960
The magic of Pansaeng and Prai

55
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,360
are both condemned dark magic.

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,680
It is against the Royal Household Law.

57
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,320
Those who study and wield it

58
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,840
are punishable by execution.

59
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
You practice black magic as well.

60
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,360
Yet you speak of others.

61
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,240
Both were studying under the same master.

62
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,160
Hence, they are planning
an insurrection together.

63
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,400
I request that
the Minister of the Royal Household

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
sentences him to an execution.

65
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,320
Let us hear from the accused.

66
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
The truth is

67
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,160
there are the real Prai

68
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,160
and an imposter.

69
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
After his wife died,

70
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,080
the real Prai lost his sanity.

71
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,400
Then, Taen Seenil,

72
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,040
having mastered Asoraveda,
has been using his appearance

73
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
and his name

74
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
to raid and slaughter
the citizens, My Lord.

75
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,600
The real Prai?

76
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
The false Prai?

77
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
What truly is all this?

78
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,440
Are you implying
that the killer of my parents

79
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,000
was Taen Seenil?

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,920
Taen Seenil was known
for raiding villages.

81
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
Why must he use Prai's name?

82
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,720
Taen Seenil

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,080
is wielding Asoraveda? Nonsense, My Lord.

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,640
Only Pansaeng and Prai

85
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,880
practice the same condemned dark arts

86
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,040
and is truly fond of one another.

87
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,160
As of late,
Prai has been killing and raping

88
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
in a monstrous way similar to Taen Seenil.

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,000
So, he was a different Prai.

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,080
I believe him.

91
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,240
Lady Pim.

92
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
Lady Pim.

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,760
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,280
I am only worried about him.

95
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Why? Am I not allowed to?

96
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,640
I have not seen you for a while.
I thought…

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,440
You truly are persistent, are you not?

98
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,760
My love for someone's husband
shall never change.

99
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
Is admiring in secret against any law?

100
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,000
Taen Seenil has emerged
after the prison breakout.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
No one saw his true form,

102
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
except

103
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,200
Jaokhun Singh's men.

104
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
- They are all on the same side.
- Insolent!

105
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,640
How dare you suggest
I conspire with Taen Seenil?

106
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,000
During the prison breakout, many prisoners

107
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,120
have seen me and my men

108
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,280
fighting off Taen Seenil.

109
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,560
What if it was merely a ruse, My Lord?

110
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,440
Taen Seenil is Prai's master

111
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,760
and probably Pansaeng's as well.

112
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,880
Pansaeng was pretending
to fight Taen Seenil

113
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,760
to fool us nobles.

114
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
In truth, they are all conspiring.

115
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,800
How could I conspire with him

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,560
when he is the killer of my parents?

117
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,760
I brought the real Prai
to defeat the imposter.

118
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
When the imposter reverted to Taen Seenil,

119
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,400
those thieves were there
to witness it as well!

120
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,720
I request to present a witness, My Lord.

121
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,960
State your name and allegiance.

122
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,520
My name is Duang
from Ban Ta Khian Thong, My Lord.

123
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,320
I am a thief under Master Prai.

124
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
State your business.

125
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
I come to tell the truth.
I saw with my own eyes

126
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,120
that Khun Saengplarn came to us

127
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
to help Prai set up
the camp for us thieves.

128
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Liar. You have falsely accused me.

129
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,600
Look closely.

130
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
I am Prai's disciple

131
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,480
who talked to you the other day, am I not?

132
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,840
Did you see the fight
between Prai and the imposter?

133
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,400
Did you truly see Taen Seenil?

134
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,520
No, My Lord.

135
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
He is a false witness, My Lord!

136
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,560
Silence! Silence!

137
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,720
Khun Saengplarn.

138
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,520
Can you bring Prai on trial?

139
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,760
I cannot bring Prai
into the city, My Lord.

140
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,680
If I do,

141
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,040
the citizens will try to kill him
even before he reaches the court.

142
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,360
Do you see, My Lord?

143
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,640
He is truly concerned about his senior.

144
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,200
Do you have
any other thieves as witnesses?

145
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,680
I do not, My Lord.

146
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,160
I must protect them as well.

147
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
It appears that
he prioritizes their safety.

148
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,360
Pansaeng is certainly conspiring with Prai

149
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,840
and Taen Seenil as well, My Lord.

150
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,400
These wielders of dark magic,

151
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,760
Pansaeng, Taen Seenil, and Prai.

152
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,440
The three of them are conspiring
to seize the power of Ayothaya.

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,840
Enough. This is getting out of hand.

154
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,000
It is Luang Bovorntat
who is planning an insurrection.

155
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,600
My Lord.

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,240
If you decide to accuse me
without evidence,

157
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,480
I will be able to prosecute you as well.

158
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,440
Silence. We shall discuss
only the matter at hand.

159
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Minister of the Royal Household.

160
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
You must judge him now.

161
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
The insurrection is yet to come.

162
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,840
But his practice of dark arts
is against the Royal Household Law.

163
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,880
And he has omitted his duty

164
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,640
out of personal favoritism.

165
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
We must imprison him.

166
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
- We cannot!
- We cannot!

167
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,640
If he is imprisoned,
who will protect our land?

168
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,800
I agree. If we imprison him,

169
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,120
who would fight off Taen Seenil?

170
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,600
Call off the sentence!

171
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,200
Pansaeng is a rebel, My Lord.

172
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
He is the disciple of Taen Seenil,
as well as Prai.

173
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
Put him in prison, My Lord.

174
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,840
Jaokhun Kaew.

175
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,200
You must judge him at once.

176
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
If not,

177
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
you are omitting your duty.

178
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,240
By the power of the law
of the city of Ayothaya,

179
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,880
I hereby

180
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,440
judge Khun Saengplarn to be guilty

181
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
of practicing dark magic,

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,400
abusing unnatural power,

183
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,160
and omitting his duty.

184
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,320
Khun Saengplarn
shall be imprisoned for six months.

185
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
Have you allowed yourself to be held

186
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
because you know spells
to unbind the locks?

187
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
It fell short, My Lord.

188
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,080
I am confined with yantra.

189
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,560
Taen Seenil's yantra.

190
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,200
Bovorntat.

191
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,840
He has prepared this.

192
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,840
He confined you
to allow their rebel forces

193
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,080
to approach the city easily.

194
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
Please keep calm, My Lord.

195
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Master Nandha and Prai can still save us.

196
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
This cell

197
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
shall not be able to hold me for long.

198
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,360
At long last,

199
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
you are here in prison with me.

200
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,000
Harn!

201
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,640
Harn!

202
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Yong. Keep calm and be civil.
Do not use violence.

203
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,160
- Harn!
- Yong.

204
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
Bua. Greetings.

205
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,160
You have led those people
to prosecute Khun Saengplarn!

206
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,600
Those people

207
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,600
lost their families to Prai!

208
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,240
They would prosecute him without me!

209
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,960
They do not know him!

210
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Their grief is justified.

211
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,560
But you have fought alongside him
in countless battles.

212
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
You cannot be this upset with him!

213
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,000
Because I would gladly die for him,

214
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
his actions upset me the most!

215
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,880
But there are really two Prais.

216
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,000
Lady Chavala found the real one

217
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,520
and cured him of his insanity.
So, we know it is him.

218
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
You said he is insane.

219
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,560
- A madman can say anything.
- Enough!

220
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Is there no forgiveness for him?

221
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,720
Does the kindness
he showed you all these years

222
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,360
mean nothing to you?!

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,520
That kindness

224
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,520
was all repaid through my duty!

225
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,800
We are settled!

226
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
And you, Yong!

227
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
I do not care if you continue to visit me.

228
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,680
I am who I am.

229
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,400
If you deem me ungrateful, so be it!

230
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,599
Darn it!

231
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,120
Khun Saengplarn asked us to move here

232
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,800
since things are depressing
for you, My Lady.

233
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
I am truly depressed, Saiyud.

234
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,320
A home without him

235
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,000
is not worth living in.

236
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Where should we spend our nights, My Lady?

237
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Stay in the raft house.

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,480
Good thing is, we shall be able
to talk till morning like before.

239
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,920
Come. I shall walk you there.

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,040
Come.

241
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,600
Saiyud.

242
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,440
Saiyud.

243
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
What is wrong with you?

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,360
I am three months pregnant.

245
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,120
Really, Saiyud?

246
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Saiyud. I am most glad.

247
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,120
You should know that

248
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,720
this child has warmed my heart.

249
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,200
My nibling. My dear nibling.

250
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,080
This is Aunt Va. Your aunt Va.

251
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,920
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

252
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,880
Oh, it is but a bean.
It shall not hear you, My Lady.

253
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,120
Aon.

254
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,560
Do you wish for a son or a daughter?

255
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,040
Either shall be fine, My Lady.

256
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,240
I am delighted.

257
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
But once I heard Khun Saengplarn
was imprisoned last night,

258
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,120
I could not sleep.

259
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,480
Why must I be pregnant now?

260
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,440
The fate of Ayothaya is truly uncertain.

261
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,760
For hundreds of years,

262
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,480
we have been upholding this land.

263
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,520
Tens of thousands
have fought and died to preserve it.

264
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,480
We must not allow it
to fall under Taen Seenil.

265
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
We all must fight.

266
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
We must protect Ayothaya for our children.

267
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,680
Upon learning of my child's coming,

268
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,160
my willpower has soared.

269
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,600
I do think that the land
my child will grow in

270
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,040
must be safe and peaceful.

271
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
My child.

272
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,760
I shall fight with my life

273
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,240
for your livelihood in Ayothaya.

274
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
See, Saiyud?

275
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,920
This child is our motivation.

276
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
We must fight for it.

277
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,920
What shall you do next, My Lady?

278
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,480
Does it involve the Dharmachakra Order?

279
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,480
Yes, Saiyud.

280
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,640
Khun Saengplarn is not here, but I am.

281
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,320
He is my example.

282
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,480
I only need to think and do
they way Khun Saengplarn does.

283
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
Take some medicine.

284
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Easy.

285
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,800
Easy.

286
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
It spilled, Chai.

287
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,960
How are you supposed to recover?

288
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,840
I can live no longer.

289
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,040
I cannot.

290
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,360
Chai.

291
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,360
Chai.

292
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,760
You must fight it.
I shall boil the herbs again.

293
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,720
You must take it.

294
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,800
Chai.

295
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,240
Chai…

296
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,680
Wake up and take some more medicine.

297
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
Chai…

298
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,840
Chai.

299
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,120
<i>Luang Bovorntat's force</i>
<i>is marching to capture you.</i>

300
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,200
<i>Have you prepared your defense?</i>

301
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>Are there many?</i>
<i>Tell them to bring all they have.</i>

302
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
<i>At last, something exciting for me.</i>

303
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,240
Go. Go.

304
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600
Horses!

305
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,680
The soldiers are coming for us!

306
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,360
Everyone! Our camp
shall be attacked! Brace yourselves!

307
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,360
No need.

308
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,480
No need for swords. Be at ease!

309
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,240
They are approaching!

310
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,240
I said you do not need them.
Put them down.

311
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,240
Should we put them down?

312
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
I will not. I do not believe him.

313
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,040
Come at us!

314
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,400
I do not fear you! Come!

315
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,320
Where have they gone?

316
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,360
Why do they not approach?

317
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,240
Why are they only looking?

318
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,840
The illusion magic.

319
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,160
Woo!

320
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,680
You fools! You idiots!

321
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,800
They moved. Go!

322
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,640
Darn it.

323
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,680
Prai's magic is truly potent, all of you!

324
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,720
Prai is the great sorcerer of this land!

325
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,400
Prai! Prai! Prai!

326
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
You wicked.

327
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,600
You snake.

328
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,000
What?

329
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,520
My life ended up like this because of you.

330
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,120
You are dying,
yet you remain blind to your faults.

331
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,840
You're also trapped in the magic barrier.

332
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,480
You shall die here as well.

333
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
I was put in here

334
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,720
because of you.

335
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,520
Because of me?

336
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,280
For the past few days of my stay,

337
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,400
I have heard you talk
in your sleep at night.

338
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
I shall be a good person,

339
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,160
putting the welfare of others

340
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,920
before my own.

341
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,560
I shall be the servant of this land

342
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
and uphold the well-being

343
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,800
of its people.

344
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,760
<i>‪In our final moments,</i>

345
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,120
we will ponder unfinished business.

346
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,560
You have yet to fulfill
a promise made to your parents.

347
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
It is not your business.

348
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,320
You could not be as good as your sister.

349
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,880
So, you have resorted to wickedness
because it was easier.

350
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,080
But before you knew that path
was more cruel than good,

351
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,280
you killed someone.

352
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,880
Hence,

353
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,160
your right to redemption is gone.

354
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,160
Silence.

355
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Stop your nonsense.

356
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
If you wish to do even better
than your sister, I know a way.

357
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,560
She would not see it coming.

358
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,840
Do you wish to know?

359
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,800
How many years did it take
for the customs officers

360
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,120
to manage this?

361
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,920
These are the noble families

362
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
and rich merchants
who are corrupt, My Lord.

363
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,920
There are over ten families.

364
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,680
The most corrupt is Luang Bovorntat.

365
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
There is clear evidence.

366
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,960
Next in line is Jaokhun Thammanart,
who is deceased.

367
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,680
There is Jaokhun Nakorn.

368
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,840
And Jaokhun Kaset as well?

369
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,800
No wonder

370
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
he was hesitant

371
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,200
to swear his allegiance
to the king with me.

372
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,520
The law of Ayothaya
grants customs officers the authority

373
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,160
to unite should they unanimously perceive

374
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
any officials defrauding public wealth.

375
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,520
They are permitted
to bring evidence directly to the king,

376
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,520
for the prosecution

377
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
or removal of those nobles.

378
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,600
They can announce this
for the public to know as well.

379
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,400
In the past, the citizens
would condemn the corrupt

380
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,280
and drive out their families
to the other lands.

381
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,000
Then, we shall seize
the forces of those nobles

382
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,040
in our effort to fight off Taen Seenil.

383
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,560
But it may take as long as six months
to sort out the prosecution.

384
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,080
By that time,

385
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Luang Bovorntat and Taen Seenil

386
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,120
would have amassed their forces

387
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,080
and raided the royal palace.

388
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,000
Then, hear this.

389
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
I shall use this evidence as a threat

390
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
and convince them

391
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,680
to join our side willingly.

392
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,600
How dare those officers
plan to prosecute us?!

393
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
I would rather not speak
of corrupt merchants.

394
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,280
But the corrupt nobles

395
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,400
who are supposed to care
for people's well-being

396
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,720
are most disgusting.

397
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
We were only doing some business dealings.

398
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,280
It was nothing major, Joakhun.

399
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,840
You may think
that accepting tribute and bribes

400
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,000
is common practice among officials.

401
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,440
But it is truly a disease

402
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,840
born from within ourselves.

403
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,920
It shall grow day by day
without anyone noticing.

404
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,840
And when our nation collapses,

405
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
you would not even realize.

406
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,880
I fully understand now.

407
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,640
Tell us what we must do then.

408
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
At this time,

409
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,200
Luang Bovorntat and Taen Seenil
are planning an insurrection.

410
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,760
Hand me the commander seals
of the Ministry of the Capital

411
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
and the Ministry of Agriculture.

412
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,440
If you do not comply,
I shall reveal this evidence

413
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
and you shall face
public sanction from the citizens.

414
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,520
Those officers are becoming arrogant.
We must deal with them.

415
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,840
I shall send my men
to teach them a lesson.

416
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,520
Good.

417
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,400
Greetings, Jom.

418
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,080
The wheel has turned this way.

419
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,160
Please entrust them to me, My Lady.
I shall keep them safe.

420
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,400
CUSTOMS RECORD

421
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,960
My Lady, please be careful.

422
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Should something happen to you,

423
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,640
the Dharmachakra Order shall lose its way.

424
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
It is done.

425
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,480
- Are you tired?
- No, what of you, Va?

426
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,400
It is a good time now. We fight.

427
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,080
Why are you following me?

428
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,639
Someone wants
the female customs officer dead.

429
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,639
And who is that?

430
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,239
- None of my business!
- Laor.

431
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,159
‪SAN CHAO KAO MARKET

432
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,440
- Get him!
- Die!

433
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,000
A map of the corrupt officials

434
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,480
exposed by the united
customs officers, My Lord?

435
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,920
Your name is on the map as well,

436
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,480
as the first culprit.

437
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,199
Did Jaokhun Singh not inform you?

438
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I do not see its significance, My Lord.

439
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,520
Because my intention

440
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,160
is to create a blank slate anyway.

441
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,320
So, you are the one…

442
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
- planning an insurrection.
- And what of it?

443
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,720
Everyone seeks greater power.

444
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,960
Jaokhun Singh is using the king's name
to push other families aside

445
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,800
and aim for the absolute power,
not unlike me.

446
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,760
That is why he threatens you.

447
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,640
There are only 15 customs officers.
It shall be easy.

448
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
We only need to kill them one by one.

449
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,440
I tried, but the people saved her.

450
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,120
Who are these daring citizens?

451
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,160
It was reported that there was
a gathering near Wat Kuti Thong.

452
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,840
They are forming some sort of army.

453
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,160
I am sending my men to observe tonight.

454
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I understand that fear grips you all.

455
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Both the corrupt nobles

456
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,560
and the dark sorcerer

457
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,920
are coming for us at the same time.

458
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,200
Our homeland is in imminent danger.

459
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,800
What awaits us is more powerful

460
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
than we could imagine.
But I am asking all of you.

461
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,960
If those powerful beings
are truly victorious,

462
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,960
strong animals
such as lions, tigers, or elephants

463
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
must have ruled the lands by now. But why?

464
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,200
Why do seemingly insignificant people
such as us still prevail?

465
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,680
Because we possess two things.

466
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,000
Wisdom and alliance.

467
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,400
Ayothaya, my motherland.

468
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Believe in yourselves,
and steady your minds.

469
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,560
Light the darkness in your hearts,

470
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,200
and let it shine bright again.

471
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,840
Let the lanterns
of Dharmachakra shine bright!

472
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,120
We shall protect Ayothaya with our lives!

473
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,840
They all suddenly vanished.

474
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Where have they gone?

475
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
If they can truly form a secret army,

476
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,760
that means there is one additional

477
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,000
army of citizens for them to command.

478
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Regardless. My Lords,
the two of you must choose.

479
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,760
Which side are you on?

480
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,360
Is Taen Seenil truly your master?

481
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,600
And has he truly mastered the Asoraveda?

482
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,760
Master Taen

483
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,320
is much more powerful than Pansaeng.

484
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,080
He shall secure our victory.

485
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640
Then,

486
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,480
the two of you

487
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
will no longer need to worry
about the map of the corrupt.

488
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,120
Let us overturn everything

489
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,920
and start the new dynasty of Ayothaya.

490
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,400
We three families shall reign together.

491
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,160
Not yet.

492
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,200
I shall not yet
give my forces to either side

493
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,480
until it is clear who the victor is.

494
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,320
I am telling you I will emerge victorious!

495
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,800
Let us leave.

496
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Wait.

497
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,040
Hear this.

498
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,240
If the two of you

499
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,920
are still frightened
by the map and customs records,

500
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,680
I shall get rid of them, My Lords.

501
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,400
I have sent someone
to follow that false witness

502
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,560
to extract the truth from him.

503
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,360
But it was too late.

504
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,520
He rushed out of the city.

505
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,360
Luang Bovorntat is truly wicked.

506
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,680
This angers me so much.

507
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
You need not worry.

508
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,880
This cell shall not hold me for long.

509
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,520
But if I break out now,
it shall fall into Luang Bovorntat's plan

510
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,920
to accuse me of planning an insurrection.

511
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,440
But there is one thing

512
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I must ask of you, My Lord.

513
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,040
What is it?

514
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,200
I wish to keep the Dharmachakra records

515
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,480
and the map of the corrupt officials

516
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,800
in the royal archive under your care.

517
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,320
Crocodile! Crocodile! Flee! Flee from it!

518
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,080
Crocodile!

519
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,360
Laor! Faster! Swim here!

520
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,680
Laor, swim faster! Here!

521
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
Oh, Ming?

522
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,360
What are you doing here?
I thought it was Laor.

523
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,080
And you. How did you get here?

524
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,680
Have you seen Laor bathe?

525
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,120
This is the dock
where the residents bathe.

526
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
And how could you take a bath here?

527
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,160
Why must you see Laor bathe?

528
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
- You are wrong.
- It is you.

529
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,800
Ming. Thong.

530
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
- Yes?
- What are you two talking about?

531
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,840
Here.

532
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,880
I am here to thank Thong. He gave me this.

533
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,000
- Uh, yes. Yes.
- Yes.

534
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
My mother's recipe.

535
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,960
I heard loud voices
and thought you two were fighting.

536
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,960
- No, we were not!
- No, we were not!

537
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,440
We love each other. Is that right?

538
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,240
- Yes.
- Right, Thong?

539
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,080
- Thank you for this.
- It is fine.

540
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,800
I am hungry now.

541
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Take a seat, Thong.
I will bring you water.

542
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,640
Water, Thong.

543
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,680
Thank you.

544
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Ming has been staying here
for many nights now.

545
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,080
What? Why?

546
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,960
He has a house, does he not?
Why must he stay here?

547
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,240
And when will he leave?

548
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
We are doing some work.

549
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,000
What kind of work?

550
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,560
<i>What I demand</i>

551
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,280
are the map and those customs records.

552
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,280
Go to Pansaeng's house
and bring them to me.

553
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,640
What are you doing here?

554
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,480
A ghost!

555
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,000
I am not a ghost…

556
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,280
Is that truly human?

557
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,600
If you wish to know,
then cut it with a sword!

558
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,480
Here they come.

559
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,320
They are here to take the map
as Khun Saengplarn foresees.

560
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,120
Let us go.

561
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,880
What is this smoke?

562
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,880
Where did it come from, Va?

563
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Cover your nose. Cover it.

564
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,800
‪No. No.

565
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,560
Who are you?

566
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,440
Why do you look familiar?

567
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,560
You…

568
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,720
What?!

569
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,280
Enough sparring for today. Retreat!

570
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,720
Victory! Victory!

571
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,800
They surrender!

572
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,800
Why did they retreat so easily?

573
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,280
Darn it. We must hurry
to the prayer hall. Go!

574
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Saiyud!

575
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,320
My Lady!

576
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,240
My Lady.

577
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,800
- My Lady.
- Saiyud.

578
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,560
The map
and the Dharmachakra records are gone.

579
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,720
They have fooled us.

580
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,440
- My Lady.
- Saiyud.

581
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,240
My Lady.

582
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,040
Well done, Harn.

583
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,840
Will you cease your doubts
in me now, My Lord?

584
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,040
Yes. I shall manage your transfer
to my force tomorrow.

585
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,000
What of the plan
to raid Prai's camp, My Lord?

586
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,440
Prai possesses illusion magic.

587
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,920
My men could not find them at all.

588
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,680
If we bring more men to raid them,

589
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,680
we may get caught in their trap.

590
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,920
You never intended
to aid me in my revenge.

591
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,480
Do not be hasty.

592
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
They shall soon raid the capital
to help Pansaeng, his brother.

593
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,320
We shall only wait
to strike them in the city.

594
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,800
That is a better plan.

595
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,840
When the time comes,

596
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,360
you must let me slash Prai's heart myself.

597
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,040
Very well. No one shall take that chance
from you. You have my word.

598
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,920
CUSTOMS RECORD

599
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,600
These are only filthy tactics
of Jaokhun Singh.

600
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,000
They never meant anything,

601
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,680
and they shall do nothing to us.

602
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,840
Burn them.

603
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,880
Wait.

604
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,880
Let me take a look.

605
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,760
Please do, My Lord.

606
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,160
What?

607
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,600
How could this be?!

608
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,680
These are blank as well!

609
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,880
Did you fool us?!

610
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,320
Khun Saengplarn moved
the originals to a safe place days ago.

611
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,240
Is that place truly secure?

612
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,520
All customs officers

613
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,360
spent years keeping those records.

614
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,280
If they are lost,

615
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,240
we shall no longer have any evidence
to prosecute the wicked nobles.

616
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,200
You can trust him, Jom.

617
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,280
The records and the map
of the corrupt are in the palace

618
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,960
guarded by Jaokhun Kaew's men.

619
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,640
It is the safest place.

620
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,680
Then we are relieved, My Lady.

621
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,000
Are you saying

622
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,280
that we have been fighting
tooth and nail last night

623
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,120
to protect blank copies?

624
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,240
- Hm.
- Hm?

625
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,200
This is Khun Saengplarn.

626
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,800
He tricks even his closest ones.

627
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,520
How dare you deceive me?

628
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,640
Are you serving him
while posing as one of us?

629
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,520
No, sir. No.

630
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,040
I am fortunate enough
that you are not among our ranks yet.

631
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,000
I cannot return again.

632
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,280
Lady Chavala
seemed to recognize me that night.

633
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,880
That is not my problem.

634
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,560
Khun Pakdee.

635
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,040
I beg you, sir.

636
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,200
Please give me another chance.

637
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,320
Trample him!

638
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,480
Let him remember

639
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,440
not to fail again.

640
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,560
Harder!

641
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,040
Harn. What happened to your face?

642
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,320
Master Nandha.

643
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,000
Greetings.

644
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,920
Medicine to treat internal wounds.
Boil them for him.

645
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,040
You truly are our angel.
You have medicine for everyone of us.

646
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,880
Do you see, Harn?

647
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,080
Her medicine truly improved
Grandmother's appetite.

648
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,160
I will boil them for you.

649
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,800
You have my thanks, Master.

650
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,480
Have you been punished by them?

651
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,200
What did you say?

652
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,400
When we cannot deal
with the guilt ourselves,

653
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,920
for it is too heavy,

654
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,080
we will project it to someone

655
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,400
and be vengeful towards them

656
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,240
to ease our pain.

657
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,680
I do not understand what you say.

658
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,720
It is foolish for us humans

659
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,560
to attempt to control everything

660
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,720
that is not ours to control.

661
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,360
Even birth, fragility,
injuries, and mortality.

662
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,440
What transpired was not your doing,

663
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
and you need not blame yourself.

664
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,440
I…

665
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,520
May Charma lead you

666
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,200
back on the path of righteousness.

667
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,240
This morning,

668
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,160
the sun was truly beautiful.

669
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,760
It shone a hint of pink

670
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,280
above the north bend of the watercourse.

671
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,240
I think of…

672
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,520
I think of someone
who has been there with me so much.

673
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,200
Well.

674
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,800
It shall not be long, dear.

675
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,040
We shall see it together in no time.

676
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,360
Please wait for me.

677
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,240
Yes.

678
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,560
I will wait.

679
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,640
Do you know?

680
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,400
My happiest times

681
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,760
are the mornings we share,
seeing Ayothaya together.

682
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,320
So are mine.

683
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,240
Ayothaya

684
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,880
and my dear wife

685
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,440
truly strengthen my power of love.

686
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,800
But you cannot

687
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,320
visit every day as you have been.

688
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,560
You could become unwell.

689
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,880
This place is sweltering and filthy.

690
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,800
Hm?

691
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,720
Both of my hearts

692
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,840
are in here.

693
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,240
Even with the breeze outside,

694
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,520
my heart is still burning.

695
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,280
Chai is not recovering.

696
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,040
And you.

697
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,880
As if a fatal curse is not severe enough,

698
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,640
your little time left

699
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,760
must be spent here.

700
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,240
Va.

701
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,440
No need to weep over farewells

702
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
when we have truly done our best.

703
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,240
Listen to my words.

704
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,920
Muen Vorachai…

705
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,000
may not last beyond three days.

706
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,680
No. Tell me it is not true, dear.

707
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,440
- Va…
- Dear.

708
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,640
Chai.

709
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,440
Va…

710
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,760
Dear, tell me it is not true…

711
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,840
Easy…

712
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,800
Chai is leaving me…

713
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,080
Kill him

714
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,280
<i>with this consecrated knife</i>
<i>from Master Taen.</i>

715
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,000
The royal archive is ablaze.

716
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,480
The original Dharmachakra records.

717
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,840
<i>I cannot lose the key evidence.</i>

718
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,680
Va!

719
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,840
- My Lady!
- Va!

720
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,600
I should be dying, not her!

721
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,000
- Sir! Do not approach!
- Sir, no!

722
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,760
Va!

723
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,680
Charge!

724
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,520
Go!

725
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,760
Seal the city gates on every side.

726
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,400
