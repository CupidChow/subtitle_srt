1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,480
What are you lot looking at?
This is Lady Pimpilai,

2
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>the daughter of the Minister.</i>

3
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Is this a military camp
or a den of thieves?

4
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,000
Stop right there.

5
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,280
No one shall lay hands upon my people.

6
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
<i>Mong, Mong ,Teng, Mong!</i>

7
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,720
Are you this serious, dear?

8
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,360
I am serious, because

9
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
I shall come live here as well.

10
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
Khun Phra!

11
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,560
Spicy boiled egg salad
with pickled garlic.

12
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,520
This food shall help us
be excited tonight.

13
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,920
What did she mean by excited?

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Please take a bath with me, dear.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,080
Harder!

16
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,320
If the raft house shakes this much,

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,920
they must not be pretending.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
I hereby cast this curse

19
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,840
upon you and him,

20
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,120
that one day,
you shall both suffer in love as I do!

21
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,000
I have matched you with a man

22
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,600
so that you may help me.

23
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,560
But you brought
your husband here to kill me!

24
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,440
You keep blaming others.

25
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Have you ever thought of what
you did to the servants and me?

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,280
Here. Have more of these.

27
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
Va. My Lady.

28
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
Lady Pim has returned home.

29
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Is that true, Laor?

30
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,040
It is. She has moved
all her belongings out of the house.

31
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,920
Laor and I shall tidy up this place, dear.

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Well,

33
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,560
you need not hasten.

34
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Perhaps I shall be sleeping here no more.

35
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
I shall go into the woods
to practice asceticism.

36
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,400
I am to leave once
I have gathered my belongings.

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,360
Dear.

38
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Once you return from the woods,

39
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,120
shall you stay here again?

40
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,400
Perhaps not.

41
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,160
I shall reside at the camp.

42
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,600
I returned here
to convince Lady Pim to leave.

43
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
And the deed is done.

44
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,480
Very well.

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
I shall

46
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
do my best to care for this house.

47
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
Hm.

48
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Sir!

49
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,040
Do you find me so repugnant

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
that you would forsake this place?

51
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
Please do not
hurt me again, sir. I am afraid.

52
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
You are ever in my thoughts.

53
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,600
I am lonely.

54
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,720
Saiyud. Shall you embrace me?

55
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
I truly love you.

56
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
- Sir…
- Saiyud.

57
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
You know nothing of love!

58
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,560
What you are forcing upon me is lust!

59
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,000
Is it not the same thing?!

60
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
No, sir!

61
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
If it is truly love,

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
you would stop

63
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
when I told you to stop.

64
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,040
But if it is lust,

65
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,440
would you stop, sir?!

66
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,720
I care not for such things.
I shall have you, Saiyud.

67
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
Let go of me, sir!

68
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,760
If you keep violating me,
Khun Saengplarn's magic

69
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,680
shall make you suffer!

70
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,120
Pansaeng!

71
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,960
Is this not pleasure?!

72
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,360
Why would you torture me for this?!

73
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
Please let me go.

74
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
Please spare me from more suffering.

75
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,160
I can serve you no more.

76
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Saiyud…

77
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED
WE SHALL HOLD THE POWER OF THIS NATION

78
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,600
<i>What is Prai's intent</i>

79
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,040
<i>in assembling all the thieves and bandits?</i>

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Luang Bovorntat is amassing arms
for the insurrection.

81
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Both thieves and traitors

82
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
are closing in upon Ayothaya.

83
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,840
I shall not be weakened by a woman.

84
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,120
No.

85
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
What are you doing, Saiyud?

86
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,640
I can smell the fragrance from the river.

87
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
It is Lady Va's perfume.

88
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,760
She made it for me long ago,

89
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,960
but I have never used it,
since there were wounds all over.

90
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,280
You need not serve
Muen Vorachai at night any longer?

91
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Yes. There shall be no pain,

92
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
and I shall be clean.

93
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
This is most pleasant.

94
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Clean…

95
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,200
and fragrant as well.

96
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
Here. I shall help you.

97
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,800
- Aon!
- What are you doing with my woman, Aon?!

98
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,760
Saiyud is mine.

99
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,720
How dare you lay hands
upon your master's woman?

100
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,280
You bastard!

101
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,080
- Ngiam!
- Yes, sir!

102
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Punish him!

103
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,400
And you! You have refused to lie with me!

104
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,240
But you let Aon touch you.

105
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,520
You shall die. Ngiam.

106
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
Stab him with a knife.

107
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
Must we take his life, sir?

108
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
If you kill him,

109
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
I shall give you ten hun of gold.

110
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,720
I shall hold you to your word.

111
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
Yes!

112
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
Die, Aon!

113
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,320
Careful, Aon!

114
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
Aon!

115
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,680
Argh!

116
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
Aon!

117
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
Aon.

118
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
Aon! You!

119
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,480
Aon, run! Aon! Go!

120
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,600
You vile servant!

121
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,120
You both have betrayed me!

122
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,280
Do not ever show your faces here again!

123
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
Quick!

124
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
You must flee.

125
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,960
Ngiam is injured, and Muen Vorachai
shall call for the judge to arrest you.

126
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,560
And what of you?

127
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,280
He can do me no harm.

128
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,320
But you are the one he has long disdained.

129
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
When Ngiam is wounded,

130
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
he shall seize the chance
to get rid of you. Go!

131
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,560
But where should I go?

132
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,400
To Khun Saengplarn's house.
Tell this to Lady Va. Do you understand?

133
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
- Go.
- Saiyud.

134
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
- Saiyud.
- Go. Go!

135
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,960
Worry not about me. Go!

136
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Go.

137
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
He cannot harm others,

138
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,080
so he made Ngiam do it?

139
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,000
Aon. Wait here.

140
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
I shall talk to Chai.

141
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
- My Lady. My Lady!
- Va! Please wait.

142
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,160
- Va!
- Laor!

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I should not have panicked.

144
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
Now everyone is troubled.

145
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,640
Jerm! Not so tight! It hurts!

146
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,560
Fine.

147
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
What are you screaming for?!

148
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,920
It is but a small wound.

149
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Here you are, wicked sister.

150
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,640
You are the one who made Aon so insolent.

151
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,120
And who do you think started it?

152
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,800
I shall report this to the judge.

153
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,400
This servant shall not be in my place!

154
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,160
Good! We shall go together.

155
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,040
I shall reveal all the atrocities
you inflicted upon each of the servants!

156
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,520
Very well! We shall stand
before the judge together.

157
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
I shall not stop

158
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
until I put him in prison!

159
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,120
Saiyud. Jerm. Noi.

160
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,120
All of you. Go and be my witnesses.

161
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,400
I care about my parents'
reputation no longer.

162
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,960
I shall tell

163
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,880
of every wound they have endured.

164
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,160
All of you, brothers and sisters, listen.

165
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,000
Khun Saengplarn
is now willing to protect us.

166
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
You need not fear.

167
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Laor! What are you saying?!

168
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,560
My apologies, sir.

169
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,800
I shall be

170
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,320
a witness for Lady Va.

171
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
Saiyud!

172
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,400
Aon is a good man
who has always helped us.

173
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Shall you all be at peace
with him being imprisoned?

174
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,320
I shall be her witness.

175
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
Noi!

176
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,200
Lady Va and Laor
do not live in this house,

177
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,680
but we do.

178
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
Muen Vorachai cannot hurt us,
but he can make Ngiam or others do it.

179
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,520
I am pregnant.

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,960
I don't want our child

181
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,240
to suffer the way we did.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,720
Someone must stop him.

183
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
You peasants! How ungrateful!

184
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,840
I am your master!

185
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,960
I am the one

186
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
who owns every morsel you eat!

187
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
You lot shall not do this to me!

188
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
We shall continue to respect you

189
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,960
and be your servants
for the rest of our lives.

190
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,960
But Ngiam does not suffer a fatal wound.

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,840
Please do not punish Aon.

192
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,520
But he is your paramour!

193
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
Why must I stand down?!

194
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,800
No, sir.

195
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
You are the only man I shall be with.

196
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,600
Chavala.

197
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
You wicked sister.

198
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,520
I shall let you go this time.

199
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,880
But Aon

200
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
must stay away from me.

201
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,400
He has always been
the one to challenge me.

202
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,520
This time,

203
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,680
he aimed to take my woman.

204
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,480
I shall keep him no longer!
He can go die wherever he wants.

205
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,200
Very well. It is settled, brother.

206
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,440
Ngiam.

207
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,920
Yes, My Lady?

208
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,880
From now on, do not ever let Chai
hurt anyone ever again.

209
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,920
And do not commit the deeds for him,

210
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,920
or you shall be affected
by Khun Saengplarn's magic!

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,960
I have warned you.

212
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,360
Chavala! How audacious!

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,960
You have no authority
to command my people!

214
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,280
You madwoman!

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
You wicked sister!

216
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,560
The premature deaths
of young men often come from

217
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,720
impulsiveness.

218
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,360
They fight to death over a few words.

219
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,119
Today, I shall teach you about calmness

220
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,760
and also patience.

221
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,839
Together, shout "patience" 50 times!

222
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,960
- Patience!
- Patience!

223
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,440
- Patience!
- Patience!

224
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,440
- Yong.
- Hm?

225
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Look.

226
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,000
His eyes sparkled.

227
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
They have not seen each other for days.

228
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
Muen Vorachai ordered someone to harm Aon?

229
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,080
Yes. Then, Aon slashed Ngiam in the arm.

230
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,640
Chai was furious
and would not forgive him.

231
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
Now,

232
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,000
Aon has already come to our house.

233
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,280
So, I am here to ask your permission

234
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
to let Aon stay in your house.
Shall you allow him?

235
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,520
Are you asking that
a manservant reside in my home?

236
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
- Patience!
- Patience!

237
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,880
- Patience!
- Patience!

238
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,520
- Patience!
- Patience!

239
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,960
- Patience!
- Patience!

240
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,560
I am well aware
that you value your solitude.

241
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,240
Well, shall you let Aon stay
in the raft house

242
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,120
and tend to your crops in the field

243
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
as payment for his food and bed?

244
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,640
- It is the first time you are here.
- Yes.

245
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,200
You have never been to this camp.

246
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,080
And now you ask that a man
take residence in my home?

247
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,080
Well, dear.

248
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,120
He is not just any man.
He was raised alongside me.

249
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,360
- Patience!
- Patience!

250
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,080
- Patience!
- Patience!

251
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,080
Hey!

252
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,360
Will you cease your shouting?!

253
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,000
Forgive us, sir.

254
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,680
Carry on running!

255
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,080
Well…

256
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,440
Shall your answer

257
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,200
be yes or no?

258
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Please, dear.

259
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,320
All right, fine. Fine!

260
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,400
Let him stay if he so wishes!

261
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,960
I am a generous soul after all!

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
True.

263
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,280
- Patience! Patience!
- You have my thanks.

264
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,400
- Patience!
- Patience!

265
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,720
- Patience!
- Patience!

266
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,400
Your meal, sir.

267
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,840
What is this food?!

268
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,280
This tastes awful!

269
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,760
You can ask Noi
to cook for you as before, sir.

270
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
I do not know how to cook.

271
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,560
How could I?
They have all taken Chavala's side.

272
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,360
They can poison my food at any time.

273
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
My clothes

274
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,200
and belongings
shall be attended to by none but you.

275
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,480
Do not ever let them touch any of it.

276
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,120
Sir! Then I must do all the labor!

277
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,080
Sir. Shall we try this?

278
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,200
I heard that there is one shaman
residing in Pa Muang.

279
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,280
Would you seek the shaman's help
in lifting this curse?

280
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,760
A shaman?

281
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,800
Well,

282
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,560
what aid do you seek from him?

283
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,920
I am Muen Vorachai.

284
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,240
I have more wealth to recompense
Master Saenkam than anyone here.

285
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,120
Master. He is a nobleman.

286
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
A buffalo hide, cursed within the stomach?

287
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,800
Such condemned sorcery.

288
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,520
It shall not be difficult to remove.

289
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,400
Lie down.

290
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,160
Wait.

291
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,600
You are from the town afar.

292
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,000
No one knows who you truly are.

293
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,160
But I am a civil servant of high rank.

294
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,840
If you decide to play tricks

295
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,160
to humiliate me

296
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
or hurt me,

297
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,880
I shall hold you accountable.

298
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,120
Lie down.

299
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,920
It is real, sir. You shall be healed.

300
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,320
Who cast this magic upon you?

301
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,160
Their craft is most uncommon!

302
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,120
Drink.

303
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
Muen Vorachai! Sir!

304
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,840
I shall not yield.

305
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Sir! Sir.

306
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Master.

307
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,360
What did you do?!

308
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,200
This is even more painful!

309
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,280
I did not succeed!

310
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,760
His magic is more powerful than mine!

311
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Sir!

312
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,320
Was it Taen Seenil?

313
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,280
You did not succeed?

314
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,480
Can no one do anything to him?!

315
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Blast it!

316
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,160
What is his name?!

317
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,600
Khun Saengplarn.

318
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,120
My master shall rid you of your foe.

319
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,040
Who is your master?

320
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,800
Where is he?

321
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,560
I do not know.
I have not seen him in a long time.

322
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,320
But there is one nobleman

323
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
named…

324
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,240
Bovorn…

325
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,800
Bovorn what?!

326
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,440
Luang Bovorntat!

327
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,640
Yes, yes! It is him!

328
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,720
Take me to that nobleman.

329
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,640
Should the enemy

330
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
advance from this path,
where would you station your guard?

331
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,880
- Here, sir.
- Good.

332
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,320
And what

333
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,040
- of our offense--
- Sir.

334
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,720
Va told me to deliver your meal.

335
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,080
And Ming, share this among your fellows.

336
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,640
Thank you.

337
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,200
Give my thanks to your lady.

338
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,320
Yes, sir.

339
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,480
And how fare you all

340
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
at the house?

341
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,160
We are living well, sir.

342
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,120
Living well?

343
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,480
Laor.

344
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,800
How is the new servant, Aon?

345
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,520
Aon is attending
to the rice crops in your field, sir.

346
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,000
Attending to the rice crops…

347
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,760
Does that mean he rarely sees Lady Va?

348
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,640
Well,

349
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,640
- he sometimes--
- Oh, I am starving!

350
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,160
Is this mine, Laor?

351
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,000
- Can I have it now?
- Yes.

352
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,040
Move.

353
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,480
Well, Laor?

354
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,520
Does Aon see Lady Va often?

355
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
There is chili paste as well!

356
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,040
What kind of chili paste?

357
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,520
- It is--
- Laor.

358
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
Answer me first.

359
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,240
He has just completed planting the rice.

360
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,760
I heard he will tend
to the backyard field next.

361
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,760
They must be planning together.

362
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
Planning together? Does that mean

363
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,440
Aon is alone with Lady Va?

364
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,680
Aon and--

365
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,920
This is delicious, Laor!

366
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,720
But cucumbers are missing.

367
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,280
Can you pick some for me near the kitchen?

368
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
- Yes.
- Wait, Laor.

369
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,840
Answer me first.

370
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,480
They are beside the kitchen fence.

371
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,720
Yong!

372
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,920
If you want cucumbers,
go pick them yourself.

373
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,880
Or I shall stuff my foot
in your mouth instead!

374
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
I am waiting for her answers.

375
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,240
Well, Laor.

376
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,720
What was the question again, sir?

377
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
- Are Aon and Lady Va
- Are Aon and Lady Va

378
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
- alone together?
- alone together?

379
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,920
Yes, sir.

380
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,120
Khun Saengplarn
devoted himself to helping us.

381
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
He truly is a good man.

382
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,520
He must hold
great affection for you, My Lady.

383
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,200
Aon. We have decided
to be together as siblings.

384
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
He is my new brother.

385
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,280
- Siblings?
- Yes.

386
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,480
But you and he were wed to one another.

387
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,040
Aon. Khun Saengplarn seems…

388
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,240
not to be drawn to women.

389
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,520
Does Khun Saengplarn

390
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
find favor

391
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
with those of his own sex?

392
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,240
I do not know.

393
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,440
But I often heard him speak

394
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,480
of being unable to be with women.

395
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,560
This is unfortunate.

396
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,320
You shall not be able
to marry anyone else.

397
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,920
Will you be bound
to live without a spouse?

398
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,160
Do we truly need a spouse?

399
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,960
We can have them

400
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,600
or be without them.

401
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,840
Yet, we need love.

402
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,200
Is there someone who comes to mind first

403
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,400
when you wake up?

404
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,320
Someone who makes our day start fresh.

405
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,720
Someone

406
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
who keeps us from going back to sleep.

407
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,920
For me, it is you, Aon.

408
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,120
You and our brothers
and sisters at the house

409
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,200
are the ones
I shall care for in my parents' stead.

410
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,480
Every day, I wake up worrying
if you all are harmed.

411
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,520
Thank you, My Lady.

412
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,880
Dear!

413
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,560
When did you come back?

414
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,400
I thought it was a thief.

415
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,639
There is no tub for a soaking ritual
at the camp, so I had to come.

416
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,920
You should not have scared me.

417
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,400
I am all soaked.

418
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,360
And this water…

419
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,159
Can a woman soak in it?

420
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,920
Women are not to be viewed with disgust.

421
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,360
On the contrary,

422
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,280
they are embodiments of beauty.

423
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,280
Their beauty may be most frightening.

424
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,320
Did I upset you?

425
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,320
I am not inclined to seek favor
with those of my own gender.

426
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,360
I am a man…

427
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,960
drawn to women.

428
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,040
Saiyud! No, do not scream.

429
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,400
- It is me.
- You scared me.

430
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,040
What are you doing here?
Muen Vorachai may find you.

431
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,280
I brought something for you.

432
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,320
I found it around Khun Saengplarn's house.

433
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,440
You were the first thought
in my mind upon waking.

434
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,280
I came here immediately
after retrieving it.

435
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,240
Now, you shall have this for your skin.

436
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,520
And did you ask for his permission?

437
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,720
First thought in my mind upon waking?

438
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,280
Is there someone who comes to mind first

439
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,400
when you wake up?

440
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,240
Well? You must honor
the master of the house.

441
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
He is always
at the military camp for a month.

442
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,440
I still have not met him.

443
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,600
This honey

444
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,280
must be able to cure some of your scars.

445
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Thank you for thinking of me.

446
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,240
This house

447
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,880
is more comfortable
than the camp, is it not?

448
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
Yes.

449
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Knowing you spent the night here,

450
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,560
my first thought upon waking

451
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,280
was of what food you might wish to have.

452
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,920
First thought upon waking?

453
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,880
Sir.

454
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,040
Hm?

455
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,880
About…

456
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,480
finding favor in men,

457
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,400
did you overhear the conversation?

458
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Please forgive me.

459
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,400
I did not mean it as an insult.

460
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,560
No, no. It is me who owe you an apology.

461
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
Last night,

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,640
I let my anger consume me.

463
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,640
But I am particularly joyful today.

464
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,560
It is all because of a tiny smile

465
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,440
and a few words

466
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,040
from a certain someone.

467
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,200
A certain someone?

468
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
Who is it that you are talking about?

469
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,480
Sir!

470
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,880
To see Luang Bovorntat?

471
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,840
Are you a hermit?

472
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,760
What is your name?

473
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,360
He is Master Saenkam, sir.

474
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,440
Tell your master

475
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,960
that if he wishes
to succeed in his mission,

476
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,400
he needs someone powerful.

477
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,080
And I am that someone.

478
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,760
He is not available. Leave at once.

479
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,800
Khun Pakdee! Sir!

480
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,040
Please wait, sir.

481
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,360
I have studied
under the same master as yours!

482
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,480
You must welcome me properly!

483
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,360
You claimed

484
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,880
that I too was a pupil of your master.

485
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,000
What did you mean by it?

486
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,440
Master Taen Seenil,

487
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,640
the greatest sorcerer of this land,

488
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,200
is our master.

489
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,160
Are you familiar with Master Taen?

490
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,440
When he was a forest bandit,

491
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,120
I did raid alongside him

492
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,400
and learned the magic from him.

493
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,760
Die!

494
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,640
Our master was once a forest bandit?

495
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,560
He was but a servant child
who was tired of poverty.

496
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,240
Oppressed by those of higher status,

497
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,560
he resolved to master the art of sorcery.

498
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,800
One day,

499
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,600
he left all of us.

500
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,160
I thought he was becoming
a nobleman in one of the cities.

501
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,640
He is not a nobleman in Ayothaya.

502
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,640
For the last ten years,
there are no new nobles in Ayothaya

503
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
because Ayothaya

504
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,360
is being administered
by the six families of nobles.

505
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,520
What are they discussing?

506
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,120
Why am I not invited?

507
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,840
One night, I was residing
in the woods near Ayothaya

508
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,160
and searched for him through my mind.

509
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,120
Then, he responded for the first time

510
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,560
and said your name,

511
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,880
"Bovorntat."

512
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,160
Master Taen stated my name?

513
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,120
Yes.

514
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,600
Is he here with you, Luang Bovorntat?

515
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,920
Where is he?

516
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,600
No one knows where his physical body is.

517
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,880
He never showed himself to me in person.

518
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Each time we contacted,
he appeared in a spiritual form.

519
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,760
You need not know

520
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,320
where I am.

521
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,440
Master.

522
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,960
At last, I behold you once more!

523
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,160
Saenkam.

524
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,600
You are much more skilled.

525
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,880
Now,

526
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,000
you are worthy of greatness
alongside Taen Seenil.

527
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,000
For ten years, I have longed.

528
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,360
I am sworn
to serve you until my last breath.

529
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,880
Please let me remain
at your side as I once did, Master.

530
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,440
Muen Vorachai, who is outside now.

531
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,600
If you are to remove
the buffalo hide from him,

532
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,440
Pansaeng shall notice.

533
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,160
Why would you alert him of your presence?

534
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,200
I shall deal with this matter myself.

535
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,400
What is this magic, Master?

536
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,960
Have you mastered the Asoraveda,

537
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,160
the highest form of magic?

538
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,720
Luang Bovorntat.

539
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,960
Why did you speak so at length?

540
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,160
I shall rid you of the curse.

541
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,720
Are you able
to wield magic as well, My Lord?

542
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,440
This yantra
shall suppress Pansaeng's curse.

543
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,360
From now,

544
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,040
that buffalo hide
shall not pain you again.

545
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,800
Is it true, My Lord?

546
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,920
I shall feel pain no more?

547
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,160
From now on,

548
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,640
he shall not be able
to harm me again, shall he?

549
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,520
You are truly most excellent.

550
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,960
Are you the master of Master Saenkam?

551
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,880
Do not speak of this to anyone.

552
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,160
And you

553
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,480
must pretend to be good
and enter Pansaeng's house.

554
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,640
Must I pretend

555
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,720
to have changed my ways, My Lord?

556
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,240
Yes.

557
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,920
I have a task for you.

558
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,840
Aon.

559
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,880
Khun Saengplarn wishes to talk to you.

560
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,440
Sir.

561
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,040
What you did for us gave us new lives.

562
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,240
From now on,

563
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,360
I shall not do anything
to trouble you again.

564
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,280
Very well.

565
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
To live together, you shall have to work.

566
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,240
I am here to talk about this.

567
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,680
I have planted all the rice crops, sir.

568
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,920
I am now tidying up this garden.

569
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,040
You can leave it there.

570
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,840
I shall have my soldiers attend to it.

571
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,320
Then, I saw a little leak in the roof.

572
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,480
Shall you let me mend it?

573
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,520
No.

574
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,360
The soldiers shall mend it.

575
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
Then, what shall you let Aon do?

576
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,000
He shall sell goods in the market.

577
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,240
You have sold something before,
have you not?

578
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,080
I have, sir. I can do it.

579
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,040
I shall make money for you, sir.

580
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,800
Are the people
of your household not struggling?

581
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,640
Share the money you make with them.

582
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,280
I shall serve you

583
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,920
until the day I die, sir.

584
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,040
Good.

585
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,960
I shall rent a shop for you.

586
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,000
Sir. You shall rent a shop?

587
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,200
Yes.

588
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,320
Only a stall should be enough.

589
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,000
A shop is better.

590
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,920
That way, you shall have a place to sleep

591
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,120
and do not have to return here every day.

592
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,880
Yes, sir.

593
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,320
Come. I shall help you.

594
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,160
Thank you, sir.

595
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,680
I shall hold it.

596
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,640
Yes, sir.

597
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,560
Please, Lady Va.

598
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,520
It shall not look good.
A disrespect to your honor.

599
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,560
You should walk ahead.

600
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,240
Lady Va.

601
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
Look at those Westerners.

602
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,680
They respect women's honor.

603
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,120
They let women walk ahead of them

604
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,600
because women are more fragile.

605
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
They shall follow them
and protect them if needed.

606
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,880
I think I am fond of this idea.

607
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,280
Yes.

608
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,320
Go.

609
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,320
Let's go, Aon.

610
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,560
Wait, Aon.

611
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,600
I know, My Lady.

612
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,360
Aunt Chuea's sweets shop?

613
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,360
Yes!

614
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,800
I crave them so much.

615
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,640
Sir.

616
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,600
The sweets from this shop are delicious.

617
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,600
Aunt Chuea! Greetings.

618
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,520
- Here.
- Here, My Lady.

619
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,400
She does not like Khanom chan, sir.

620
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,280
Sampannee is her favorite.

621
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
After Sampannee,

622
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,400
she shall have Mung bean dumplings.

623
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,120
- Then, Foi thong!
- Foi thong!

624
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,720
I never understand this order.

625
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,200
She has had them
in this order since childhood.

626
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,880
It is the order of my favorites.

627
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,280
When we were young,
Father and Mother would bring us all here.

628
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,360
And we would pick what we like,
so I had to be quick as well.

629
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
Thank you.

630
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,760
Here, My Lady.

631
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,720
Is it delicious?

632
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,600
Very.

633
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,120
It is good as always, Aunt Chuea.

634
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,040
Sir.

635
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,720
Do you wish to try some?

636
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,800
No.

637
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,360
Aon.

638
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,400
It is fragrant and sweet.

639
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,200
This way, sir.

640
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,440
Here it is.

641
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,840
The shop I wish to rent.

642
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,320
Luckily,

643
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,880
it is vacant.

644
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,040
It is in a good area.

645
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,760
And it looks crowded.

646
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,680
Yes.

647
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,360
You shall have a shop now.

648
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,960
It shall help you sell well, Aon.

649
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,960
Here.

650
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,320
You have my thanks.

651
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,880
I wish you good fortune.

652
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,960
Aon.

653
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,560
- Yes, My Lady?
- Let us go see the shop.

654
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,920
- Yes, My Lady.
- Go!

655
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,200
Good, then bad. Joy, then sorrow.

656
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,160
The only thing that can cause this is…

657
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,600
GOOD, THEN BAD, JOY, THEN SORROW
THE ONLY CAUSE IS LOVE

658
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,800
We are finished with the shop now.

659
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,360
I shall greet Khiew
at her shop in the front.

660
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,040
ROOM FOR RENT

661
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,160
Well…

662
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,040
Will you be able to live here?

663
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,760
It is more than enough, sir.

664
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,520
Tomorrow, I shall go and order some goods.

665
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,720
We shall be ready to open in a few days.

666
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,920
Good.

667
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,720
Then, you can spend nights here.

668
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,280
Do not return to the house.

669
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
Yes, sir.

670
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,680
Actually…

671
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,640
Visit your house from time to time.

672
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,640
Pardon me, sir?

673
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,360
There are women
and children in your house.

674
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Return to them now and then.

675
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,760
Yes, sir.

676
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,200
And…

677
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,080
take good care of your Lady.

678
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,840
Yes, sir.

679
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,920
Dear. Khiew said that

680
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,920
there is an iron merchant
from Namphi selling goods over there.

681
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,960
- Do you wish to buy knives and swords?
- No.

682
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,120
Some people

683
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,840
can wound the hearts of others
without the need of weapons or sorcery.

684
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,080
Why would I need them?

685
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,640
Dear!

686
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,560
Did I do something wrong?

687
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,440
If you do not tell me,

688
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,200
I shall not be able to mend it.

689
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,360
I am here, sir.

690
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,920
Here.

691
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,120
Are you not coming inside, sir?

692
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,000
I shall go to the camp now.

693
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,680
Perhaps I shall not return for days.

694
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,520
Yes, sir.

695
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,920
<i>It pains me, whether she is near or far.</i>

696
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,720
<i>Now I know how it truly feels.</i>

697
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,960
Va.

698
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Why are you crying? What did happen?

699
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,920
Laor.

700
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,120
That gaze.

701
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,400
Is he so angry
and full of contempt for me?

702
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,480
Your duty

703
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,240
is to plant amoria blooms
in place of pandans.

704
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,640
You there.

705
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,080
A ghost!

706
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,360
Va. Noi has been missing for three days.

707
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,360
What happened?

708
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,040
- Noi!
- Noi!

709
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,560
- Noi!
- Noi!

710
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,520
Noi!

711
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,000
I have retrieved the belongings
of Pansaeng and Chavala.

712
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,120
This is the magical amoria bloom.

713
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,360
It shall make Pansaeng
fall deeply for Chavala.

714
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,320
<i>He shall yearn for her and desire her.</i>

715
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,360
Sir!

716
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,560
Sir.

717
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,600
