1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,720
If the spirit of Noi remains unbound,

2
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,760
we ask that you appear before us.

3
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,040
Let the unknown be known.

4
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>Let the concealed be brought to light.</i>

5
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,480
Noi!

6
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,600
I only wish for a love charm.

7
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
Might I suggest the magical plant?

8
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,360
Boil these leaves and give that tea
to your intended to drink for a few days.

9
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,520
If Master Saenkam
cursed you with a love charm,

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,760
you shall become sick.

11
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,160
Cast a love charm with a plant?

12
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
Lady Pim, stop at once!

13
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
It is all because of you
that I couldn't eat or sleep for months.

14
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
You shall die today!

15
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
This is an all-out war, sir!

16
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
- Stop!
- Stop at once!

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,480
Va, stop! All of you, stop!

18
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
Dear! Why would you hug Lady Pim?!

19
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,800
Fate is indeed cruel.

20
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,240
<i>It can confine us</i>
<i>as servants of all kinds.</i>

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,680
<i>Our bodies may be confined for any reason,</i>

22
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,200
yet our hearts shall always be free.

23
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,280
We can hold anyone in our hearts.

24
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,080
Five cases of fighting over Saenkam's
magical leaves have been reported.

25
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Four were cursed and fell ill
by Master Saenkam's magic.

26
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,480
Eight were reported to be under
a love charm from Master Saenkam's leaves.

27
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
All of that

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
in only one week,

29
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Minister of the Capital?

30
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
Yes.

31
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,440
It appears Ayothaya has no problems

32
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,600
other than its people
using magic on each other.

33
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,760
And how are we supposed

34
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,600
to investigate and judge these cases?

35
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,280
We shall only be able to record them.

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,079
For the past month,
the people of Ayothaya,

37
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,760
nobles and citizens alike,

38
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,320
have been unable to perform their duties.

39
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Their sole activity for the past month
has been begging for these magical leaves.

40
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
Are there any other reports

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
of missing female servants?

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,520
None at this time, sir.

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
Luang, I heard that your wife went
for these leaves as well, did she not?

44
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Uh, well…

45
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,960
Has your wife told you
about watering this plant with blood?

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,200
She said that chicken blood
can also be used as an offering.

47
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,200
Who would be savage enough to slaughter
a person for offerings, My Lord?

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,200
And how are these leaves
supposed to be used, My Lord?

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,040
To consume them, we can boil them as tea

50
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,600
or chew them right away.

51
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,360
I was told that they are truly magical.

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
The aspirations for advancement,

53
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,120
recuperation from ailment,
or the enchantment of affection

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,920
are all realized.

55
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,680
But it is not right

56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,080
to let people be much obsessed with
superstitions, Minister of the Capital.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes, Chief of the Armed Forces.

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
I shall dispatch patrols
for observation now and then.

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Help! Please help me!

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,680
My daughter has been raped
and violated by Master Saenkam!

61
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,640
Help me!

62
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Please help! Please help me!

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
My Lord.

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,720
The Minister of the Capital

65
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,680
is sending his force
to arrest Master Saenkam.

66
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
What is happening this time?!

67
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
Jaokhun.

68
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I wish you would let this matter go.

69
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,800
I shall teach
Master Saenkam a lesson myself.

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
The person who reported
this offense is Chum,

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,320
and she is Muen Arak's wife,
not a commoner.

72
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,720
Their daughter
has been violated and detained

73
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,760
in that house for months.

74
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,800
Do they have no shame

75
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,440
for reporting such a matter?

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,360
This way of thought

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,200
shall only encourage Saenkam
to commit these crimes.

78
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,760
He may think that the lady
and her family will be ashamed.

79
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,080
See what happens now.

80
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
He is facing the people
who do not fear to report him.

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,720
I wish to mediate with Chum myself.

82
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Please, My Lord.

83
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,520
It does not have to be a criminal case.

84
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
But this case

85
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,560
shall be watched closely
by the Chief of the Armed Forces.

86
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,320
We must pursue justice.

87
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Then, I have an offer.

88
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,240
For this rice concession from China,

89
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
I shall have you be the one to manage it.

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,600
Twenty thousand haap, My Lord.

91
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
Really?

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
Twenty thousand haap?

93
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
Yes.

94
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,320
I shall settle this matter today.

95
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,040
And for the case of Chum's daughter,

96
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,760
let us put it behind us.
Is an agreement in place, My Lord?

97
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,360
Withdraw my accusation?

98
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,320
Look at her.

99
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,920
My daughter was raped by Saenkam,

100
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,120
and she is now lying there,
lost her mind completely.

101
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,640
And you wish for me to withdraw?!

102
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,640
The authorities feel truly sorry
for you and your daughter.

103
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,120
And if there is a criminal case,
all shall be aware of this disgrace.

104
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Your daughter shall lose all her honor.

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,080
Would it not be for the best
if this issue were forgotten?

106
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,920
Let them all be aware then!
She is my daughter.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,320
I have raised and nurtured her well.
This hurts me.

108
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,720
And I shall not allow him
to hurt any other mothers.

109
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,920
I shall ensure
that he is held accountable.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
But it was you who sent your daughter
to perform the ritual with him!

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
He fooled me!

112
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
Take this.

113
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,200
A token of apology.
Master Saenkam wishes for you to have it.

114
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,240
Does the Minister of the Capital
truly refuse to pursue this case?

115
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,560
He rejected your accusation!

116
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
Master Saenkam has many
high-ranking nobles as his supporters.

117
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,040
If you do not let this go,

118
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,240
it seems that your husband

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,800
shall be a Muen forever.

120
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
Think this through.

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,440
What?

122
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,400
Being a wife of a mere Muen,
and she thought of accusing me?

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,040
She should watch herself.

124
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,480
I may send a spellbound
buffalo decoy right to her door

125
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,840
and make the mother become insane as well.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Even now, you still
have not come to your senses!

127
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,240
Raping women is a severe crime.
You must stop!

128
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,120
It is but a small matter.

129
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
Behold these two ladies.

130
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,720
They are glad to serve
Master Saenkam up close.

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
- Are you?
- Yes.

132
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,600
- Are you?
- Yes.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,640
If you did it to those who consented,

134
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,800
who would hold you accountable?!

135
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,360
But you fooled their parents into
letting you rape them! You pervert!

136
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,240
Well, well.

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,040
I heard you. You do talk a lot.

138
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,880
- Tian.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,160
Did you wash those clothes yourself?

140
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Where is Laor?

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,680
- She will not be here, sir. I have asked.
- Huh?

142
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,080
And Lady Va said to me,

143
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,920
"Tell him to have a meal at his house."

144
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,600
I have explained everything to her.
What could she not understand?

145
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,200
Your lady is getting quite bold now.

146
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,880
Let me see.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
What? They are still wet.

148
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,240
Hang them again!

149
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,520
Hooray! Hooray!

150
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,360
- Hooray!
- What is it, Tian?

151
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,000
Your loud voice scared us.

152
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Khun Saengplarn has moved
his belongings back home, My Lady!

153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,080
Hooray!

154
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,800
Dear!

155
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,560
Stop right there.

156
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
My return is only to my own home,

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,520
not to stay with you.

158
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes.

159
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,840
Only to stay in your own home.
We shall live separately. Duly noted.

160
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,800
- We are only siblings.
- Yes, only siblings.

161
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,520
I return because I do not wish
for more problems. It does not mean…

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,760
you win.

163
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,280
That is absolutely true, dear,

164
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,640
since I have always been won over.

165
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,560
I am won over
by your goodness and your charm.

166
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,240
I am also won over
by what my heart desires.

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
Quit that thought.

168
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,320
Do not go too far with your thoughts.

169
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
Do not glare at me.

170
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,880
Do not sweet talk. Do not
approach or hold me. Do not tease.

171
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,120
- No--
- Duly noted.

172
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,760
From now on, the ones who shall
take care of you in here are Tian

173
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,240
and Laor. And I shall be here
only if there are problems.

174
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
I am relieved now.

175
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,560
The painful void I have felt

176
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,240
is now gone.

177
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,600
Do you realize that

178
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,520
maybe we humans only need

179
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,800
a companionship of some kind? That is it.

180
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,440
Here is your scented candle.

181
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,920
I shall go and prepare your dinner.

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
You must be sick
of dry and tough grilled fish.

183
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
What a devious lady.

184
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,640
I shall put in my love.

185
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,600
Fine. Only goodwill.

186
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Va.

187
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,000
Khun Saengplarn
picked some flowers for you.

188
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,000
He gives you his thanks
and says that the food is delicious.

189
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
I shall pour my heart into it.

190
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
That is it.

191
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
My love charm.

192
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,280
You both live in the same house,

193
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,240
but do not meet or talk.
You only send flowers back and forth.

194
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,560
It is the first time
I've seen such a thing.

195
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,360
Your tea set is ready, sir.

196
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,280
Where does this music come from?

197
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, Lady Va is playing a khim.

198
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,480
Aon has made some profit,

199
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,000
so he redeemed the khim
that Muen Vorachai had pawned

200
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
and returned it to Lady Va.

201
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Where did the bell sounds come from?

202
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,560
Was it Master?

203
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,680
<i>To truly love is to release expectation,</i>

204
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,880
<i>transcend pain, and overcome selfishness.</i>

205
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,920
<i>Each other alone shall suffice.</i>

206
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
<i>To truly love is to release expectation,</i>

207
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,760
<i>transcend pain, and overcome selfishness.</i>

208
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
<i>Each other alone shall suffice.</i>

209
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,280
Each other alone shall suffice.

210
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,040
Are you finally here, Master?

211
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,360
There are six cases of robbery

212
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
and six physical arguments.

213
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Those are all for this week, My Lords.

214
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,760
What?

215
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
That was all?

216
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,720
I heard that someone
reported that their daughter

217
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,920
has been raped and violated by Saenkam.

218
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,760
My servants were talking
about that too, I heard.

219
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
There is no such thing.

220
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Perhaps the soldiers found out
that there is no truth to it.

221
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,880
Well, if there is no more matter at hand,

222
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,960
I recently acquired a new fighting cock,

223
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,440
and I wish to challenge

224
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,640
Lueang, your fighter, Jaokhun Thammanart.

225
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,040
Oh? Very well.

226
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,960
That was all, was it not?

227
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
Then, let us all watch my Lueang fights.

228
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,800
- Come.
- Please, My Lord.

229
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
My new fighter is not
to be underestimated, My Lord.

230
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,680
All cases related to Saenkam
have now disappeared.

231
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,280
The Minister of the Capital
looks suspicious as well.

232
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,000
I think the same, My Lord.

233
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
As for Saenkam,

234
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,600
I myself have not seen his face.

235
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,240
May I observe him,
in case there is more to this matter?

236
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,800
- Good. You can proceed.
- Yes, My Lord.

237
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,160
Master. Please help me.

238
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
If you restore
my father's ability to walk,

239
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,360
I shall give you anything you desire.

240
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,840
Cha.

241
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Yes, Master.

242
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,120
Here. Let your father drink this.

243
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,920
Get up and try to walk.

244
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,840
You need not hold him.

245
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Father.

246
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,720
My father can walk again!

247
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,560
- Oh, Master Saenkam!
- It worked!

248
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Your magic is potent! Sathu!

249
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,360
- Sathu!
- Sathu!

250
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
Your magic is truly potent, Master!

251
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,240
- Sathu! Master Saenkam!
- Sathu! Master Saenkam!

252
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,120
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

253
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,000
- Master Saenkam!
- Master Saenkam!

254
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,000
All of this

255
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,960
is merely an illusion.

256
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,880
It is only to lift your spirits.

257
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,320
Anyone can achieve this.

258
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,720
And who are you?

259
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,120
The Chief Minister sent me.

260
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,720
If any of you are troubled

261
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,520
by the schemes of this cult,

262
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,800
do not be afraid to report it to me.

263
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,280
You.

264
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,080
It is your willpower
that allows you to walk again,

265
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
not that tea.

266
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,680
But I could not stand straight before.

267
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Because you never believed you could.

268
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,240
It is in our nature

269
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,560
to not practice using our minds
to take charge of our bodies.

270
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,480
It is our human nature to believe

271
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,800
that achievements come from
the sacred power, rather than ourselves.

272
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,360
Are you here to challenge me?

273
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,800
Dark magic? Killing people?
Blood sacrifice?

274
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,720
If you wish to rely on the damned spirits,

275
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
then watch closely

276
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,920
to see how long these vengeful spirits
fulfill your wishes.

277
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,920
They shall take something in return.

278
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,880
If you do not wish to be
the victim of those spirits,

279
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,320
do not believe in this disgusting sorcery.

280
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
Do not listen to him! Chase him away.

281
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,560
Try me.

282
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,440
We are all facing hardships,

283
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,040
and we favor shortcuts.

284
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,760
But be careful, for these shortcuts
shall make everything worse.

285
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,080
Enough with this!

286
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,840
Who says you can preach in my abode?!

287
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,280
Your power…

288
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,400
You are Taen Seenil's disciple.

289
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,000
- No! No!
- Mother!

290
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,640
You…

291
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,360
You have robbed my family!

292
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,760
Who are you?

293
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,480
My name is Khun Saengplarn!

294
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,280
My parents and my sister
were killed by your kind!

295
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,760
You are under
the effect of the amoria bloom.

296
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,800
You cannot defeat me.
Your obsession with a woman weakened you.

297
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,480
You scum killed my parents

298
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,720
and my sister.

299
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,720
Night after night,
I lay in wait to kill you.

300
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,400
But if I do,

301
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,480
I would become a monster like you!

302
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,760
I shall give you

303
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,000
and Taen Seenil
a chance to change your ways.

304
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,280
If not, I shall take off my uniform,

305
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,840
discard the image of a good man,
and draw your blood out

306
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,600
to worship my parents and my sister!

307
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,600
Dear.

308
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,960
The never-ending nightmare.

309
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,440
The lasting vengeance.

310
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
Please help me.

311
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,600
Time has swept the past away.

312
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,320
It has ended.

313
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,440
This place

314
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,640
is your present.

315
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,200
Please see it as it is.

316
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,600
Never in my life have I
been treated with such disrespect!

317
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,560
Pansaeng, I will kill you!

318
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,680
I shall kill you with my own hands!

319
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,840
Even after you lost to him?

320
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,680
Did you not say he is weak?

321
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,960
Why could you not defeat him then?

322
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,840
You truly are dense.

323
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,080
I said that we must wait!

324
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,120
His strength will diminish with time.

325
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,000
The tea from amoria bloom
he drinks every day

326
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
shall slowly take effect!

327
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,960
Three months from now,

328
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,600
if he has not died, you are incompetent!

329
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,640
If we are to work together,

330
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,920
we may be able to get rid of him
without waiting three months.

331
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
How?

332
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,840
Master Seenil

333
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,280
has written the yantra for the magic trap.

334
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,800
If we can lure him into this trap

335
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,360
and strike him at the same time,

336
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
he shall not survive.

337
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,240
Why are you coming here yourself today?

338
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
- How did you know it was me?
- Hm.

339
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,080
Your perfume is truly stuck in my mind.

340
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
Dear.

341
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,600
I have something to ask you.

342
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,400
Well, Songkran is only three days away.

343
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,800
It's a tradition in my house to perform
merit-making for my parents' remains.

344
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,040
And do you wish to dedicate merits

345
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,719
to your family's remains as well?

346
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,639
I have moved all of them to Wat Chedi.

347
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,800
It is the same temple as mine.

348
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,840
Then,

349
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,159
I shall prepare two sets
of food offerings and robes

350
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,480
for my parents

351
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,120
and your parents.

352
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,840
Hm. Very well.

353
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Thank you very much.

354
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,040
Yes.

355
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,960
Dear.

356
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,600
Would you be glad

357
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,480
to pay respect to my parents?

358
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,600
I wish to introduce you to them.

359
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes.

360
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,960
Very well.

361
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,080
Uh, you…

362
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
should pay respect to my parents as well.

363
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,480
Certainly.

364
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,720
It has been years since you last came.

365
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,320
I am glad you came.

366
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,160
I have truly changed my ways.

367
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,240
Then, we should take an oath
to make Father and Mother proud.

368
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,360
What oath?

369
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Brother.

370
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,040
It is not really necessary.

371
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
We should do it, Chai.

372
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,240
That way, we shall relive our memories
when they are still around.

373
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,720
I shall be a good person,

374
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
putting the welfare of others

375
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
before my own.

376
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,840
I shall be a good person,

377
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,800
putting the welfare of others

378
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,000
before my own.

379
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
I shall be the servant of this land

380
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,320
and uphold the well-being of its people.

381
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,440
I shall be the servant of this land

382
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,040
and uphold the well-being of its people.

383
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,720
Father, Mother,

384
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
we both

385
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,040
still hold your teachings in our hearts.

386
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,360
Va.

387
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,680
Dear.

388
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,720
Sir.

389
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,680
This way.

390
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,360
Father, Mother,

391
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,160
this is Pansaeng,

392
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,760
or Khun Saengplarn,

393
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,360
the one I am wedded to.

394
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,280
KRAI, IN, PHUENG

395
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,840
The three of them are now together.
Father, Mother, and my sister, Phueng.

396
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
- Dear.
- Hm?

397
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,120
What were you like when you were a child?

398
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,680
I was a very good and well-behaved child.

399
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
And how would Phueng describe you?

400
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,880
Ah.

401
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,960
I was very mischievous,

402
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,600
and I teased her all the time.

403
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,400
The teasing was not
because of being troublesome

404
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,480
but because I liked
being with her all the time.

405
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,960
Dear.

406
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
What is it that you wish for?

407
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,960
What is yours?

408
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,680
I wish to be reborn
to meet you in every life

409
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,760
and for us to always remember each other.

410
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,800
Now, what is yours?

411
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,200
What did you wish for?

412
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,520
I am not telling you.

413
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,640
What? You…

414
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,640
I shall tell you next time.

415
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,160
Are you truly not telling me?

416
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,360
I am not.

417
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,640
Dear. Please tell me.

418
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
- No.
- Dear.

419
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,120
Khun Saengplarn!

420
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,000
Please help us, sir.

421
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,320
My daughter has been held captive.

422
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,320
Va.

423
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,840
Wait for me in this temple
and do not go anywhere. I shall return.

424
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,600
Yes.

425
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,000
Lead the way.

426
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,320
This way, sir.

427
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,520
This way, sir.

428
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,760
I do not hear the scream anymore.

429
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,640
Master Saenkam has helped us

430
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,760
while the officials
such as yourself did nothing!

431
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,760
Yet you dared hurt a good man like him!

432
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,920
- What is this?
- Run.

433
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,040
You!

434
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,680
Luang Bovorntat.

435
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,280
Saenkam!

436
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,800
This yantra from Master Taen Seenil

437
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,240
is all powerful.

438
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,840
You shall not survive this time!

439
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,480
You will die, Pansaeng.

440
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,200
The amoria bloom you drank every day
made you obsessed with your woman.

441
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,320
Your magic has faded now.

442
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,160
<i>Master, please forgive me.</i>

443
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,200
<i>Please restore my magic</i>

444
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,760
<i>and help me survive this tenure.</i>

445
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,880
<i>Please help me.</i>

446
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,840
Die!

447
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,040
Saenkam! You lied to me.

448
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,600
His magic is powerful still.
The amoria bloom had no effect!

449
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,400
Pansaeng, you shall not live.

450
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Dear!

451
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,520
Va!

452
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,440
Muen Vorachai!

453
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,800
It was not my doing!

454
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,920
You ran in the way! I did not do it!

455
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,520
Go! Go!

456
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,800
Why are you here?

457
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,400
Why must you do this?! Huh?!

458
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,720
I… I…

459
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,320
was glad to do this.

460
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,280
Your life…

461
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,960
is invaluable, dear.

462
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,000
Va… Va…

463
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,760
Va!

464
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,840
Va! Va! Va!

465
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,640
Va!

466
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,840
Boil this for her to drink
three times a day. Do not forget.

467
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,680
How is she doing?

468
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,560
With a wound this deep,

469
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,240
you should probably
try to accept the fate,

470
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,840
Khun Saengplarn.

471
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,680
Why did the physician
shake his head, Laor?

472
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
Is this how much you hate me?

473
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,720
You gave me a chance to be born.

474
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,240
Yet you let my parents
and my sister die before my eyes.

475
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,280
And now you bring this woman here

476
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,440
only for her to die in my arms as well?!

477
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,160
Why do you not take my life?!

478
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,720
Take it!

479
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,320
Why do you not take it?!

480
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,760
Take it!

481
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,960
It would be less painful.

482
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,240
It would be less painful!

483
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,760
She is but a wicked sister.

484
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,400
She is but a vile sister.

485
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,360
She took all the love from me.

486
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,200
She took my people away.

487
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,160
She took everything from me.

488
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,720
It was not my doing!

489
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,280
<i>We were so hostile towards each other</i>

490
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,960
<i>that we ended up fighting.</i>

491
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,360
I wish to know

492
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,960
if you still love me.

493
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,360
Of course, I love you.

494
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,680
There were many times

495
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,000
I hated you so much
that I wanted to kill you myself.

496
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,120
Now that time has passed,

497
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,040
my love for you remains.

498
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,880
I could not cut ties with you.

499
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,000
I wish for you to know

500
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,400
that I love you.

501
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,320
I told you

502
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,800
she ran to stand in the way herself!

503
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,200
I did not do it! It was not me!
She did it to herself!

504
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,800
It was not my doing…

505
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,000
See for yourselves. Come.

506
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,320
Master! Is he hurt this much?

507
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,680
The authority sent in the soldiers.

508
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,640
Master Saenkam has not
done anything to harm them.

509
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,360
He was only lying asleep,
and they came to fatally wound him.

510
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,280
The authorities must be jealous that
the citizens trust Master Saenkam more.

511
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,480
Who was it that hurt him?

512
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,680
His name is Khun Saengplarn.

513
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,280
- Huh?! Khun Saengplarn?!
- Khun Saengplarn?

514
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,200
- What?!
- I know that all of you

515
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,320
love Master Saenkam
and wish to protect him.

516
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,880
Go to Khun Saengplarn's house.

517
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,680
Go curse him, all of you.

518
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,640
Go scold him and let him know
that we shall not accept this!

519
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,400
- Go! We shall go!
- This is unacceptable!

520
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,880
- Go! Go!
- We shall not tolerate this!

521
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,680
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out! Go away!

522
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,760
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away! Go away!

523
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,240
- What are the citizens doing here?
- Get out!

524
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,520
- I wonder the same. Let us take a look.
- Go away!

525
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,880
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out! Get out!

526
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,400
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away!

527
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,120
- Get out!
- Hey!

528
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
What is this?!

529
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,560
Khun Saengplarn
has assaulted our Master Saenkam!

530
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,440
- We shall not tolerate it!
- We shall not! Get out!

531
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,960
- Get out!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

532
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,440
Has your blind trust in that sorcerer
made you forget the sacrifices

533
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,920
Khun Saengplarn has made

534
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,480
hunting down countless
thieves and bandits?! Huh?!

535
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,680
True! And your master
has only been playing tricks

536
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,520
conjuring leaves.
How could you all believe him?

537
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,200
Stop disrespecting him!
He helped my mother recover from illness!

538
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,640
Uncle! You are not acknowledging
the doctor and the medicine at all?

539
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,360
Khun Saengplarn tried to kill
Master Saenkam in his house.

540
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,720
Is it acceptable for a civil servant
to do this to a citizen?!

541
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,800
Hey, are you out of your mind?
Tried to kill him in his house?

542
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,960
What are you all saying?
This is a baseless accusation.

543
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,400
- Get out! Get out!
- Go away!

544
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,960
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out! Get out!

545
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,000
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out! Get out!

546
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,760
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out! Go!

547
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,400
Buddha protects.

548
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,560
Dharma cures.

549
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,040
Please ease her pain.

550
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,920
<i>Please mend her wound.</i>

551
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,120
Hand me.

552
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,160
Yes, sir.

553
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,160
<i>Itipi so</i>

554
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,880
<i>Methaya</i>

555
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,920
Here. Va.

556
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,000
Please wake up.

557
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,440
Wake up for this medicine.

558
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,960
Please.

559
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,720
Va. Hold on a little longer.

560
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,320
Hey.

561
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,480
Do not fall asleep yet.

562
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,280
Va.

563
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,280
You must wake up.

564
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,080
You must fight on, Va.

565
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,720
Did you hear it? Here.

566
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,960
Slowly.

567
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,480
Va…

568
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,760
You must fight on, Va.

569
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,320
Please stay with me, Va.

570
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,000
Do not leave me.

571
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,760
Va…

572
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,400
<i>I have received</i>
<i>a report from Khun Saengplarn.</i>

573
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,080
He accuses Luang Bovorntat

574
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,120
of assaulting him and his wife.

575
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,320
I have no wounds

576
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,240
and was not in a fight with anybody.

577
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,000
Why must good people fall prey and die?

578
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,880
<i>What it takes to revive your lady</i>

579
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,680
<i>is nothing other than love.</i>

580
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,080
- Go away!
- Out!

581
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,800
Even if my bones shatter,

582
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,800
<i>my muscles burn like fire,</i>

583
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,480
<i>and my spirit descends</i>
<i>into the deepest hell,</i>

584
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,840
I shall love you still.

585
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,200
