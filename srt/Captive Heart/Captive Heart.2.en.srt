1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
<i>Those who've ambushed us</i>

2
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,360
<i>were well-armed and highly skilled.</i>
<i>They were not some bandits.</i>

3
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Some noblemen
must be behind this, My Lord.

4
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,920
An insurrection is imminent.

5
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
Look!

6
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,440
It was reported that

7
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,440
- you've kidnapped Lady Chavala.
- Kidnapped?

8
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,800
He doesn't even respect me and my sister.

9
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,600
How do you wish to hold him responsible?

10
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,560
He must hold a wedding ceremony

11
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,480
to restore my sister's honor, My Lord.

12
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
- Wedding?
- We can't let that wedding happen.

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,200
From now on,

14
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,480
could you please protect me?

15
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
Shall we go, Chavala?

16
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Yes, My Lady.

17
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,960
Here's tea, sir, My Lady.

18
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,080
This must be the tea

19
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,560
for celebrating
the union of the newlyweds.

20
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,960
Wait,

21
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,520
- My Lady.
- Yes?

22
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,040
The tea is still hot. Let me hold it.

23
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Here.

24
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,760
There's poison in the tea.

25
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
What did you say?

26
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,680
What?

27
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,560
Who's out there? Come in.

28
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,280
- Yes, sir.
- Yong.

29
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Check this cup.

30
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,600
Find out what kind of poison it is.

31
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,720
It smells like…

32
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,720
some kind of aphrodisiac, sir.

33
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,640
Find the one who prepared these and bring
them to the camp for questioning.

34
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Yes, sir.

35
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
Are you aware of the consequences
for those who put the poison

36
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,720
in the food for a nobleman like myself?

37
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,880
It's not poison, sir.

38
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,560
It's the nourishing herb that will help Va
get pregnant more easily.

39
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Loar, where did you get that kind of herb?

40
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Put this herb in their tea tonight.

41
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
What kind of herb is this, sir?

42
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,120
It's the herb that will help your Va
becomes pregnant sooner.

43
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,080
Don't you want to take care
of the little masters?

44
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
I do, sir.

45
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,120
And don't tell anyone. If you do,

46
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I'll kill both of your parents.

47
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
Understood?

48
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,120
Yes, sir.

49
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
- Someone gave it to me.
- Who?!

50
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,440
I really can't tell you, sir.

51
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,520
Laor.

52
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,360
Listen to me.

53
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,120
If you don't tell us,
you'll be the one responsible.

54
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,560
You'll face all the consequences.

55
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
I can't tell you, My Lady.

56
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
Tell me.

57
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Flog her!

58
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Twenty times!

59
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,880
No.

60
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
- No.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
- Come here.
- No.

62
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,400
Don't do this. She's still young.

63
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,080
She doesn't know any better.
Please don't punish her.

64
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,080
No.

65
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,679
She's your attendant,
therefore, she's one of my people.

66
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,760
If I don't teach her a lesson,
she shall not stay. Take her!

67
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,120
- Va!
- Yes, sir.

68
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
- Va.
- Please don't!

69
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,600
- Va!
- Come here.

70
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,560
Va!

71
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
Va!

72
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
- Let go. Let go of me.
- Hey!

73
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,360
I said let go. Va!

74
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
Laor!

75
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,440
Khun Saengplarn. Sir.

76
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,280
Please have mercy on Laor, sir.
She must be forced to do it.

77
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
If only you had revealed the plan to me,

78
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,960
I wouldn't punish you or Laor.

79
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
It was only an aphrodisiac.

80
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,920
It wasn't intended to kill you.
It was also in my tea.

81
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,040
Didn't you know about my magic?

82
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
Your magic?

83
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
What is this all about, sir?

84
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
<i>I gave this magic to you.</i>

85
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,320
If one day you are consumed by lust

86
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,680
and let yourself be entangled with women,

87
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,200
may every bone in your body shatter.

88
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,840
The flogging is done, sir.

89
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
How is she?

90
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,840
She's soaked in blood,
but didn't tell us anything, sir.

91
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Then pour salt water on her back.

92
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes, sir.

93
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
No. Sir.

94
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
I've seen that herb in the market.

95
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,800
They're not fatal.
You can't punish her this much over this.

96
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Laor! Laor. Sir.

97
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,920
I beg you.

98
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,720
Please stop punishing Laor.

99
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,040
Then tell me all about your plan!

100
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,400
If not, you and your people
will be tortured.

101
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,360
I don't know anything!

102
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,440
You think I'm setting you a trap. But I
don't even know what that trap is for.

103
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,080
Bring out the nail-stamping device!

104
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,240
Use it on her fingers and toes!

105
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,200
- No.
- Yes, sir!

106
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,600
No! Laor! Don't! Sir.

107
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
You are a monster! You're cruel!

108
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,280
- How could you be this cruel?!
- Hey!

109
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,440
- You!
- Huh?!

110
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,120
- You're a monster! A deceiver!
- Hey.

111
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,320
You were acting like you admired me,

112
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,840
when, in fact, you hate me!

113
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,800
You are the biggest deceiver!

114
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
Stop!

115
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,520
Let go of me!

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,720
You're attacking me this time.

117
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
So, it's time for your punishment.

118
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,320
Good. Kill me.

119
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Go ahead and kill me.

120
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,160
I sell all the goods every day
without sleep to pay off the debts!

121
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,400
The debts that I didn't even cause.

122
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,040
I did good all my life, and what do I get?

123
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,320
The one who's despicable

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,960
still remains despicable.
He doesn't think for a second to repent.

125
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
If he's that bad toward you,
why do you have to keep his secret?!

126
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,160
You're a monster! You're a deceiver!

127
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,600
Why are people in my life so cruel?

128
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,680
You're a deceiver! Both you

129
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,240
and my brother.
What do you both think I am?

130
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,760
What animal do you think I am?!

131
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,680
Laor! I'm coming for you.

132
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Laor! Laor!

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Laor! I'm here!

134
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,920
- What the…?!
- Va?

135
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,640
Laor!

136
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,240
Are you hurt? Let me see.

137
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,640
Are you injured, Laor?

138
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,880
Have you not been flogged?

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,640
No, My Lady.
Yong was only flogging that decoy.

140
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Enough.

141
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
You tricked me.

142
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,440
Laor is a debt-bound servant.

143
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,440
Are her parents still with your brother?

144
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Well.

145
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,520
That herb.

146
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,360
Your brother used Laor's parents
to force her to do it.

147
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Sometimes, our karmic nemesis
wears the face of family.

148
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,840
No matter how much they torture you

149
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,000
or take advantage of you,
you can't cut them from your life.

150
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Before having mercy on others,

151
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
you should be merciful to yourself first.

152
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,680
Give yourself happiness

153
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,280
in order to be able to help others.

154
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
<i>Aham Sukhito homi.</i>

155
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,920
May I be happy.

156
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,000
<i>Aham Niddukkho homi.</i>

157
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
May I be free from suffering.

158
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
If you don't want to tolerate this,
then run away.

159
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Start over in another town.

160
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
You're allowed to.

161
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,000
Run away?

162
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,000
I can run away?

163
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,040
This is a royal-bestowed marriage, sir.

164
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,920
I shall make no claim for retribution.

165
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,960
No one shall seek to punish you.

166
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
You can go wherever you want.

167
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,120
It's fine.

168
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,079
Khun Saengplarn's house seems to be empty.

169
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,359
Looks like he's barely home.

170
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,240
I thought the sorcerer's home would be
scarier. Look at this. It's nothing.

171
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,400
And do you know why he wasn't
coming home with us, My Lady?

172
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
They have all taken off. I heard they're
going to train new soldiers in Ban Khok.

173
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,840
He was just married but doesn't
want to take some time off work?

174
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Right.

175
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,480
If we run away, what is going to happen?

176
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,720
Chavala prevented me
from ascending to the rank of Khun.

177
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,960
If she ran away like this… Saiyud.

178
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,320
I can't take this anymore!

179
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,200
I don't care if I die today!

180
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,240
Muen Vorachai! Sir!

181
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,120
Aon!

182
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,360
Aon!

183
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,240
I can't only think of myself.
I really can't.

184
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
A ghost!

185
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,320
I am a human.

186
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm a servant who takes care
of this house, My Lady.

187
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,800
Shall we go, My Lady?

188
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,520
Where are you taking her?

189
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,760
Khun Saengplarn gave me an order.

190
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,440
If you plan to leave for another town,

191
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,560
I shall call for Phuan,
the boatman, for you, My Lady.

192
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,840
Leave for another town?
Where are we going, My Lady?

193
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,080
<i>Om Pluk Maha Pluk</i>

194
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,920
<i>Awaken the sky and the earth</i>

195
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,320
<i>Awaken the river and the sea</i>

196
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,760
<i>Awaken Indra and Brahma</i>

197
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
<i>Svaha</i>

198
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,960
<i>Svahom</i>

199
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
Water, sir.

200
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Thank you.

201
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,160
Ask him.

202
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,960
Sir, is it true that you're not allowed
to bed any women?

203
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,160
Why do you lot have to know?

204
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,160
So, you can't have feelings for them,

205
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,960
but you might bed them
for your entertainment without feelings.

206
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,320
Is this allowed, sir?

207
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
What is going on with you three?

208
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,960
Well, I saw that there's…

209
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
Some wounds on your neck, sir.

210
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,720
I think…

211
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,560
What animal do you think I am?!

212
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,280
They're wounds from a bride's nails.
You're invulnerable.

213
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,320
Enemies couldn't pierce your skin.
But a woman in an intimate time

214
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
surprisingly could. Is that right, sir?

215
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,960
You three will face me!

216
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,000
Harn is there, sir!

217
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,840
Get out!

218
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,400
- You!
- Harn!

219
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,560
Go oversee the soldiers' training at once!

220
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,080
Hey. There are a lot of flowers.

221
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,360
We're away for only two weeks
and the house changed this much?

222
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,080
And the Lazy Tian is now working.

223
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,480
Look.

224
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,840
Let's go.

225
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,160
Are you back, sir?

226
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,160
Yes.

227
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
- This is no good, Yong, Ming.
- Why?

228
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,160
A lady who seduces a man
with her body will be ignored in no time.

229
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,920
But a lady who charms a man
with warmth and grace…

230
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,680
Look.

231
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't think he can resist for long.

232
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,280
I shall start working now, My Lady.

233
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Why are you still here?

234
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,240
I gave you a chance
to start your life anew.

235
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
If I go,

236
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,640
my brothers and sisters in that house
will be tortured with no one to help.

237
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
You meant the servants in your house?

238
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,560
Yes.

239
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,640
My parents would be criticized
for not educating their children.

240
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,320
Their daughter runs away
from the royal-bestowed marriage,

241
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,160
which is considered an insult to the king.

242
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,480
And their son

243
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
might be punished
for killing servants someday.

244
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
How are you supposed to stop
a mean-spirited one like your brother?

245
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,880
I couldn't stop him, but you could, sir.

246
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,240
How am I a part of this?

247
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,560
Because you're my husband.

248
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,120
You can help my servants.

249
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,760
Husband? Why do you think
a husband can do that?

250
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,240
Sir.

251
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,880
I'm just a woman. I can't protect anyone.

252
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,320
But you are Khun Saengplarn,
the one feared by all. You can help them.

253
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,760
With your uncle's passing,
you have no one left to rely on.

254
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,320
So, you're relying on me now, aren't you?

255
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
I beg you.

256
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,920
Consider me as a stray,
looking for a place under your care.

257
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,880
My duties are to take care
of the house, meals, and clothing.

258
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,600
Everything a wife is supposed to do,

259
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,480
I shall do it, and I shall do it well.

260
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,120
Sir.

261
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,040
Everything a wife is supposed to do?

262
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,200
Is that all a wife should do?

263
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,400
I've offered you a chance to go
and yet you stay. That means

264
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,840
you really want to be my wife.

265
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,240
Henceforth,
your every breath belongs to me,

266
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,440
not your brother.

267
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,280
If you and your people
think of betraying me,

268
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,960
all the needles, nails, and buffalo hide
will be summoned into your gut.

269
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,880
I'll also conjure all the cursed dolls
and damned spirits to haunt you!

270
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,920
Sir. Are those dolls inside
possessed by damned spirits?

271
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes!

272
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,720
You've made a mistake
by choosing me as your husband.

273
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
Because our marriage

274
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,080
is basically a living hell.

275
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,840
I don't eat anything cooked by others.

276
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,720
So, don't cook for me ever again.

277
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
Tian!

278
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,360
- Tian!
- Yes, sir?

279
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,040
Grill a fish and cook
some rice for me, as usual.

280
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,480
Yes, sir.

281
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,000
We were up making the soup all night.
What a waste, Va.

282
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,040
Whatever. He can suit himself.
We still need to cook.

283
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,000
We have to eat too, don't we, Laor?

284
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,840
Yes, My Lady.

285
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,720
Laor. We've been living here for weeks.

286
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,200
Did you hear anything late at night?

287
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,840
Hmm. The strange-looking dolls
in the shrine room

288
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,760
do scare me, My Lady.

289
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Khun Saengplarn practices dark magic.

290
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,920
They say those who practice
usually keep spirits…

291
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,480
Please don't harm me!

292
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,440
Please don't harm me!

293
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,680
- Laor.
- Yes?!

294
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,680
See for yourself.

295
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,240
Sugar palm fruits.

296
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,120
How did it end up here, Va?

297
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,320
Exactly.

298
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,840
- Laor.
- Yes?

299
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,840
- What are you doing?
- Filling up water buckets.

300
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,080
It's late now.
You can do it tomorrow. Let's go.

301
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,840
If we don't have water
and you need to relieve yourself,

302
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,560
what would you do?

303
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm fine, Laor. We should do it tomorrow.

304
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,000
Let's continue tomorrow.

305
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,480
Don't come near us!

306
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
It's me, Tian!

307
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,320
Is this really you?

308
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
Who kicked me?

309
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,840
Why did you kick me?!

310
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,800
And what do you think you're doing?
Why are you dressed like that?

311
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,920
Khun Saengplarn told me

312
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,160
that we're not living alone anymore.

313
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,760
With women in the household,
I need to dress properly.

314
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,840
I thought you were
a spirit child that he keeps.

315
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,080
He doesn't keep any spirits, My Lady.

316
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,840
He said that
keeping spirits bound is sinful.

317
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,639
Keeping them for one's personal use

318
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,199
is wrong. He does no such thing.

319
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,840
So, this house has no spirits?

320
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,000
Not a single one, My Lady.

321
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,320
I've been living here for a long time,

322
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,239
often alone, and didn't see anything.

323
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,880
- Khun Saengplarn, you…
- Va!

324
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,199
You scared me, Tian.

325
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,239
I only want to be handsome for once.

326
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,719
Ever since I knew you,
you've been deceiving me all along!

327
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
How did I ever deceive you?

328
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,520
About Laor and now the spirits!

329
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Well, hold on.

330
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
You've been deceiving me as well.

331
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,440
I haven't.

332
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,920
Sir, I'm a merchant. I always see
those crooks selling spoiled sweets.

333
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,080
Do you know what I said to them?

334
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,440
What?

335
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,400
You slimy creep!
You crusty toenail! You fool!

336
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,560
Did you know that
I couldn't sleep for four nights?!

337
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,080
I've been so sleepy and stressed!
I kept getting spooked by noises!

338
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,760
Even the fallen leaves scared me!
I can't live happily because of you!

339
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,240
Your mouth is as foul
as any other merchant's.

340
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,880
Then, as for the protection
of your servants,

341
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
it shall be rescinded.

342
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,600
Protection of my servants?

343
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,000
Rescinded?

344
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,800
- What?
- Well, sir.

345
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,200
What are you doing?

346
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,760
- Sir.
- Hey.

347
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,280
I said that to those merchants.

348
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,320
Why did you think I cursed at you?
It would never happen, sir.

349
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,240
You are powerful and magical.

350
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,880
You are my shade under the sun,
my refreshing stream, my serene shelter,

351
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
- my sacred temple, my…
- Enough.

352
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,600
Khun Saengplarn, sir.

353
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,720
You haven't promised me that
you would care for my people before.

354
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,760
Are you giving me your word now?

355
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,280
Are you, sir?

356
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
No.

357
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,120
I was joking.

358
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
There. You deceived me again.

359
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,240
Those servants belong to the debt holder.

360
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,960
Messing with other people's servants
is against the law.

361
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,800
Also, it's disrespectful to your brother.
Good men don't do such things.

362
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,720
Is it tasty?

363
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,160
You're the only one eating here.

364
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,160
I shall let you help me cook
when you're older.

365
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,920
Hey, come take this food away.

366
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,960
I told you I won't eat it.

367
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,680
I won't eat it!

368
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,560
Ugh! Hey!

369
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
I heard you loud and clear!
Why did you have to yell?!

370
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,600
I shall take them away now, sir.

371
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,640
He didn't even touch anything.
Doesn't he like any of this, My Lady?

372
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,040
He doesn't dislike them.
He doesn't trust us.

373
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,960
Tian! Tian!

374
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,080
If Khun Saengplarn
wishes to eat only grilled fish,

375
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,320
you need to cook it properly.
I shall teach you how.

376
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,240
I already know how to grill, My Lady.

377
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,440
Tian.

378
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,080
But your fish is dry and tough.

379
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,080
It also has no flavor. There are
many ways to marinate and cook fish.

380
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,000
Don't be lazy. Tian.

381
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,200
He only eats what you cook.

382
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,800
So, you need to cook properly. Understood?

383
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,240
Yes, My Lady.

384
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,520
Va.

385
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,200
- This box is all dusty.
- Come. Let me help.

386
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,960
- My apologies.
- Be more careful, Laor.

387
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Yes.

388
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,360
"Little bird hides its love inside.

389
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,840
With its life missing Pansaeng.

390
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,320
Without our love, I shall die.

391
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,080
Please return your love

392
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,800
to me."

393
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,640
What is it, My Lady?

394
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,320
It's called "Pleng Yao."

395
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,200
Its lyrics are rather touching.

396
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,880
They are not lyrics, Laor.

397
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,360
Pleng Yao is basically a love letter.

398
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,280
Pansaeng? Is it Khun Saengplarn's name?

399
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,640
I think this might be
a love letter from some lady.

400
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,640
A lady? Does he already
have a lover? Who is it?

401
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,640
Forgive me for disturbing you.

402
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,680
Palm seeds in syrup, sir.

403
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,600
No.

404
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,320
Take it away.

405
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,520
I spent a long time selecting perfect
palms in syrup, not too raw or too ripe.

406
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,520
I had to open up many sugar palm fruits.
I had to simmer sugar in jasmine water.

407
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,040
And the sugar came all the way on a boat
from Phetchaburi. And I did all this

408
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,400
to return your kindness, sir.

409
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,400
Are you cold toward me

410
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,080
because you're already
eyeing someone else?

411
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,000
Huh?

412
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm in the way of you two,
so you intended to drive me away.

413
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,840
You could have told me. I understand.

414
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,880
What are you talking about?
I'm not following.

415
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,160
Do you wish for me to go?

416
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,200
Yes.

417
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,200
Yes, sir.

418
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,240
I wish for you to go to the palace
with me in a few days.

419
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,640
What is our business in the palace?

420
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,680
I must introduce you to the seniors.

421
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,040
Right. But…

422
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,560
Well, I became a problem,

423
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,680
so Father stopped bringing me there.

424
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,960
What kind of problem?

425
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,400
Disciples of Prai, attack!

426
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,080
- Come here!
- No!

427
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,520
Come!

428
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,960
Come with me!

429
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,680
Move!

430
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,160
Go! Kill them!

431
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,120
I didn't want to wear
these itchy clothes. But this time,

432
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,920
they're rather comfortable. Well.

433
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,680
- Do I look good?
- Very good, sir.

434
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,680
Lady Va boiled them,
washed them, and pressed them.

435
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,000
I've never washed any of them.

436
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
I only requested new ones, sir.

437
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,480
Oh, Tian.

438
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,080
Is that how lazy you are?
No wonder they were so itchy.

439
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,560
Lady Va is ready, sir.

440
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,480
You are both beautiful,
like Enau and Busaba.

441
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,280
Your necklace is so beautiful, My Lady.

442
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,200
Is it?

443
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,160
Is this your family's necklace?

444
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,280
It's gorgeous.

445
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,520
Not as gorgeous as yours, Lady Nuanchawee.

446
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,040
Where did you find
such a beautiful yellow sapphire?

447
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,440
This couple looks
rather lovely with small jewelry.

448
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,560
His father is but a governor
of a third-tier frontier province.

449
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,880
But the son ascended to the rank of Khun.

450
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,680
They must not have many possessions

451
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,080
But over time,
their children will gain fortune.

452
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,040
Jewelry would only
occupy space in the closet.

453
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,800
But the good we do will ensure
our family is remembered in history.

454
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,640
Our children would be more proud.

455
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,720
Hey.

456
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,040
My apologies.
I was thinking out loud, My Ladies.

457
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,280
The depths of the human mind
are unfathomable.

458
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,880
Those who claim
that possessions are meaningless

459
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,360
are likely the ones who own nothing

460
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,080
and never will.
So, they deem possessions unneeded.

461
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,400
I'm only sharpening my mind with words.
Please forgive me.

462
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,280
My name is Pimpilai.

463
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,120
Conversations regarding privilege

464
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,720
would only be beneficial
with good intentions, My Lady.

465
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,000
But if not…

466
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,880
If the intention is to bring others down
and serve only yourself,

467
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,960
the conversation is a waste of time.

468
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,720
Please excuse me and Lady Chavala.

469
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,520
I now understand why
your father stopped bringing you here.

470
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Father once told me that I am sharp.

471
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,720
But those who are truly sharp
must also be mindful, sir.

472
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,000
Be mindful of when to speak or be silent.

473
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,640
I've never learned at all.

474
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,360
Please forgive me, sir.

475
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,800
I was being rude.
Will you be called to educate, sir?

476
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,800
I kept being educated every time.

477
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,560
Rude. Impudent. Arrogant.

478
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,520
I've been called all sorts of things.

479
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,160
The conversation is a waste of time?

480
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,400
I completely agree with that.

481
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,040
This is only the beginning.

482
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,720
That is the Women's Pavilion.

483
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,920
The ladies of the royal court
will treat noblemen's wives.

484
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,120
You must join them.

485
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,840
As for me, I shall continue to discuss
royal affairs in another building.

486
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,480
Yes, sir.

487
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,560
- Take care of your Lady.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,520
Please forgive me
for my inappropriate remarks earlier.

489
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,360
Are you Lady Chavala?

490
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,960
Yes.

491
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,560
Khun Saengplarn and I have known
each other for a very long time.

492
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,480
He was once a student of my father's.

493
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,760
Jaokhun Kaewkarop.

494
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Yes.

495
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,440
We were so close.

496
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,280
I still write to him to this day.

497
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,840
"Little bird hides its love inside."

498
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,800
The letter with a bird…

499
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,960
You knew?

500
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,200
Yes.

501
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,800
Such embarrassment.

502
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,120
Please have some tea, My Ladies.

503
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,560
I actually wish to show you all
one piece of jewelry.

504
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,200
This necklace.

505
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,920
I heard this is of the household
of Jaokhun Rat.

506
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,360
Muen Vorachai turned their house into
a gambling den. They have nothing left.

507
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,360
This is unaltered. Very beautiful.

508
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,240
Wow. Gorgeous.

509
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,080
- So beautiful.
- Isn't it?

510
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,080
Is this necklace…

511
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,480
This nine-gem Necklace
is really beautiful.

512
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,200
Where did you get it, Lady Pim?

513
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,680
Someone mortgaged it,
but I don't know who.

514
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,400
It's an antique.

515
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,560
It must be some noble fallen from grace.

516
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,040
Unfortunately, ungrateful children
are plenty these days.

517
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,040
They sell family possessions for a living.

518
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,160
- So pretty.
- True, Lady Nuan.

519
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,800
Really pretty.

520
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,560
Va. Please stop, Va.

521
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,280
Laor, that necklace
was always around my father's neck.

522
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,360
And Chai was senseless enough to sell it.

523
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,480
How am I supposed to face
my parents when I die?

524
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,760
I couldn't protect
any of their possessions, Laor.

525
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,120
Va.

526
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,320
Please don't cry, Va.

527
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,120
- Va.
- I couldn't do anything, Laor.

528
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,080
It's fine, Va. Please don't cry.

529
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,000
Rice is plentiful in the north this year,
so we brought many jars of liquor.

530
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,240
Grandfather wishes
for all of you to have some.

531
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,040
Please convey my thanks
to Jao Khamla, your grandfather.

532
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:32,640
Yes, My Lord.

533
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,880
This is liquor from Khum Chao Luang.

534
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,360
Tonight will be a long night.

535
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,040
Long night.

536
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,880
Gentlemen.
Before everyone loses their senses,

537
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,720
I must interrupt your celebration.

538
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,320
I'm afraid that
an insurrection is imminent.

539
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,640
What are you saying, Jaokhun?

540
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,560
Our nation seems to be at peace.

541
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,520
Don't you know that spreading fear
is against the law, Jaokhun Singh?

542
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,800
High-ranking nobles love their comfort.
They always divide into factions.

543
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,920
Low-ranking ones do nothing
but suck up to their superiors.

544
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,640
If civil servants forsake the citizens,

545
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,680
strife would emerge everywhere.

546
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Without opportunities,
people would resort to theft.

547
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,840
And if the thieves take all that remains,

548
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,960
who else will they steal from,
if not from you, My Lords?

549
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,280
Hey! Are you cursing us?!

550
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,360
A peasant shall always be a peasant.

551
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,520
Khun Saengplarn merely gave us a warning,
so we can discuss a solution.

552
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,240
Chief of the Armed Forces, sir.
There is a problem.

553
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,400
What is happening?

554
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,360
Prai raided a rural village and violated
the women last night, My Lord.

555
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,640
Prai again?

556
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,760
I wish to carry out this task, My Lords.

557
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,960
- Be very careful.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,360
Then, I wish to go with him, My Lords.

559
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,800
You rarely fight
in battles, Luang Bovorntat.

560
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,600
I'm afraid you would be
in danger, My Lord.

561
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,520
Rarely fighting doesn't mean
I don't know how to fight.

562
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,360
You said that jewelry is unimportant.

563
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,520
Can you see now that they're important?

564
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,160
Did you know

565
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,560
that this necklace
belonged to my father, Lady Pim?

566
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,440
I must know about the one who would
become Khun Saengplarn's wife, for safety.

567
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,600
I understand. You got married
out of necessity, didn't you?

568
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,360
Anyone who can keep you safe.

569
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,560
Anyone who can keep you fed.

570
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,440
Anyone?

571
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:46,840
I've been seeing him for almost a decade.

572
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,280
I turned down countless royalties
and nobles who courted me

573
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,880
because I'm only committed to Pansaeng.

574
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,520
I pity myself so much.

575
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,160
Pity yourself?

576
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,520
All you care about is your resentment.
You never think of others.

577
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,480
You can cause others pain without remorse.
You are really…

578
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,320
high-born, but nothing else
is high about you.

579
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,800
Ugh.

580
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,120
Laor.

581
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,280
Mark my words.

582
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,600
I shall not cry
because of this lady again.

583
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,600
No matter how much she wants to see,
I shall show no pain.

584
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,840
Never.

585
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,800
This is how my Va should be.
The nine-gem Necklace

586
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,480
shall be yours one day,
as long as we live.

587
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,520
<i>All Master Prai's disciples, be prepared.</i>
<i>We shall hold the power of this nation.</i>

588
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,680
Prai is a monster, not human anymore.

589
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,360
It's important to strike
with full force at the same time.

590
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,120
I am here!

591
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,240
Why are you here?

592
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,280
Are you asleep all this time?

593
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,000
Jaokhun Kaew allowed
Lady Pim to be with you.

594
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,840
Yes, sir.

595
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,960
Pansaeng was slashed by Prai's blade.
Take this opportunity.

596
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,320
Put this herb in his food.

597
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,040
Is it a love potion or poison?

598
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:45,200
