1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Saenkam!

2
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,920
- Capture him! Capture him!
- Capture him! Capture him!

3
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,600
If any of you wish
to be rammed in the guts,

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
then try me.

5
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,480
This Saenkam shall only bring destruction

6
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,840
<i>to anyone who supports him!</i>

7
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
The same goes
for all these people behind me.

8
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
They are overflowing
with hatred and anger,

9
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,080
enough to destroy you many times over!

10
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,640
<i>And if our master comes to help us</i>
<i>tomorrow, the three of us shall kill him!</i>

11
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,120
You shall face me today.

12
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
<i>Noi, come and take your revenge!</i>

13
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
<i>Phin, my dear, come and drag him to hell!</i>

14
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,320
You lowly ghosts!

15
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
What can you possibly do to me?!

16
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,760
I curse you to the deepest hell.

17
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,880
The prison of Ayothaya awaits you!

18
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
<i>The cane of Revered Grandfather Chote</i>

19
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,080
shall protect you from Saenkam's magic

20
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
and prevent him from breaking out.

21
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,399
Darn it!

22
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
Where are you, Master?

23
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,880
Please help me.

24
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,680
Master Taen!

25
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
Master Taen Seenil!

26
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,320
Silence! Stop yelling!

27
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,960
Master Taen Seenil!

28
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
- More liquor.
- Why are you bald?

29
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
- I just disrobed.
- Oh.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
I see.

31
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,880
My time is now!

32
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,240
I need you to bring
these cloths somewhere.

33
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
Where is it, Master?

34
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,120
Why would Master send this message
to an inmate such as me?

35
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED

36
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,800
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED
WE SHALL HOLD THE POWER OF THIS NATION

37
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,360
ALL MASTER PRAI'S DISCIPLES, BE PREPARED
WE SHALL HOLD THE POWER OF THIS NATION

38
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
You know that I am in prison.

39
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,400
Why would you rally your forces in here?

40
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Chai.

41
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
Here is your meal.

42
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,800
Have you had a fever in the past few days?

43
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Take this medicine.

44
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Your eyes are red again.

45
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
Did you go to visit your brother?

46
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Yes.

47
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
Chai is consumed by fever.

48
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,640
And so are you.

49
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
Everyone is dying.

50
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,280
Do not reject death.

51
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
Do not fear it.

52
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,720
Cry if you wish to cry.

53
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
After that…

54
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
…you must accept it.

55
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,400
No.

56
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,640
I cannot do it, dear.

57
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,920
Once we accept death,

58
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
we shall be mindful of it.

59
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,480
We shall realize

60
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,960
we do not have much time.

61
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,440
And we shall prioritize what is important

62
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
over what is not.

63
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,520
We shall realize

64
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,680
what we truly wish for.

65
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,520
What I truly wish for…

66
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
…is Chai accepting his misdeeds

67
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,480
and changing his ways.

68
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,440
Any ways to achieve it?

69
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,800
Hm?

70
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,800
I must let him know

71
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,160
that I still have hope
for his eventual return to righteousness.

72
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,920
I understand now.

73
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,640
From tomorrow on,

74
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,480
I shall go
and let him know that every day.

75
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
It does not matter how long our lives are.

76
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
What does matter

77
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,400
is how we live our lives to the fullest.

78
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
Can you smile?

79
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Smile…

80
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,960
for us who are facing death. Myself…

81
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,400
and Muen Chai.

82
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
No, dear.

83
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
I cannot live with it.

84
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
I cannot live with it.

85
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,520
Why can you not?

86
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,320
Even you, yourself…

87
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,920
may face death before me or Muen Chai.

88
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,080
Plague.

89
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,960
Boat sinking.

90
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
Death comes in many ways.

91
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
I fear my own death,

92
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,280
but not as much as my loved ones',

93
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,840
who shall leave me alone without them.

94
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,160
I am so afraid, dear.

95
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
This room

96
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,880
is full of bullet wood fragrance from you.

97
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,880
I think of you every night I sleep.

98
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
Can you sleep beside me tonight?

99
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
Dear.

100
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,720
Your greatest wish

101
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,440
is for Muen Chai
to return to the right path.

102
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,520
But

103
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,240
my heart's truest desire

104
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,600
is to live out our days together
as ordinary husband and wife.

105
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
We may not be able to bed each other,

106
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,640
but perhaps we can lie and talk all night.

107
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,520
I shall remember these moments.

108
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,640
In every life,

109
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
I wish to always
stay by your side in this manner.

110
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
Take it. Here.

111
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Has this girl no shame?
It is the middle of the day.

112
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
Disgusting.

113
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
Ming!

114
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,520
- Ming!
- Laor? What are you doing?!

115
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,640
I did no such a thing.

116
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
You!

117
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,440
No, Ming! Stop! Enough!

118
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
- Ming, stop!
- What, Laor?

119
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,840
What?

120
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,080
Thong was not violating me.
I only fell on him.

121
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Why are you protecting him?
You have not realized his dirty thoughts.

122
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
Hey, you are accusing me.

123
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,440
I thought of no such thing.

124
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,120
Laor is my little sister.

125
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,440
Keep your hands off her.

126
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,760
- Ming!
- Die.

127
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Ming, stop!

128
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,600
Are you not stopping?
Do you wish to continue?

129
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
What?! Are you blindfolding me?!

130
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,440
Must you push me?

131
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,400
No, I kicked you.

132
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
I hate men
with constant dirty minds the most.

133
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,000
And do you hate yourself
for visiting a brothel every day?

134
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,520
Laor. Thong has not proposed to you.

135
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,960
He has no right to touch you.
Do you understand?

136
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,200
This is truly disrespectful.

137
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,840
I am ordering you

138
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,080
to cut ties with him from now on.

139
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I will not.

140
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
Even my father
does not forbid me from such a thing.

141
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
- And who do you think you are?
- I…

142
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,560
Well, I am no one.

143
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,520
If that is how you see me,
then this is the end for us.

144
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,080
Thong has reported it to me.

145
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,560
I shall have to punish you
according to the law.

146
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,400
Could you not pretend
it did not happen, sir?

147
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,840
No. The law is the law.

148
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,480
I must imprison you for seven days.

149
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,240
During your time in there,
pray and meditate.

150
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,520
She claimed my life is goalless,
and now I must go to prison.

151
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,800
Perhaps Laor was right.

152
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,160
Today, I asked Thong if he was drinking.

153
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,360
And he told me he has not.

154
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,120
And he did not intend to violate Laor.

155
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,400
He is interested
in learning from me as well.

156
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,400
It is no surprise
Laor favors Thong more than you.

157
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,120
Then why do you not accept him?

158
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,680
You have been seeking
good disciples for a long time.

159
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,360
You detest Yong and me
for drinking every day.

160
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,720
I do.

161
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,080
To be trained in the art of sorcery,

162
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
you truly need mental focus.

163
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
Would you remember
any of my teachings if you drank all day?

164
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,160
If you do not quit drinking,

165
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,800
I shall truly replace you with Thong.

166
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,080
Very well, sir. As you wish.

167
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,200
Ming!

168
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,480
You were an orphan.

169
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,520
I am the one who cares about you the most!

170
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,920
If you truly like Laor,

171
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,400
you must prove yourself

172
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,080
worthy of having
a smart and kind woman such as her.

173
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,560
Perhaps I am done with Laor.

174
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,920
Please do not speak of that name.

175
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,680
Then do it for me.

176
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,800
I do not have much time left, Ming.

177
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,960
I truly wish to train you in my craft.

178
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,880
Can you do it or not?

179
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Can you do it or not?!

180
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
We must stop drinking?

181
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,480
Yes.

182
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
And he mentioned Laor as well.

183
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
He always tells me to get with Laor.

184
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,160
Does he think
Laor is the only woman I see?

185
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,920
Is she truly beautiful?

186
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,680
She is feisty and fierce as well.

187
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,320
If you wed her, she would
probably scold you every day.

188
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,640
There is another matter.

189
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,720
He told me
he does not have much time left.

190
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,640
What did he mean
by not having much time left?

191
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,680
Come here.

192
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,600
See for yourself.

193
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,080
Ming, look at him.

194
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,720
He is losing his skills.

195
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,000
He has been for a while.

196
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,440
Is it because
he's infatuated with his wife?

197
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,400
Similar to Prai, his senior disciple.

198
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,680
His magic has faded,

199
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,800
and he has eventually
been imprisoned in Ayothaya.

200
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,200
Khun Saengplarn!

201
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
Sir! Sir.

202
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Easy, Harn.

203
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
The people of Ayothaya are frightened!

204
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,920
- What is happening?
- Look, sir.

205
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,920
Yong. What is that?

206
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,320
Taen Seenil.

207
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,760
Taen Seenil is coming.

208
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,080
Taen Seenil!

209
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,080
Taen Seenil is coming.

210
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Who is Taen Seenil?

211
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,600
He is the most fearsome

212
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
sorcerer of this land.

213
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,640
He has disappeared for decades.

214
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,960
Ayothaya is doomed!

215
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,720
How are we supposed to live?!

216
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
No!

217
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,360
- What must we do?!
- No!

218
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,720
Our insurrection begins now.

219
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,680
<i>Master Taen. Shall we begin</i>
<i>our plan for the insurrection?</i>

220
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,080
<i>I am fully ready.</i>

221
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,760
Va.

222
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,800
Dear.

223
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,160
This is not normal, is it?

224
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,680
Taen Seenil is terrorizing us all
with his power.

225
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
Dear.

226
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,320
There is one thing I am not certain of.

227
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,960
What is it?

228
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,720
Did Prai, too,
serve as a disciple to Taen Seenil?

229
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,640
Prai

230
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,920
was once my senior disciple
in the same school.

231
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,440
He had been wielding white magic

232
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
but later turned

233
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,240
into the master of thieves.

234
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,200
There were red cloths in the prison.

235
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,440
And now Taen Seenil is showing his power.

236
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Is it possible that…

237
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Prai

238
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,840
has become Taen Seenil's disciple.

239
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,480
And

240
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,320
Taen Seenil is the master
of the rebel Luang Bovorntat

241
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,000
and Prai, the vicious thief.

242
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,360
Ayothaya faces dire peril right now.

243
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,760
- Dear.
- Tian! Where are you?!

244
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,480
Yes, sir!

245
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
Rush to Jaokhun Singh's house.

246
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
Run as fast as you can.

247
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Jaokhun Singh's house, sir?

248
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,800
Will they allow
a child such as me to enter?

249
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,200
Whether they let you in or not,
you must find a way

250
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,120
to get to Jaokhun Singh.

251
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,880
Listen to my words.

252
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,200
The fate of Ayothaya is now in your hands.

253
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,760
What?!

254
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,040
Duly noted, sir.

255
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,280
What am I to tell Jaokhun Singh, sir?

256
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,400
The Ayothaya prison is about to fall.

257
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
We need his forces immediately.

258
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,480
Yes, sir!

259
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,440
The prison is about to be breached!
We need more men!

260
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,400
Wrong way.

261
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,840
I must go that way.

262
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,040
The prison is about to be breached!
We need more men!

263
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,000
Greetings, Master.

264
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,680
You and I

265
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,400
shall focus our magic power at the cells

266
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,280
in the prison of Ayothaya.

267
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,040
- Shall we break out the inmates?
- Yes.

268
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,560
The prisoners are mostly former thieves.

269
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,160
They were the disciples of Prai.

270
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,480
I need them to rejoin Prai.

271
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,400
Prai?

272
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,160
Does he work for you as well, Master?

273
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
Saenkam has failed.

274
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,400
We must find new allies.

275
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,920
We must use these vicious thieves

276
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
to help take over this nation.

277
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,400
Understood, Master.

278
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,200
The prison is about to be breached!

279
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,560
Khun Saengplarn sent me
to inform Jaokhun Singh!

280
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
The prison is about to be breached!

281
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,360
Is Prai a disciple of Master Taen?

282
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,520
Master Taen has freed me and all of us!

283
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,080
Brothers!

284
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,840
Come with me,
and we shall join Prai's band!

285
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,880
- Yes!
- Yes!

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Master.
Has your master truly come for you?

287
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,840
Perhaps your sickness hallucinates you.

288
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
Behold.

289
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,320
- Let us go!
- We are free!

290
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,760
‪-Go, go!
‪-At long last!

291
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,080
‪-Run!
‪-We are free!

292
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,600
Va. What is wrong?

293
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,720
Khun Saengplarn is going
to secure Ayothaya Prison.

294
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,160
But he is very weak now.

295
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,880
Chai is there as well.

296
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Chai must be joining Saenkam
in the breakout.

297
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,480
- I shall go there and help.
- Va, hold on.

298
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
- Laor.
- Va, please stop.

299
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,400
You cannot go.

300
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
You will only be in the way.

301
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,800
Khun Saengplarn will worry about you.
You must not go.

302
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,240
Laor…

303
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,800
But there is nothing I can do.
I will certainly go insane.

304
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,320
Master Nandha once said that

305
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,160
a clouded mind
shall not be able to help with anything.

306
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,640
You must compose yourself.

307
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Let us go pray.

308
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,680
We shall provide mental support for him.

309
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,000
Let us go, Va.

310
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,520
Let us go.

311
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
I am free, Pansaeng.

312
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,240
Now, I shall kill you.

313
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
It shall not be that easy.

314
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Pansaeng! Let go of me!

315
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,560
Pansaeng!

316
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Pansaeng! Free me at once! Free me!

317
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,840
I said free me!

318
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,600
Prisoners have broken out!
Gather more men!

319
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,280
Pansaeng!

320
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,400
There he goes again!

321
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,280
How did he know?

322
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,680
We must be successful

323
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
in killing Pansaeng today!

324
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,920
Taen Seenil has come!

325
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,560
Kill Khun Saengplarn

326
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,000
and join Prai's band!

327
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,240
You have insulted me

328
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,600
about how my magic has faded.

329
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,120
Is that all you have left?!

330
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,840
Do not dare compare yourself to me.

331
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
I am a human being,

332
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,800
but you are not!

333
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,200
This is Khun Saengplarn

334
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,000
who has captured all of you!

335
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,280
He is now devoid of magic,

336
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,480
so kill him!

337
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,240
Jaokhun Singh's company! Fight on!

338
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,240
Jaokhun Singh's company! Fight on!

339
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,160
Khun Saengplarn! We are here to help you!

340
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,080
- Fight on!
- Fight on!

341
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,440
Attack!

342
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,360
Capture all the prisoners!
Do not let them get away!

343
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,560
Any of them who resist must die!

344
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,040
Do not let them get away! Chase them!

345
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,400
‪What?! I yield!

346
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,199
For my parents

347
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,239
and my sister.

348
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,920
What happened, Master?

349
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,440
Saenkam has been slain by Pansaeng.

350
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,960
I shall tolerate you no longer, Pansaeng!

351
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,560
Taen Seenil.

352
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
I have waited my whole life to face you.

353
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
Now I shall have my revenge!

354
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,880
Sir!

355
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,040
Enlivened effigies magic.
Magnificent as people say.

356
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,720
Today

357
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,440
is the day I shall avenge
my parents and my sister.

358
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,520
Not today.

359
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,400
Not yet.

360
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,480
Dear.

361
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,640
Va. Va.

362
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
Laor.

363
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,920
He will do fine.

364
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,120
Your effigies have all been destroyed.

365
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
This is the end for you.

366
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,800
Pansaeng.

367
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,960
It is time for my revenge.

368
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,240
Pansaeng.

369
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,720
Pansaeng is a son to me.

370
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,520
My ancestors,

371
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,440
may the good deeds you and I

372
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,200
have always done for this land

373
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,640
grant Pansaeng protection!

374
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,880
Pansaeng!

375
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,400
Pansaeng. Pansaeng. Pansaeng.

376
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,200
Whoever wishes to kill my son

377
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
shall face me first!

378
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,640
It is the Buddha amulet.

379
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,960
The ancient one
passed on to Jaokhun Singh.

380
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,440
May you protect Pansaeng!

381
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,520
Jaokhun.

382
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,120
Pansaeng.

383
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,840
Master. You must flee. Please retreat!

384
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,040
How did he disappear?

385
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,440
Is he a ghost or a human?

386
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,800
It was his spiritual form.

387
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Pansaeng.

388
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Our soldiers are the victors, my lady.

389
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
The prisoners have been detained.

390
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,840
Some are dead.

391
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,560
But we have won.

392
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,440
Tian. What of Khun Saengplarn?

393
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,960
How is he doing?

394
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,200
Khun Saengplarn, Ming, and others

395
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,960
only have minor injuries.

396
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,920
Their wounds shall be treated at the camp,

397
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,680
and they shall return
home tomorrow, my lady.

398
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,880
Jaokhun Singh asked me to tell you

399
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,160
not to be worried. All of them are safe.

400
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,440
What of Chai?

401
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,120
How is he?

402
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,600
He survived. He woke up in prison.

403
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,360
He is not among the deceased.

404
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,560
You did very well, Tian.

405
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,520
This all occurred because
you swiftly informed Jaokhun Singh.

406
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,800
Should those vicious prisoners
be freed, Ayothaya will be doomed.

407
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I am spirit child Tian.

408
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,440
Entrust me with any errand.
Tell me what you desire.

409
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,640
You have my thanks.

410
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,200
We were able to secure the prison.
It was a success.

411
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,520
We must thank you, Lady Chavala,

412
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,480
for your timely insight.

413
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,720
My lord, I give my thanks to you,

414
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,760
and you as well, dear…

415
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,880
for sparing my brother's life.

416
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,840
My lord.

417
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,440
If this happens again,

418
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,360
please do not risk your life
to save me again.

419
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,840
We are no kin,

420
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,520
but our bond is more than that.

421
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,520
You have fought alongside me

422
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,880
through countless battles.

423
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
I wish for you to have this Buddha amulet.

424
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,080
No, my lord. I cannot accept it.

425
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Why not?

426
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,560
Your son is a soldier as well.

427
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,840
This amulet is his birthright, not mine.

428
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,560
‪Darn it!

429
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,240
How could an ordinary man

430
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,640
such as Jaokhun Singh, with an amulet,

431
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,440
overpower Master Taen?

432
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,920
It was merely a coincidence!

433
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,400
Master Taen had lost
much strength freeing the prisoners.

434
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,280
Next time,

435
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,280
Master Taen
shall kill him with a single blow.

436
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,040
A man of virtue such as yourself

437
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,320
is protected by the angels of heaven.

438
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,480
The good you did for this land

439
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,640
is the greatest power
an ordinary man could wield.

440
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,440
But without you,

441
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,120
I could not stand a chance
against Taen Seenil.

442
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,440
I must create new effigies

443
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,080
to prepare for his next attack.

444
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,320
The enlivened effigies
have been destroyed.

445
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,080
That means he no longer possesses
any special spells.

446
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,040
But we still have Prai.

447
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
We need his help.

448
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,000
It appears we have
a vital mission before us.

449
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,800
I shall ready our forces.

450
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,880
We shall hold the power of this nation!

451
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,840
Lady Va.

452
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,560
Could you please
help my wife in the kitchen?

453
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,760
She is preparing the meal for us.

454
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,960
- Yes, my lord.
- Very well.

455
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Pansaeng.

456
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,840
Your magic has been diminishing

457
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,320
ever since you took a wife.

458
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,480
Are you certain

459
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,960
that you can create new effigies?

460
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,080
Not at all, my lord.

461
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,520
Enlivened effigies require
pure mental power.

462
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,360
I cannot love any woman.

463
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,640
Then why do you not tell Lady Chavala

464
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,040
to stay apart for some time?

465
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,440
If she continues to stay beside you,

466
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,560
your magic shall only be weakened further.

467
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,040
I cannot, my lord.

468
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,840
I wish to be happy,
as other husbands and wives do.

469
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,720
I wish to eat with her,

470
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,200
bathe with her,

471
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,320
and talk with her.

472
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,160
I wish to have her by my side

473
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,520
for every minute I have left.

474
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,800
That is my greatest wish, my lord.

475
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,240
The red cloths from Prai

476
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,120
are all over the market.

477
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,760
People are afraid to remove them.

478
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,280
Same as the authority.
They must be afraid of Prai's curse.

479
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Prai alone

480
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,360
proves to be too much for them to handle.

481
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
And there is
Taen Seenil's insurrection as well.

482
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,600
This land is full of corrupt nobles.

483
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,480
They do not care about our hardships!

484
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,720
For this matter,

485
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,600
I am being framed, my lords.

486
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Muen Vorachai, your in-law,

487
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,960
was the first to accuse me
of being a rebel.

488
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,240
And the prison breakout

489
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,560
may even be your doing.

490
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,520
But you insist that
there shall be treason in Ayothaya.

491
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,160
Perhaps you, yourself,
are plotting an uprising.

492
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,200
On the day of the breakout,

493
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,640
I led the troop in there.

494
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,800
Are you accusing me
of being a rebel as well?

495
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,680
There was no reason
for rebellion in the first place.

496
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,400
Our nation is at peace.

497
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,440
Then what of the snake cloud in the sky?

498
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,200
All of us have witnessed it that day.

499
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,480
Pansaeng can create that illusion as well.

500
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,680
More importantly,

501
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,560
no one has seen Taen Seenil for decades.

502
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,280
That could be an imposter.

503
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,120
Yet one thing is certain.

504
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,240
Prai was a senior disciple
of Khun Suriyonhassadee.

505
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,680
And for some reason,

506
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,200
he has not been able
to bring Prai to justice.

507
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,760
It is no mere coincidence, my lords.

508
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,560
Perhaps Prai Pansaeng
and Khun Suriyonhassadee

509
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,640
are joining forces
to start an insurrection.

510
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,360
I shall repeat that I am
Khun Suriyonhassadee's benefactor.

511
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,200
An accusation against him

512
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,400
is an accusation

513
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,560
of treason against me.

514
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,040
Ayothaya is administered
by six noble families

515
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,640
with equal military forces.

516
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,120
I,

517
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,960
as the Chief of the Armed Forces,

518
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,480
shall stand with those
who protect the king.

519
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,160
I wish to ask all the ministers.

520
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,600
Will you all

521
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,880
stand in solidarity with me?

522
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,960
I, the Minister of the Royal Household,
firmly stand with you

523
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,080
and his majesty the king.

524
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,080
I, the Minister of Agriculture,

525
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
and my family stand with you,

526
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,600
with his majesty the king.

527
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,920
Jaokhun, your direct inquiry

528
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,080
shall not make the rebel

529
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,280
reveal his true intention.

530
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,400
Jaokhun Amorn

531
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,800
is the father-in-law of Luang Bovorntat.

532
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,160
Jaokhun Nakorn,

533
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,120
the Minister of the Capital,

534
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,760
and Jaokhun Thammanart,

535
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,360
the Minister of the Treasury,

536
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,960
both have accepted bribes
from Luang Bovorntat.

537
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,960
Perhaps all three of you have sided
with Luang Bovorntat, my lords.

538
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,400
- Insolent!
- Insolent!

539
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,360
You have accused us.

540
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,800
Flog him!

541
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,720
My apologies, my lord.

542
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,640
I was only

543
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,000
evaluating the forces.

544
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,680
Should there be a civil war,

545
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,000
I wish to know which side

546
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,840
the six forces stand.

547
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,480
Now,

548
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,560
Jaokhun Singh has three of them,

549
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,840
and Luang Bovorntat has three as well.

550
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,600
Their forces are equal.

551
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,760
Watch your mouth!

552
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,280
I am the Chief Minister

553
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,680
chosen by his majesty the king.

554
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,120
How could I commit treason?!

555
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,040
I, the Minister of the Capital,

556
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,560
and my forces hereby

557
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,880
vow to protect the nation
of his majesty the king

558
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,680
until the day I die.

559
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,920
I,

560
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,040
the Minister of the Treasury,

561
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,560
am not a rebel

562
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,840
and have not received bribes
from any person.

563
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,160
Accuse me again,
and you shall learn your lesson.

564
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,240
I,

565
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,480
Luang Bovorntat…

566
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,920
hereby swear on my blood

567
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,320
that I am not committing treason,

568
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,360
and I shall serve his majesty the king

569
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,240
until the day I die, my lords.

570
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,440
What is wrong, Va?

571
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,760
Forgive me. I thought…

572
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,760
I thought someone was teasing me.

573
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,520
Who else could it be? It was me.

574
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,280
As a child, I remember
Mother tenderly hand-feeding Father.

575
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,880
Father acted as if the food was heavenly.

576
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,480
I, myself, wish to know

577
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,960
if it is truly that delightful.

578
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,880
‪Dear!

579
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,360
It is truly delicious.

580
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,280
All right.

581
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,840
Today was full of exhausting matters.

582
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,640
All were from the outside.

583
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,600
My home

584
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,520
is truly the most peaceful.

585
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,600
- Dear.
- Hm?

586
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,320
Today,

587
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,280
I have been appointed
as a chief customs officer

588
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,800
in place of Chai.

589
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Is that true?

590
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,920
Then you must begin your duty shortly.

591
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,040
Yes.

592
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,800
Since childhood,

593
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,960
Father has taught this duty only to Chai,

594
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,480
and I never thought
I would take this position.

595
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,440
I truly do not know

596
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,800
how to begin my duty.

597
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,040
Chief customs officer

598
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,680
is the one who collects taxes.

599
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,440
I fully trust you with collecting money,

600
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,520
since you are the best
with managing money.

601
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,720
I need not worry at all.

602
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,800
Father once told me that

603
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,960
the chief customs officer will know

604
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,920
who is dishonest
with public money. Is that true?

605
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,920
Yes.

606
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,600
Legitimate caravans

607
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,360
must have official seals on the wagons.

608
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,440
Only the chief customs officer will know

609
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,200
which seals are legal
and which ones are not.

610
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,640
Shall we embrace all night?

611
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,880
I think

612
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,880
we should only lie down and talk.

613
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,000
Shall we?

614
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,440
You have once told me

615
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,760
that mindfulness before death

616
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,120
shall help us prioritize
what is important over what is not.

617
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,920
In your life,

618
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,160
what do you deem unimportant?

619
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,440
Competition.

620
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,320
Malice.

621
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,600
Why must we win all the time?

622
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,320
We shall die one day.

623
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,120
They shall die one day.

624
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,200
Yes.

625
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,920
That is what I thought.

626
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,320
Well,

627
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,920
anger and vengeance

628
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,160
are unimportant as well.

629
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,120
I have spent my life seeking vengeance.

630
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,800
I wished to take revenge
on the one who killed my family,

631
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,320
so I learned magic to prepare for it.

632
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,080
When I finally met Saenkam,

633
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,920
I had nightmares.

634
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,480
After meeting Taen Seenil that day,

635
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,520
I was trembling.

636
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,960
I could not sleep all night.

637
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,520
It felt…

638
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,480
like my chest was burning.

639
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,200
You believe in the law.

640
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,320
That was why you stayed calm

641
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,040
and did not kill Saenkam earlier.

642
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,520
After meeting you,

643
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,200
I finally realized that vengeance

644
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,560
is one thing

645
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,160
that is unimportant as well.

646
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,160
You taught me

647
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,360
to see the flowers.

648
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,000
I now know

649
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,640
how to appreciate the flowers,

650
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,440
the stars, the wind,

651
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,240
and delicious meals.

652
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,760
These simple joys

653
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,240
are what make life meaningful.

654
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,720
Being able to know,

655
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,720
to express my love,

656
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,560
and to share the dreams with someone
who is beautiful inside and out,

657
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,160
such as you,

658
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,440
is the greatest gift of my life.

659
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,240
Dear!

660
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,240
Dear! Please hold on!

661
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,760
Dear! Take this medicine!

662
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,680
Dear!

663
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,680
<i>My dear,</i>

664
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,840
<i>why must our lives be so unfortunate?</i>

665
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,360
Trouble has arisen, sir!

666
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,080
Prai has robbed Ban Tha Din Daeng!

667
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,840
Mother! Mother! I am here!

668
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,320
Harn.

669
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,560
We must hunt them down!

670
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,560
Go.

671
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,560
They are now camping.

672
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,040
Prai has completely changed.

673
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,720
He is no longer your senior disciple!

674
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,000
We shall not face them directly.

675
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,280
This is not you at all, sir.

676
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,720
The love for your wife changed you.

677
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,120
Prai's magic is truly powerful.

678
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,960
You will not stand a chance.

679
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,360
You favor Prai even more than me.

680
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,680
You are disregarding
my vengeance against him!

681
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,000
Dear!

682
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,160
If death does us part,

683
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,440
please remember in your heart and soul

684
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,360
the truth,

685
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,880
that I love you,

686
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,480
<i>and I shall be forever by your side.</i>

687
