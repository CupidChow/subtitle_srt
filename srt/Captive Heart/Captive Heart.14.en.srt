1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
I shall pour this water

2
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,720
to prove that
these pandan leaves are consecrated.

3
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
If these pandan leaves turn black,

4
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
you must leave Lady Chavala.

5
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
Dear.

6
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,000
Is it possible that we are truly
under a love charm?

7
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,920
The wheels of karma will turn for you!

8
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
Noi has come!

9
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Noi is here?!

10
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,120
A ghost cannot report a crime, My Lord?

11
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
Yes, it cannot.

12
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
Muen Vorachai! You killed me!

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
A ghost of Noi?!

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
Jerm, you are the only one who knows

15
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,280
if it is truly her.

16
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,080
The real Noi was not from Ban Noen Sung.

17
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
She was from Khoktum.

18
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,200
She was an orphan since childhood.

19
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,080
I wish to report an offense.

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
An offense of defamation.

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,440
I hereby judge Lady Pimpilai to be guilty

22
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,440
according to the law of Ayothaya.

23
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,760
Seek out those whom Saenkam has wronged.

24
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I must make everyone realize
that the wicked man was to blame,

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,680
not my daughter!

26
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Khun Saengplarn shall help us, sir.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Muen Vorachai trembles
every time he is on trial for this matter.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,760
Va herself also suspects

29
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,200
that those pandan leaves
were truly meant to arouse her.

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Are you saying

31
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,520
that Muen Vorachai truly
did use a love charm but failed?

32
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
He killed Noi to sacrifice
her blood for a love charm.

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
Darn it!

34
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,840
O sacred beings of heaven and earth,

35
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,600
and all the spirits of my forebears,

36
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
grant this humble soul
the strength to avenge itself!

37
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,680
May karma be their judge,
if the law could not!

38
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,120
May the cruel

39
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,560
be damned to burn in a living hell!

40
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,200
Your relishes, sir.

41
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,360
Noi!

42
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
Is that you?!

43
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,320
A ghost of Noi, sir?!

44
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
You bitch!

45
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
Die!

46
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
I do not fear you! I will kill you again!

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
Noi, you must help us find your body!

48
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Let the wicked be punished

49
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,440
and suffer the same fate as you did!

50
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,200
Noi, forgive me!

51
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
I will kill you, ghost!

52
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
Please! Do not harm me!

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Let them suffer

54
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
beyond the pain you and I knew!

55
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,520
Dear.

56
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,640
Lady Pim arranged
for someone to return this to you.

57
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,280
How did you remember this?

58
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,200
Our bond was not
this strong during that time.

59
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,800
But somehow, every time I see you cry,

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,760
my heart grows tender.

61
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,840
Let me put it on for you.

62
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,440
Yes.

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Dear, I very much appreciate this.

64
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
Is this your family's sigil?

65
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,280
It is not.

66
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,560
I only know that it is truly important.

67
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,560
Father asked Chai
to keep it around his neck.

68
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,760
It may have some relevance
to being a customs officer.

69
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,040
Relevance to being a customs officer?

70
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,840
Yes.

71
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Yet Chai never wore it

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,880
and even sold it.

73
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Do you believe that…

74
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Muen Chai

75
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,440
truly cast a love charm on us?

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
I do.

77
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,880
And do you believe that he killed Noi?

78
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,120
For this matter,

79
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
I can only wish

80
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,360
that it was not him.

81
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,919
Thong!

82
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,280
Do you need my help?

83
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
I brought this cloth for you.

84
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,240
Thank you, Thong. It is truly nice.

85
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,720
I am looking for new clothes
to wear to the temple as well.

86
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,360
You have my thanks.

87
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,400
- Is he Laor's friend?
- Yes.

88
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
He comes to court Laor.

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,480
That sharp-faced bastard
still visits Laor, sir?

90
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
Do you know him?

91
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,320
Yes, sir. I have seen him before.

92
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,320
But Laor did not mention him,
so I thought he stopped seeing her.

93
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,760
I thought you had
a special affection for Laor.

94
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
You two are always close.

95
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
Uh, no, sir.

96
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,440
We consider ourselves siblings.

97
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
I teach her how to fight,

98
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,480
while she does the house chores for me.

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,480
That is our agreement.

100
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,240
It seems that this Thong is serious.

101
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,040
He visits her day and night.

102
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,720
I do think that even
an unwavering girl such as Laor

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,640
shall be wed to him in less than a year.

104
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,040
Think it through.

105
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,160
Rueang.

106
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,800
Oh? Ming?

107
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,800
Why did you return so soon?

108
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,640
I am not done cleaning.

109
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,360
You can wait for me then.

110
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
Does Thong see you at the house often?

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes, he brought me gifts.

112
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,080
Then…

113
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,560
Are you two seeing each other?

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Oh, not at all.
I still do not want a husband now.

115
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,680
If you do not want him,
you should tell him to stay away.

116
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,320
Why would I?

117
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,480
Thong always brings me nice gifts.

118
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,680
Do you know

119
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,080
that no one has brought me
such nice and valuable gifts?

120
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
Nice and valuable gifts?

121
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,400
If he puts in this much effort,

122
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
his eventual proposal

123
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,520
will leave you no choice.

124
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
Oh, we have talked about this.

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,440
You have talked to him?

126
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,360
With all these gifts you have brought me,

127
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,280
are you looking to wed me?

128
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Yes.

129
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,320
I do not think about marriage as of now,

130
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,040
but my thought may change
in one or two years.

131
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,440
What? You have been thinking
about getting married as well?

132
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,480
I have been thinking of everything.

133
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,200
Unlike you, who has
no regard for your future.

134
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,000
Saiyud told me

135
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,240
that a girl my age still has
a few years to find the right person.

136
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
So, I plan to wait for a while

137
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,200
to consider well
and look for someone wealthy.

138
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,840
Are you looking for a wealthy man?!

139
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,080
Laor,

140
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,600
are you obsessed with wealth that much?

141
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, I am a servant.

142
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,240
My future husband must be
wealthy enough to free me.

143
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,080
Do you think my child
should inherit my servanthood?

144
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,720
Oh, I do not think so.

145
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,840
You think of having a child as well?

146
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
I have been thinking of everything.

147
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,680
Every life must have a goal.

148
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
I need to plan mine as well.

149
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
And how did Thong respond?

150
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,920
Next year,
I will be appointed a squad leader,

151
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
and there will be an annuity.
A prosperous future is indeed assured.

152
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Then we shall see

153
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,840
which division you are to be assigned to.

154
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,400
We shall see
how your commanding officer is.

155
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,520
If your commanding officer is good,
I may accept your proposal.

156
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
Would you truly accept?

157
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Wait. Hold on.

158
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Why was it as easy
as shopping in the market?

159
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Why must it be difficult?

160
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,000
I am merely a child of servants.

161
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
Ming.

162
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,920
How much is the annuity
for a squad leader?

163
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,240
For a squad leader, it is not much at all.

164
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
I shall become a major by next year.

165
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,840
What? How does this concern you?

166
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,400
Well, I…

167
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,480
I…

168
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,120
Whatever!

169
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,280
Listen. I am truly disappointed in you.

170
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,200
Did you not tell me you would be
like my little sister for a long time?

171
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,120
Once you are wedded,

172
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,840
I will not have anyone to keep me company.

173
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,680
How would we practice Muay?
And who would take care of my house?

174
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,920
Oh, I will talk to my husband
regarding that. No problem at all.

175
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,280
- Talk to your husband?
- Well,

176
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
I am done with cleaning. I am leaving.

177
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
I must retrieve the shrimps from my trap.

178
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,720
Wait, what? Uh…

179
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,120
Laor.

180
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,160
I am here to see Khun Saengplarn.

181
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
This way.

182
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
Khun Saengplarn. Sir.

183
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,840
What is it, Chuang?

184
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,720
I have found my wife's body, sir.

185
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,080
Luang Athikorn has one nephew
who is a drunkard.

186
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,560
He only causes trouble and does no work.

187
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,280
And he constantly
asks his uncle for money.

188
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,600
A while ago, when Phin,
my wife, disappeared,

189
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,560
this man has been seeing
Luang Athikorn more and more.

190
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
Go away! Leave at once!

191
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,000
You have been threatening me too much!

192
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
I do not fear you!

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,200
I only asked for some money.

194
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
Did you not hear me?! Leave!

195
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
Do not ever show your face again!
Go, you bastard!

196
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,600
<i>I saw them arguing,</i>

197
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,080
<i>but I did not hear what it was about.</i>
<i>I only heard the loud yelling.</i>

198
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Then, I followed Terd.

199
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,520
He stays in the abandoned
monk's house of Wat Tabaek.

200
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,120
<i>I had recalled something,</i>

201
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,640
<i>so I went to the cemetery</i>
<i>behind the temple.</i>

202
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,400
Why did you think
of looking in the cemetery?

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you believe that

204
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,480
Terd was hired by Luang Athikorn
to kill your wife?

205
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,400
Yes, sir. To extract a large amount
of blood out of the victim,

206
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,600
the killer would need some time.

207
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,040
That was why he killed her
in the cemetery, to bury her right away.

208
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
Why did I not think of this?

209
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,680
So, I asked the undertaker
if he saw something strange

210
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,200
during the last few months.

211
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,000
And he led me to dig up a corpse.

212
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,280
I found my wife's body.

213
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
There is a knife mark on the neck bone.

214
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,920
Her throat must have been slit,

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
killing her instantly.

216
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,040
Phin.

217
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,920
She passed without suffering,
did she not, sir?

218
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,120
She did not. She may not even be aware.

219
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,360
It was the best way to extract
the most blood from the body.

220
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,040
And how can you be sure
this is your wife's body?

221
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,280
The remaining garments.

222
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,240
She had woven them herself.

223
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,800
I could not bring myself
to tell anyone but you.

224
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Good.

225
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,079
Good judgment.

226
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,800
Luang Athikorn
was once in the military force.

227
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
He is cunning.

228
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,560
We shall need a thorough plan

229
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,160
to ensure the prosecution
of Luang and Saenkam.

230
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,560
Shall we not report this crime now?

231
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
Not yet.

232
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,400
Use some hay to conceal this body.
Do not let anybody see it.

233
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,960
Ask for the undertaker's help
to keep this a secret.

234
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,600
Yes, sir.

235
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Dear.

236
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,680
What are you doing?

237
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,640
Does it feel good?

238
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,280
It truly does feel good.

239
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,360
Massaging here

240
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,240
shall ease your back pain.

241
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,920
Doing it here

242
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,680
shall ease your neck's stiffness.

243
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
What about this?

244
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,480
This shall arouse physical desire.

245
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,680
Dear.

246
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,400
What is it you are saying?

247
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
If I am

248
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,480
successful in capturing Saenkam,

249
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,960
please let me stay in this house with you.

250
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,680
Saenkam is no ordinary shaman.

251
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,920
He was once a mere lackey of Taen Seenil.

252
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,920
He took the lives of my parents

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,120
and my sister.

254
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,760
Is that true?

255
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,960
I remember him.

256
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,400
His habit of raping women
has stuck with him since he was a thief.

257
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,000
If he is such a vile soul,

258
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,480
execution is what he deserves.

259
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,240
Dear.

260
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,280
Will you truly be able to capture him?

261
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,440
We have found the body of Phin,
Chuang's wife.

262
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
It shall not be difficult now.

263
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,040
Really?

264
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,080
I was at the temple this morning
and saw Luang Athikorn as well.

265
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
How is he doing?

266
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,480
Well,

267
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,600
he went as far
as killing one of his servants

268
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,720
to offer the blood
to that disgusting plant.

269
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,240
And look what he got in return.

270
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,040
His son was doing better for a few weeks

271
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,880
and has now become frail again.

272
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,760
A vile soul such as Saenkam does not
possess the merits to cure anyone.

273
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Should all go as planned, in ten days,

274
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,560
we shall lie together.

275
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,960
- Dear.
- Huh?

276
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,960
What is it you are talking about?

277
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,680
You can count the days. Only ten days.

278
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,560
I shall bid farewell

279
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
to the cold raft house.

280
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,480
Why is it

281
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,800
that you are so certain?

282
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,720
Terd. Terd.

283
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,920
I have palm wine.

284
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,360
Come with me. There are snacks as well.

285
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,120
Good?

286
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,000
Wait, dear. Is that not Chuang?

287
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,640
Why is he with Terd?

288
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,360
What are they talking about?

289
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,720
No, dear. We must not be too hasty.

290
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,240
There are people here.

291
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,680
Let us go.

292
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
Very well.

293
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,160
These are all fine treats.

294
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,520
Why are you sharing this with me?

295
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,440
I told you I only want company.

296
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,600
Terd. Terd.

297
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,120
Are you acquainted with Luang Athikorn?

298
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,280
I saw you argue with him the other day.

299
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,560
What was it about?

300
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,160
My uncle is incredibly stingy!

301
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,680
He refused to pay me
for what I did for him.

302
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,000
What task did you do for him?

303
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,920
I cannot tell you. It is a secret.

304
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,880
Terd.

305
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,360
Hey, Terd. What is that secret?

306
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,160
- Go away.
- Terd!

307
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,560
Let me sleep.

308
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
Terd did not slip up?

309
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,600
Does that mean your plan failed?

310
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,520
You seem enthusiastic

311
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
about bringing Saenkam to justice now.

312
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,920
Come here.

313
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,800
- Dear…
- Come. Come here.

314
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,040
Come here. Come.

315
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,440
The raft house

316
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
does not smell as nice as this house.

317
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,760
The perfume you gave me

318
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,440
is merely an imitation.

319
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,160
It is not as fragrant

320
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,640
and warm as you.

321
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,080
No, dear.

322
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,880
We shall speak of this no more.

323
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,560
I shall leave now.

324
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,880
I shall continue with the plan then.

325
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
What is next, dear?

326
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
But you must come here first.

327
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,440
Come.

328
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
You can tell me the plan if you wish.

329
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,960
If not, you can keep it to yourself.

330
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,440
Are you selling well?

331
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
I shall return to you.

332
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,720
Saiyud. Yesterday, Khun Saengplarn's men

333
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
found a buried body
of a woman at Wat Tabaek.

334
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,720
A woman's body? Who is she?

335
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,240
Her throat has been slit as well.

336
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,600
It is most horrible.

337
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,120
Khun Saengplarn said that there was a case

338
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,280
where a man reported to the authorities
that his wife had been missing.

339
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,440
He must have taken that man

340
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
to identify his wife's body by now.

341
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,800
What did she do
to deserve such a brutal death?

342
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,440
Khun Saengplarn also said

343
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,920
that the truth shall be unveiled
in only a few days.

344
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,520
The body is full of evidence,

345
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,320
and the place of murder is clear.

346
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,000
The murderer will surely be captured then.

347
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,440
Terd, die!

348
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,680
Wait. I surrender.
I surrender! I surrender!

349
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,840
- Remove his mask.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,000
Uncle? Did you intend to kill me?

351
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,920
Phin's body has been found.

352
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,080
So, he intended to silence you, Terd.

353
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,680
- Phin's body?!
- Terd!

354
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,760
- Do not say anything! Silence!
- Hey!

355
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Laor.

356
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,880
What are you doing?

357
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,320
Khun Saengplarn told me
to start moving his clothes here.

358
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,520
He said he will spend
the night here tomorrow.

359
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,760
You should stop being shocked
and prepare yourself, Va.

360
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,000
Please excuse me.

361
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,800
Laor.

362
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,560
You should indeed prepare yourself.

363
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,320
Tomorrow

364
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,320
will mark ten days,

365
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,040
exactly as I have told you.

366
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,960
Have you successfully

367
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,480
captured Luang Athikorn?

368
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,800
I shall go to the court of the Ministry
of the Royal Household tomorrow.

369
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,240
If Luang Athikorn admits his crime,

370
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,000
Saenkam shall be found guilty as well.

371
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,120
Let us conclude

372
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,200
that I have managed to defeat Saenkam

373
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,160
as I promised.

374
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,080
Then, what if…

375
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,000
What if Luang Athikorn does not confess

376
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,120
and Saenkam denies your accusation?

377
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,200
I have studied governance for my mother
and martial arts for my father.

378
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,000
But I most favor the art of strategy.

379
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,440
I have planned everything.

380
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,000
No one

381
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
shall escape my grasp.

382
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,960
Dear.

383
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,640
Dear, you have always been
a master schemer since I met you.

384
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
You planned this nonsense as well.

385
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,400
And what if I do not agree
to lie with you?

386
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,960
What will you do?

387
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,160
If the lady rejects me…

388
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,360
then I must…

389
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,320
Dear! Dear.

390
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,840
You must leave at once.

391
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,840
But this is my bedroom.

392
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,640
- Va.
- Dear!

393
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,800
My Lord. Have you heard the news?

394
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,480
Luang Athikorn
will be on trial today, My Lord.

395
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,480
Saenkam is most greedy.

396
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,520
Was he not so obsessed with money
and fame, this would not happen.

397
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,160
Will it be connected to me, My Lord?

398
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,000
I have sent my men to observe.

399
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,800
And you,

400
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
do not show yourself around the trial.

401
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,200
Stay put.

402
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
I have been working for you.

403
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,680
- And I killed someone for you--
- You!

404
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,160
If I am to be captured,

405
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,560
please help me, My Lord.

406
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,800
Fine.

407
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,600
You gave me your word.

408
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,560
Please do not let them imprison me.

409
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,240
Yes! You have my word.

410
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Luang Athikorn.

411
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Why did you make
an attempt upon Terd's life?

412
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
He has been threatening me
for money at my own house, My Lord.

413
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,280
Everyone knows about this.

414
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
Is it the truth, Terd?

415
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
I…

416
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
Luang Athikorn

417
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,000
hired Terd to slit
the throat of my wife, Phin,

418
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,560
to offer her blood to the plant given
to him by Master Saenkam, My Lord.

419
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,400
Is it true, Terd?

420
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,320
No, My Lord.

421
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,440
I did not kill Phin.
I do not know anything.

422
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,360
I am Terd's uncle.

423
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,520
We have had minor disputes.

424
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Henceforth, I shall cease
all acquaintance with him.

425
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,080
I regret what I have done.

426
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,960
Please judge me
for only a petty offense, My Lord.

427
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,720
Should this case be closed,

428
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,520
Luang Athikorn shall go unpunished.

429
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,440
What about your life, Terd?

430
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,040
Khun Saengplarn.
This does not concern you.

431
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,480
How long do you wish to flee from him?

432
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,040
Where do you wish to flee to?

433
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Are you content with drinking
and sleeping anywhere as you did

434
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,520
now that you realize
he would try to silence you any day?

435
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,600
Terd.

436
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,800
I am your uncle. Why would I kill you?

437
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,239
Think it through!

438
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,280
You were trying to kill me
last night. It is obvious.

439
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,280
I request to present
the next witness, My Lord.

440
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,400
He is the undertaker of Wat Tabaek,

441
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,000
who pointed me to the spot
where Phin was buried.

442
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,520
My Lord, my name is Singh.

443
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,920
What did you witness?

444
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,080
He has come to support my statement.

445
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,560
Singh, describe all you witnessed.

446
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,000
Two months ago, I saw Terd

447
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,760
doing something suspicious
in the cemetery.

448
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,120
Then, after a careful recollection,

449
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,520
I found that the time matches
the age of Phin's corpse.

450
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,360
Given this witness's statement,

451
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,160
will you confess
to the deed of Phin's demise?

452
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,160
I…

453
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,600
Hey. Look at me. You are my nephew.

454
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
The murderer shall be
imprisoned for 20 years.

455
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,400
But your confession
shall halve your sentence.

456
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,600
And if you were not the mastermind,

457
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,640
you shall face five years of punishment.

458
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,640
And Luang Athikorn shall be
sentenced to 20 years in prison.

459
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
The royal prison is a terrible place.

460
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,240
No one has ever survived
more than 20 years inside.

461
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,440
If you wish to feel safe,

462
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,920
the one to spend 20 years in prison

463
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,560
must be Luang Athikorn.

464
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,680
Then I wish to confess, My Lord.

465
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,880
I was the one who killed Phin
by Luang Athikorn's order.

466
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,640
No! It is not true!

467
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,600
I did no such thing! He is framing me!
You ungrateful nephew!

468
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,080
Why would I kill Phin

469
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,960
when I did not even know her?!

470
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,400
Luang Athikorn commanded me to.

471
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,120
He told me to extract
fresh blood from Phin

472
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,600
to water the plant from Master Saenkam.

473
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,960
Why must it be the blood?

474
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,880
He wished for his son
to recover from illness.

475
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,280
His son has been frail
for many years, My Lord.

476
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,000
That plant is still
at Luang Athikorn's house.

477
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,680
You may observe it, My Lord.

478
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,160
There are still bloodstains
around that plant.

479
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,440
Luang Athikorn. Will you confess?

480
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,320
It was not my doing. It was not my doing.

481
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
I will confess, My Lord.

482
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,040
I will confess.

483
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,200
My son!

484
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,560
- What are you saying?! Stop at once!
- No, my son.

485
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,920
It was my fault.

486
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I have been unwell.

487
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,920
Please forgive my father, My Lord.

488
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Phin has died.

489
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,040
And I have not recovered.

490
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,200
Phin died because of me.

491
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,240
That vile shaman has fooled us all.

492
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,720
Chuang.

493
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,120
Forgive me.

494
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Please forgive me.

495
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,080
The witness and evidence are clear.

496
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,080
I hereby judge Luang Athikorn

497
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,040
to be guilty of masterminding murder.

498
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
You shall serve 20 years in prison.

499
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,760
And you, Terd.

500
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,920
You have confessed
and provided helpful testimony.

501
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
Yet you were despicable enough

502
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,240
to take a stranger's life for profit.

503
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,280
Hence, I hereby sentence you

504
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,600
to ten years in prison.

505
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,840
Ten years?! Did you not say five years?!

506
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,320
Khun Saengplarn!

507
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,280
You tricked me and Terd!

508
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,440
Is this your plan all along?!

509
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,200
Phin, my dear.

510
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,880
I did it.

511
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,400
You shall rest peacefully now.

512
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,240
Oh, dear.

513
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,600
This case still has
one more accomplice, My Lord.

514
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,040
He was the one who manipulated
Luang Athikorn into killing a person.

515
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,800
My Lord, I request

516
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,120
to open a new case

517
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,160
to bring Master Saenkam to justice.

518
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
Very well. I am to open a new case.

519
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,600
We shall prosecute Saenkam.

520
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,960
Bring him in for a trial tomorrow.

521
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,200
The soldiers are coming
to capture you! You must flee!

522
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,360
I am not fleeing! I did no wrong!

523
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,040
Luang Athikorn was the murderer!

524
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,400
What he said was right, My Lord.

525
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,160
He merely suggested it to Luang Athikorn.

526
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,440
No one was reckless enough
to do what Luang Athikorn did.

527
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,720
Do not forget the failed amoria bloom!

528
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,200
Muen Vorachai has been on two trials now.

529
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,760
Lady Pimpilai and Pansaeng

530
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,600
are both looking for evidence to prosecute
us! You must flee while you can!

531
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,800
I am sick and tired
of being a forest bandit!

532
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,080
Then you shall be imprisoned!

533
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
I will not! I have helped you!

534
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,200
I have helped our master!

535
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,480
You shall not ditch me so easily!

536
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,360
Do not ever dare blame me!

537
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,360
You have been drinking and raping
enough to lose your magic!

538
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,560
You have brought this upon yourself!

539
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,520
You!

540
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,800
Cease your temper towards him!

541
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,280
Your magic is now nothing
compared to his. Remember!

542
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,240
We shall wait and see what our lackeys do.

543
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,680
They shall buy us time.

544
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,320
What lackeys?

545
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,320
Do you all want these leaves?

546
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,360
- I do!
- I want them!

547
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
- I want the leaves!
- Please give me!

548
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,200
Take them!

549
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,000
Take them all!

550
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
Take them!

551
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,720
- I have it now!
- Take more!

552
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
I have it!

553
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Here!

554
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,200
- That is mine!
- No, it is mine!

555
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,840
- I have one!
- What?

556
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,480
- Huh?
- Why are they here?

557
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,560
State your business.

558
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,880
We are ordered to bring Saenkam on trial!

559
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,920
- What?!
- On trial?

560
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,240
Have you all heard that?!

561
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,640
These people are disrespectful enough

562
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,560
to call our master only by name.

563
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,280
You all must protect our master

564
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,400
by pushing them away!

565
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Leave at once! Our master
has done nothing wrong!

566
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,320
You must not capture him!

567
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,960
- What did you say?!
- Go away!

568
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,640
Do not harm our master!
He was falsely accused! Go!

569
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
- Let us drive them out!
- Go away!

570
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,560
- Get out! Go away!
- Go! Go away!

571
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,240
- Get out! Get out!
- Leave at once!

572
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,240
- Go away! Go!
- Get out! Go away!

573
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,640
- Go away! Go!
- Get out! Get out!

574
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,840
- Get out!
- Go! Get out!

575
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,320
- Go away! Out!
- Get out! Get out!

576
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,720
- Out! Get out!
- Get out! Go!

577
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,680
- Leave Master alone!
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

578
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,880
We soldiers are forbidden
by law to harm civilians.

579
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,120
That is why we must
retreat for now, My Lord.

580
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
Then you are to go after dark,
when everyone disperses.

581
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,720
We have already tried, My Lord.

582
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,200
But they were camping there
and refused to move.

583
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,720
They are blocking the way in and out.

584
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,160
These followers of the shaman

585
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,840
are truly ignorant.

586
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,920
Then, we shall wait.

587
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,800
- Yes, My Lord.
- Yes, My Lord.

588
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,120
Chuang has won the case, my lady.

589
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,040
I am now truly more hopeful.

590
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,840
As of late, I have been asking
the undertakers in many temples.

591
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,000
Some day, we shall hear about Noi.

592
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,040
Saenkam still refuses to be captured now.

593
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,280
But if more cases emerge,
we shall have more hope, my lady.

594
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,240
I heard Khun Saengplarn let you gather
those who were wronged by Saenkam.

595
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,480
Does it fare well, Aon?

596
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,760
It goes fairly well,

597
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,120
but most are intimidated
by Luang Bovorntat, who is supporting him.

598
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,440
We must encourage them. We have
hope now, and they should speak up.

599
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,120
I light incense and tell Noi every day

600
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,600
that Muen Chai shall get what he deserves.

601
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,600
Forgive me, my lady.

602
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
I understand, Jerm.

603
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,480
Whether Chai truly killed Noi or not,

604
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,280
I shall make peace with it.

605
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,680
The truth shall always be the truth.

606
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,280
What is this area called?

607
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,520
Wat Heeplat cemetery, sir.

608
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,760
How could I have forgotten this
until now? What a fool I am.

609
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,400
I think I know

610
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,880
where Noi's body is.

611
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,560
What?

612
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,760
Muen Vorachai again?

613
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,720
This is the third time!

614
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,920
This time, Khun Saengplarn has requested
the soldiers to witness the exhumation.

615
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,440
We have found Noi's body, My Lord.

616
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,800
It is not her ghost,
but her corpse this time.

617
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,360
Noi… Noi, my dear wife.

618
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,400
Jerm.

619
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,640
Compose yourself…

620
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,200
and look for anything unusual.

621
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Yes, sir…

622
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,840
Noi.

623
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,280
This is me.

624
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,240
Loosen your grip for me.

625
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,800
This does not belong to Noi, sir.

626
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,880
This watch bears the engraved initial

627
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,800
of Praya Ratanathipok, your father.

628
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,800
No.

629
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,040
I did not know of such a thing.

630
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,960
These servants are the witnesses

631
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,560
who confirmed that this watch is one
of a kind and belonged to Jaokhun Rat!

632
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,200
It was stolen.
I do not know when I lost it.

633
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,440
It was not my doing, My Lord.

634
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,000
Enough with the lies!

635
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,760
Noi, who has been killed,

636
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,600
was holding this watch in her hand!

637
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,120
I have been framed, My Lord.

638
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,920
These servants are framing me!

639
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,840
Answer me. Did any of you

640
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,080
see me killing Noi?

641
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,360
Anyone? Did you?!

642
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,920
I request to present Ngiam,
the witness, My Lord.

643
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,000
Forgive me,

644
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,240
Khun Saengplarn. Greetings, sir.

645
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,680
I practice white magic.

646
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,200
I had never conjured any spirits before

647
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,800
until my first time

648
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,960
with the ghost of Noi.

649
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,280
On a boat ride through the river,

650
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,920
I saw the ghost of Noi.

651
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,680
I do not wish to listen
to such a scary tale, sir.

652
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,560
I saw her with my own two eyes.

653
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,120
If the ghost of Noi could not haunt
Muen Vorachai into confessing his crime,

654
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,440
she will surely come for his accomplice,

655
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,080
such as you.

656
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
What did you witness?

657
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,760
Muen Vorachai… Uh, Muen…

658
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,800
Speak up!

659
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,640
Yes, My Lord! Muen Vorachai

660
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,880
ordered me to lure Noi
onto a boat, My Lord.

661
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,160
Why did she have to be on a boat?

662
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,920
Uh, to… to…

663
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,520
To be killed

664
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,440
and have her blood used
for the plant, My Lord.

665
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,640
Ngiam! You are framing me!

666
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,080
Are you now confessing

667
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,840
that you lured Noi to Muen Vorachai?

668
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,920
Yes, but I did not kill her, My Lord!

669
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,320
I only brought her to him.

670
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,760
I do not know anything else.
I have told all, My Lord.

671
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,320
Please let me go! I beg you! Please!

672
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,080
The witness and evidence are clear.

673
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,040
I hereby judge Muen Vorachai to be guilty

674
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,000
of the murder of Noi.

675
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,360
The sentence is execution!

676
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,600
However, with his
past duties for our nation,

677
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,880
his sentence shall be lessened
to 20 years imprisonment!

678
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,640
Va.

679
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,400
Dear.

680
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,720
Tell me it is not true.

681
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,520
Soldiers!

682
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,920
Put him in prison!

683
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,360
Uh… Luang Bovorntat.

684
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,040
You promised you would help me.

685
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,200
If you ditch me, I will expose you.

686
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,640
Luang Bovorntat was the mastermind.

687
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,840
He commanded me to kill Noi

688
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,080
because he is planning

689
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,640
an insurrection.

690
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,680
Insolent!

691
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,720
What insurrection?
That is a baseless accusation!

692
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,200
Pansaeng has thwarted
your plan to smuggle weapons.

693
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,200
That was the reason
Luang Bovorntat commanded me

694
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,760
and Saenkam

695
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,160
to cast a love charm on my own sister.

696
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,640
He knew Pansaeng could not take a wife.

697
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,640
If he did,

698
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
his magic would fade away.

699
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,240
My Lord.

700
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,360
This mad dog is desperate.

701
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,240
He is now distracting us with lies.

702
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,320
It has been common knowledge

703
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,280
that Pansaeng and he
have held a grudge for a long time.

704
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,600
He only wishes to make
the court and all of us

705
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,040
confused!

706
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,160
It is merely trickery.

707
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,720
No, My Lord. The person
who wishes to kill Pansaeng

708
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,440
is Luang Bovorntat! It is you, not me!

709
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,480
Stop at once, Muen Vorachai!

710
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,640
You are disrespecting
a high-ranking noble with your accusation!

711
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,480
Flog him ten times
before his imprisonment!

712
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,320
No, no. I shall not be imprisoned!

713
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,280
Luang Bovorntat
has used me for his bidding!

714
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,200
Let go of me!
He will start an insurrection!

715
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,240
- Chai!
- Let go of me!

716
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,200
- Chai!
- Va.

717
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
- Va. Va, help me!
- Chai!

718
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,560
- Va! Let me go! Let me go!
- Chai! Chai!

719
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,160
- Chai!
- Va.

720
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,640
You achieved nothing for me,
yet you dare expose me.

721
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,920
May your end come
in prison in a mere week.

722
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,520
Dear. Dear…

723
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,680
Is it true,

724
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,880
as people say, that no one would survive
more than eight years in prison?

725
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,400
Even the citizens of Ayothaya
are now struggling to get by.

726
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,360
You cannot imagine
what it is like in prison, Va.

727
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,920
Grandfather and Father

728
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
were praised by all.

729
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,040
The honesty of our house
was held in high esteem.

730
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,400
- But at last, our names are flawed.
- No, no.

731
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,840
Listen.

732
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,240
You have done your best.

733
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,840
You warned him. You tried to stop him.

734
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,120
Dear.

735
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,320
What can we do?

736
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,960
Can we bring food, drink, or medicine,

737
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,840
- or even a blanket to him?
- Yes, we can.

738
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,400
We shall do our best.

739
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,280
Muen Chai shall probably survive
longer than others.

740
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,920
But now, you must not lose your strength.

741
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,480
You must rest well tonight.

742
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,640
I shall go to the prayer hall.

743
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,840
You go to sleep.

744
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,080
Yes.

745
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,240
Chai.

746
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,000
I brought some food for you.

747
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,880
I do not wish to see your face, Chavala.

748
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,840
But I shall visit you every day.

749
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,240
You must eat and sleep.
You must survive, brother.

750
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,520
My life is in ruin because of you.

751
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,240
Is this what your heart desires?
You now have my house

752
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,640
and all my servants.
Is this what you wished for?

753
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,320
I have had no one but you,
and now you have no one but me.

754
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,080
Because you are the only one I have,

755
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,760
I grew furious when you took
the side of the man who stole my position!

756
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,160
Put your mind at ease,
so you do not lose your strength.

757
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,360
Eat something.

758
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,800
Had you helped me
get rid of Pansaeng that day,

759
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,960
I would not suffer this fate.

760
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,520
But you

761
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,920
decided to love him

762
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,880
and joined him in prosecuting me!

763
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,880
Look into my eyes.

764
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,480
If I were to die the next day or two,

765
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,040
it will all be because of you.

766
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,560
You are killing me. You betrayed me!
You are killing me!

767
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,400
Chai.

768
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,080
Eat something.

769
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,560
- Eat it all.
- Go away.

770
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,320
Leave at once.

771
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Leave at once! Go!

772
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,600
Leave me alone!
You traitor! You wicked sister!

773
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,240
I said leave me alone!

774
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,080
Saenkam!

775
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,720
- Capture him!
- Capture him!

776
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,880
- Capture him!
- Capture him!

777
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,560
If any of you wish to be
rammed in the guts,

778
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,640
then try me.

779
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,760
This Saenkam shall only bring

780
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,720
destruction to anyone who supports him!

781
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,120
And if our Master
comes to help us tomorrow,

782
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,840
the three of us shall kill him!

783
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,760
The same goes
for all these people behind me.

784
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,600
They are overflowing
with hatred and anger,

785
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,560
enough to destroy you many times over!

786
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,000
You shall face me today.

787
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,960
A life of power

788
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,040
or death surrounded by love.

789
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,320
