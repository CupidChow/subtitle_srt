1
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,160
Die, Aon!

2
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,680
I shall tell of every wound
they have endured.

3
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,160
Who cast this magic upon you?!

4
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,040
Their craft is most uncommon!

5
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Saenkam. You are much more skilled.

6
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,080
You are worthy of greatness
alongside Taen Seenil.

7
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,320
What shall you let Aon do?

8
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,160
He shall sell goods in the market.

9
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,560
- I can do it.
- I shall rent a shop for you.

10
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,000
- Here.
- Here, My Lady.

11
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,360
She does not like
Khanom chan, sir. Sampannee

12
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,240
is her favorite. Then,

13
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,640
- Foi thong!
- Foi thong!

14
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
<i>Some people</i>

15
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,600
can wound the hearts of others
without need of weapons or sorcery.

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
<i>This yantra shall suppress</i>
<i>Pansaeng's curse.</i>

17
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,240
From now, that buffalo hide
shall not pain you again.

18
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,200
He shall not be able
to harm me again, shall he?

19
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,520
I have a task for you.

20
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
This is yours, Saiyud.

21
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,960
Why are you giving us this money, sir?

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,080
A token of apology.

23
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
For the way I mistreated you all.

24
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
I shall not hurt any of you again.

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
You have my word.

26
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Shall you truly be able to do it?

27
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,520
You always forget
your words when you're angry.

28
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,960
You!

29
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
I shall try!

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Now, all of you.

31
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,400
Will you serve me once more?

32
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,279
I shall go and apologize to Va

33
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,920
and bring Aon home.

34
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,480
Are you satisfied?

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,400
I truly want to change my ways.

36
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
Show me some sympathy.

37
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Here.

38
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,160
This is yours.

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
Here. This is yours.

40
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
What happened, Ngiam?

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Muen Vorachai went to the shaman
to remove the curse,

42
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
but it was unsuccessful.

43
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,400
He must have made peace with it.

44
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,360
Perhaps he knows
it is time to change his ways.

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
- Ngiam.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Help me put it away.

47
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,600
Then we must hide it well

48
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,400
before he changes his mind.

49
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Shall we go?

50
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Go.

51
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,200
Let us go.

52
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,640
And you must pretend to be good
and enter Pansaeng's house.

53
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Must I pretend
to have changed my ways, My Lord?

54
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,440
Yes.

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,000
I have a task for you.

56
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,520
These are the urns of Father and Mother.
Do you not remember, Va?

57
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,160
I hereby swear to be a better man

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,200
and change my ways.

59
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
I shall cease my impulsiveness
and my violence towards others,

60
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Father and Mother.

61
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,680
You are only pretending, and trying

62
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,040
to convince me to ask Khun Saengplarn
to remove the curse, are you not?

63
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,720
Not at all, Va.

64
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,200
Well,

65
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,800
I was reflecting
on the teachings of our parents.

66
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,760
Did they not wish for me to be a good man?

67
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,760
I have truly changed, Va.

68
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,520
You claim to have changed,
and now I am to trust your words?

69
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
Perhaps it is all too easy.

70
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,280
A portion of my wealth
has been given to Saiyud and others.

71
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,400
Laor's parents as well.

72
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
I did this to atone.

73
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
I truly want everyone to forgive me.

74
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
No.

75
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,240
You must return home
and prove yourself to me first.

76
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
You there.

77
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
What are you doing?

78
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,360
A ghost! A ghost!

79
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,320
Do not harm me!

80
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
I am afraid! Please do not harm me!

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,560
- I am afraid! Please back away!
- Who is that?

82
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,120
Laor.

83
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,080
Please do not harm me! Do not possess me!

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
- I am afraid!
- Ngiam? Ngiam!

85
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,800
Tian. What is happening?

86
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,760
He wandered around the house,

87
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
and when I questioned his actions,

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,680
he started yelling nonsense, My Lady.

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
What were you doing up here?

90
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,320
I was searching
for Muen Vorachai, My Lady.

91
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,120
And is this the spirit child
that Khun Saengplarn keeps?

92
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Tian is but a boy. He favors this outfit.

93
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Is he truly a human?!

94
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,160
And Chai is outside, not in here.

95
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,520
Khun Saengplarn does not wish
for anyone to enter his house.

96
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Do not ever let yourself in again.

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,440
Yes, My Lady. I shall remember it.

98
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,240
You did this again, Tian.

99
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,280
Well, did you scare him?

100
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Perhaps I went too far.

101
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,840
Did you fail to do what I asked?

102
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Forgive me, sir.

103
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,920
Please do not punish me.

104
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,160
I shall do whatever you command me to,

105
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
but please keep me away
from Khun Saengplarn, sir.

106
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,800
You coward!

107
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
I have carried it out myself!

108
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,200
Please do not harm me! I am afraid!

109
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
Laor.

110
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,360
Is my life fated
to follow the same path as yours,

111
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,560
Prai?

112
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,880
Your meal, sir.
There is sugarcane juice as well.

113
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
There is a letter to you, sir.

114
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,840
<i>"Silent anger and hatred</i>
<i>resemble severed ties,</i>

115
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,440
<i>offering no chance for me to mend them."</i>

116
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,480
I bear no anger nor hatred toward you.

117
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Do you wish for me
to carry that message to Va?

118
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
Do not bother.

119
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,280
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Then I shall go and practice Muay, sir.

121
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,560
Where does the music come from?

122
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
What a truly beautiful sound.

123
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,120
But why does it sound familiar?

124
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
I do not despise you.

125
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
On the contrary…

126
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,840
My Lady. My Lady.

127
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,720
Since destiny has not bound you two,

128
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
please accept this
and find peace, my child.

129
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,760
How could Pansaeng
come to love such a woman?

130
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,200
I do not understand.

131
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,520
Do Pansaeng and Lady Chavala

132
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,280
truly love one another?

133
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,400
Their love even caused
the house to shake, My Lord.

134
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,320
If Pansaeng's love is genuine,

135
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,120
then the rumor
is certainly false, my dear.

136
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,920
What rumor?

137
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Father. Mother.

138
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,200
It is said among the military

139
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,360
that Pansaeng and Prai, the bandit,
studied magic under the same master.

140
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,480
This school forbids
any attachments to women.

141
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,120
Please tell me more.

142
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,840
<i>Ten years ago,</i>
<i>Prai was a thieving sorcerer.</i>

143
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
<i>The spiritual items he consecrated</i>

144
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,960
<i>were sought after by all.</i>

145
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,120
<i>Hundreds of men</i>

146
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,120
<i>begged to study under him.</i>

147
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,760
<i>Prai</i>

148
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,760
- <i>assumed control of a vast den of thieves.</i>
- Prai. Here.

149
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,720
- This way, please.
- Me too, Prai.

150
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,280
- Prai.
- Here, Prai!

151
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,000
- Wait!
- In the back as well.

152
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
- Prai.
- Further this way, Prai.

153
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,560
Prai, give me.

154
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,760
<i>Prai had never</i>
<i>involved himself with women.</i>

155
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,680
<i>One day, he was weakened</i>

156
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,560
<i>upon meeting a woman named Aunruean.</i>

157
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,960
<i>Their bond grew intimate.</i>

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,520
<i>Then, both Prai and Aunruean disappeared.</i>

159
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,280
<i>They longed for a simple life,</i>

160
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,400
<i>so they settled in a small house</i>

161
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,680
<i>among the mountains in Lavo.</i>

162
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,880
<i>One day, the villagers found them,</i>

163
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,160
<i>and a fight ensued.</i>

164
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,200
- You!
- Prai!

165
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
Is this truly the legendary Prai?!

166
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,640
Aunruean!

167
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,840
His magic faded
because he fell in love with a woman?

168
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,120
The news of his diminished prowess
reached the authorities.

169
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,320
The soldiers then
surrounded him to capture him.

170
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
And was he captured, My Lord?

171
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Both of them were brought
to the capital's prison.

172
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,280
I was the judge in that trial.

173
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
Then, the sentence
must have been execution.

174
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Yes.

175
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,760
I did visit them
the day before the execution.

176
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,320
My Lord. Please help me.

177
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,040
My wife

178
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,920
became severely ill.

179
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
You shall be executed tomorrow.

180
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,280
Do you have any final wishes?

181
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,320
Aunruean never stole from

182
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,040
nor harmed anyone.

183
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,360
She has committed no crimes.

184
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,120
Please let her go, My Lord.

185
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,960
Many harbor thoughts of revenge upon you.

186
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,320
You have taken their kin from them.

187
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,440
Do you truly believe that Prai's wife
shall survive outside of prison?

188
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,640
I beg of you.

189
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,520
Could you please

190
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,960
bring the doctor to treat her illness?

191
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,320
Keeping her alive shall suffice.

192
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,360
Fine.

193
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,160
If any doctor is willing to treat the wife
of an infamous outlaw such as yourself.

194
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,160
You have my deepest gratitude, My Lord.

195
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,320
Your mercy shone even on a vile bandit.

196
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,720
You truly are the kindest.

197
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,720
That day, I witnessed

198
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,120
the depth of their love for one another.

199
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,800
Love is truly frightening.

200
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,640
They were willing
to forsake all, even their lives,

201
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,320
for the sake of love
and to remain together.

202
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,440
Then why has Prai still not been executed?

203
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,880
He is now wielding his magic
to rob and kill once more.

204
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,920
The next day,
while being sent to the executioner…

205
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,560
- Go!
- Go to your death!

206
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,240
- Go away! Go!
- Die!

207
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,560
- Go!
- Go away!

208
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,800
- To your death!
- Go!

209
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,680
- Go away!
- We are not afraid of you!

210
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,240
Go! Go away!

211
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,080
I love you.

212
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,280
Farewell.

213
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,920
<i>Aunruean passed away in prison.</i>

214
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,080
<i>Prai, despite his illness,</i>
<i>did something terrible.</i>

215
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
Once Aunruean died,

216
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,680
did his magic return?

217
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,240
Yes.

218
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,080
Prai managed to escape,

219
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,960
and his magic was restored.

220
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,480
If Pansaeng has mastered
the same magic as Prai's,

221
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,520
he shall not be able to love.

222
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,960
He shall lose his power

223
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,600
and even meet his end.

224
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,800
I heard that Pansaeng's enemies

225
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,320
sent women to seduce him many times.

226
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Lady Chavala is one of them, My Lady.

227
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,880
Muen Vorachai
lost the rank of Khun to him,

228
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,720
and he must have been furious.

229
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,960
In that moment, I could not help

230
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,160
but think that they were truly in love.

231
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,720
Yet, sometimes it seems that
they are pretending only to infuriate me.

232
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,280
Panseang and Lady Chavala

233
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,600
truly confuse me.

234
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Greetings, My Lord.

235
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,240
I have retrieved the belongings
of Pansaeng and Chavala.

236
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,760
What shall you do next?

237
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,560
I shall undertake a great task.

238
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,640
Is it truly suitable
for me to be in the woods

239
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,440
where people pass through?

240
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,920
Very well.

241
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
I shall find you a new abode.

242
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,400
I desire a most exquisite house
by the river,

243
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,320
ten servants, and three meals a day.

244
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,480
And liquor as well.

245
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,680
I must have my payment as well,

246
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,360
since I serve Master Saenkam.

247
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,360
Fine!

248
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,880
What of me, My Lord?

249
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,480
I had exhausted all my wealth

250
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,000
by giving it all to the servants.

251
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,360
Shall you not show me mercy?

252
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,840
You have my thanks.

253
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
From now,

254
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,320
I shall sleep
in a proper bed as others do.

255
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,320
And I shall drive all the villagers out

256
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,440
to work only for noblemen

257
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,680
or wealthy merchants. That way,

258
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,440
we shall become rich, Master.

259
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,200
We shall not only be rich.

260
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,040
I shall become the minister
and rule this nation.

261
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,080
Then I wish to be a Luang, Master.

262
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,840
Then I will surely be called Jaokun.

263
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,040
I grow weary of these parasites.

264
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,560
They are nothing but insolent and rude.

265
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,560
How dare they
equate themselves with my kind?

266
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,400
Patience, My Lord.

267
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,200
Once you ascend to the throne of Ayothaya,

268
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,120
we shall rid ourselves of them.

269
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
This is the magical

270
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,880
amoria bloom.

271
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,320
It is merely an ordinary plant.

272
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,200
Amoria bloom shall not grow

273
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,400
without a sacrifice.

274
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,720
Must the offerings be fresh blood?

275
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,040
To bind two in carnal desire,

276
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,880
the fresh blood of a lifeless
pregnant woman is required.

277
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Where would you find one?

278
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,920
Must we kill a person?

279
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,880
Yes.

280
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,440
Originally,
the duty of making Pansaeng fall in love

281
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,000
with Lady Chavala and lose his magic
was yours.

282
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,560
But you never succeeded,

283
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,120
even after I offered you ample rewards.

284
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,960
Do you wish for me
to kill someone, My Lord?

285
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,400
How many months pregnant is Noi now?

286
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Six or seven months, sir.
Why did you wish to know?

287
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,080
Find a way to lure her

288
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,320
to the cemetery of Wat Heeplat

289
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,360
and slit her throat with a knife.

290
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
I must kill Noi, sir?!

291
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,440
Yes.

292
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,880
Am I not mistaken?

293
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,560
You did not mean it, did you?

294
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,600
What shall I gain from this atrocity, sir?

295
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,120
I shall give you 20 Hun of gold
if you succeed.

296
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,480
No, sir.
I could not bring myself to do it.

297
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
Ngiam!

298
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,400
Useless! Ngiam!

299
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,600
How long have you been here?

300
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,800
I have missed the old cow dearly

301
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
and have come
to visit Saiyud and the others.

302
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
You are here to probe me, perhaps.

303
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,480
I told you I have truly changed my ways.

304
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,200
Jerm and others confirmed that as well.

305
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,640
They said that you are behaving
yourself really well lately.

306
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,080
Would you care to stay for dinner?

307
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
Although,

308
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,800
we have no meal prepared,

309
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,400
merely morsels for drink.

310
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,160
Brother, I also wish
to speak with you about this.

311
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,040
If you truly wish
for Khun Saengplarn to lift the curse,

312
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
merely ceasing
your tyranny shall not suffice.

313
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,200
You must refrain from drinking liquor.

314
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,120
Could you return to righteousness
and fulfill your duty?

315
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,680
Must I stop drinking?

316
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,880
When we were young,

317
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,240
we would recite an oath

318
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,320
before the stupas
of our ancestors each year.

319
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
Do you remember?

320
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,880
Our clan has served
as nobles for generations

321
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
and has never brought
disgrace upon itself.

322
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
We are here before our ancestors,

323
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,000
so pledge your oath, my children.

324
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,760
Ready your prayer stance.

325
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,720
Repeat my words.

326
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
I shall be a good person,

327
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,080
putting the welfare of others

328
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,240
before my own.

329
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,560
- I shall be a good person,
- I shall be a good person,

330
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,600
- putting the welfare of others
- putting the welfare of others

331
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,080
- before my own.
- before my own.

332
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,880
I shall be the servant of this land

333
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,360
and uphold the well-being of its people.

334
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,000
- I shall be the servant of this land
- I shall be the servant of this land

335
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,880
- and uphold the well-being of its people.
- and uphold the well-being of its people.

336
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,760
My dream

337
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,720
is to see you
commit yourself to that oath.

338
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,880
Quitting drinking

339
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,720
and returning to duty

340
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,320
shall rid me of the curse?

341
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,760
I am certain

342
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,320
Khun Saengplarn would agree to lift it.

343
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,400
Fine. I shall try.

344
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,720
Your words

345
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,280
have already made me happy.

346
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,840
Do as you said.

347
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,320
For Father and Mother.

348
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,000
What is wrong, My Lady?

349
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
Saiyud.

350
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,280
If someone

351
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,520
is angry with us

352
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,680
but does not tell us
what they are angry about,

353
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
what are we to do?

354
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,880
Who is it you are talking about?

355
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,960
It is Khun Saengplarn.

356
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,040
He is ever-changing, with moods that rise
and fall. I cannot seem to please him.

357
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,840
With great love,

358
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,920
our hearts shall be fragile.

359
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Once the heart fractures,
you must tend to it.

360
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,480
Keep tending to his heart, My Lady.

361
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,520
With great love? I…

362
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,840
I am overjoyed

363
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,160
that he loves you,

364
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,960
and you love him.

365
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,000
Perhaps, in no time,

366
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,440
I shall raise my little masters.

367
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,760
Saiyud, it is not what you think.

368
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,760
He would never…

369
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,640
Well, he said that we would
live together as siblings.

370
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,960
And you think you can live such a life?

371
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,040
Your meal, sir.

372
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,520
What is it you are looking at?

373
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,640
Va told me to keep watch
while you have your meal, sir.

374
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
Shall you have it now, sir?

375
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
What is the point?

376
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,360
If you refuse to eat,
I am told to hand you this letter.

377
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,560
<i>"Carry on with your anger and hatred.</i>
<i>I am through.</i>

378
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,840
<i>But you must still eat and drink."</i>

379
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,880
Keep it.

380
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,040
In this life, we may not
be destined to be together.

381
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,600
Perhaps, all we can do
is wish each other well.

382
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,360
My Lady…

383
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,680
Tian.

384
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,440
You scared me!

385
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,440
Why does your voice
get more drawn-out each day?

386
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,080
Perhaps I truly am a spirit child

387
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,560
conjured by Khun Saengplarn.

388
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
Do you truly believe so, My Lady?

389
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,320
Have you lost your mind?

390
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,000
Well, what of your parents
in another town?

391
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,200
Are they krahang and krasue, then?

392
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,520
No.

393
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,800
They are angel and heavenly maiden.

394
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,160
Tian.

395
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,080
Is a person in this neighborhood

396
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,440
a musician?

397
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,320
No, My Lady.

398
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,760
But I heard the fiddle sound.

399
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,160
It was beautifully played.

400
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
The only person
in this area who plays fiddle

401
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,960
is Khun Saengplarn, My Lady.

402
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,320
Khun Saengplarn?

403
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,440
During normal days,
you should sell durable everyday wares,

404
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,800
such as bowls and jars.

405
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,320
They can be sold anytime, but offer
little profit as everyone sells them.

406
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,040
So, we must have a second plan, My Lady?

407
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,640
Yes. The goods for special occasions,

408
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,080
such as bathing garments for monks.

409
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,600
You must buy them cheap

410
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,120
and sell when the time is right.

411
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,080
You truly have a head for business.

412
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,880
Well, what of the third plan?

413
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,920
What yields the most profit
with the least effort

414
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,760
are goods from foreign merchants.

415
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,760
Lady Va, long time no see.
Are you doing well?

416
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,240
Oh, I am doing well.

417
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,200
What of your family? Are they not here?

418
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,560
No, they stay home for today.

419
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,840
What is this?

420
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
They are special incense sticks.

421
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,680
Special incense sticks?

422
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,560
Care to buy any accessory?

423
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,000
This one suits Lady Va.

424
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
And this will look good on Saiyud.

425
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,240
They are one fuang each.

426
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,560
Two of them shall cost two fuang.

427
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Perhaps I can only buy one.

428
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
Which one?

429
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,920
The smell is pungent. What are they for?

430
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
They can arouse physical desire.

431
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,400
Light it before bed, and your husband
shall become spirited to have children.

432
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,440
Are you not interested?

433
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
- No, thank you.
- All right.

434
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,280
Noi! Noi! Noi!

435
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,520
- What is it, Ngiam?
- Muen Vorachai

436
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,080
told Jerm to dig up bamboo shoots,
and a snake bit him!

437
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,680
Jerm was bitten by a snake?!

438
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,200
Yes! Hurry! Get in the boat with me!

439
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,080
How is Jerm? Is he badly hurt?!

440
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,440
Someone has helped him!
I shall take you there! Come!

441
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,400
Yes, yes.

442
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,800
Is Jerm safe?

443
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,440
Someone has helped him,
but I do not know how he is now.

444
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,360
<i>Our clan</i>

445
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,920
<i>has served as nobles for generations.</i>

446
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,560
We are here before our ancestors,

447
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,800
so pledge your oath, my children.

448
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,480
I shall be a good person,

449
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,440
putting the welfare of others

450
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,240
before my own.

451
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,760
What?! It is most difficult!

452
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,040
Am I supposed to be
an enlightened Arahant?

453
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,800
I am merely a human, Father!

454
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,160
It is not difficult, Chai.
We shall be like Father and Mother.

455
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,480
It is a difficult life

456
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,840
to be born into this clan.

457
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,040
You must do it,
no matter how difficult it is.

458
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,440
Repeat my words at once.

459
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,880
- I shall be a good person, putting
- I shall be a good person, putting

460
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,760
- the welfare of others before my own.
- the welfare of others before my own.

461
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,240
I shall be the servant of this land

462
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,400
and uphold the well-being of its citizens.

463
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,480
Are servants of the land civil servants?

464
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,240
I do not wish to do it!

465
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,360
You do not wish to do anything good.

466
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,640
Will you live your life
only caring about cockfighting?

467
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,960
You unworthy son.

468
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,440
Chai.

469
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,600
Your father is angry now.

470
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,840
Pledge your oath,
so your father shall forgive you.

471
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
- I shall be the servant of this land
- I shall be the servant of this land

472
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,720
- and uphold the well-being of its people.
- and uphold the well-being of its people.

473
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,960
<i>Father, Mother, you made me feel</i>

474
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,520
<i>that if I</i>

475
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,960
<i>do not live the life</i>
<i>you have expected of me,</i>

476
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,080
<i>I am not worthy of being your child.</i>

477
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
Get off on this dock.

478
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,000
What is this place? Why is it this quiet?

479
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,960
Hurry up.

480
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,440
Jerm is right there.
Someone has helped him! Go!

481
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,000
Yes.

482
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
Jerm!

483
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,440
Jerm!

484
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,800
Jerm!

485
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,800
Jerm!

486
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,840
I am Jerm's wife. Where is he now?

487
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,880
Let me go…

488
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,360
Come here! Come!

489
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,040
Muen Vorachai.

490
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,720
What is it you intend to do to me, sir?

491
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,600
I have taken your parents in,

492
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,880
and I took care of you.

493
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,840
Your life is mine.

494
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,520
<i>Om.</i> With this magic,

495
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,520
I shall conjure the amoria bloom.

496
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,960
You shall forget who your parents are.

497
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,760
You shall forget all your duties.

498
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,360
You shall cry out in anguish.

499
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,520
Nothing shall break your bond.

500
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,000
You shall be consumed by lust

501
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,520
burning in your chest!

502
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,320
<i>Om.</i> With this magic,

503
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,360
I shall conjure the amoria bloom.

504
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,320
Pansaeng shall fall deeply for Chavala.

505
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,360
<i>He shall yearn for her and desire her.</i>

506
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,120
<i>He shall beg to be with her.</i>

507
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,040
<i>He shall lie with her.</i>
<i>He shall madly crave her.</i>

508
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,400
No power shall protect him from my magic.

509
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,040
He shall long for nothing but her.

510
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,080
<i>Om. Sawaha.</i>

511
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,240
Noi! Where are you?!

512
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,120
Noi!

513
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,200
Noi, where are you?!

514
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,960
Noi!

515
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,160
Noi!

516
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Noi!

517
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,640
Noi!

518
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,600
Where are you?!

519
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,040
Va! Va!

520
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,640
- Chai.
- Va.

521
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,400
Noi has been missing for three days.

522
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,120
Noi? What happened?

523
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,520
The servants suspected that

524
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,720
she went into the woods
to find the nourishing herbs.

525
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,920
With your belly that heavy,
why must you go, Noi?

526
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,040
I am asking for you
and your people's help finding her.

527
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,160
Certainly.

528
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,000
Tian! Laor!

529
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Where are they?

530
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,480
Tian! Laor!

531
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,240
Where are you?! Come help me!

532
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,400
- Noi!
- Noi!

533
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,320
- Noi!
- Noi!

534
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,160
- Noi!
- Noi! Where are you?!

535
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,080
- Noi!
- Noi!

536
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,000
Noi!

537
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,200
- Noi!
- Noi!

538
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,000
- Noi!
- Noi!

539
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,600
- Noi!
- Noi!

540
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,120
Noi!

541
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,040
Noi!

542
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,960
Where are you, Noi?!

543
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,400
- Noi!
- Noi!

544
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,520
Noi!

545
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,760
Noi!

546
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
- Noi!
- Noi!

547
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,480
- Noi!
- Noi!

548
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,400
Noi!

549
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,160
- Noi!
- Noi!

550
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,960
- Noi!
- Noi!

551
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,560
- Jerm!
- Jerm!

552
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,280
You must stay strong!

553
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,480
Noi! Where could you be?!

554
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,800
Aon.

555
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,800
I want to die!

556
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,360
Jerm.

557
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,080
Why must she leave me by myself?

558
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,600
Noi…

559
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,000
Amoria blooms look identical to pandans

560
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,480
that Chavala uses to brew tea every day.

561
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,160
Tomorrow, I shall lure everyone
out of the house.

562
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,360
Your duty

563
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,160
is to plant amoria blooms
in place of pandans.

564
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,200
<i>Once they drink the tea,</i>

565
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,160
<i>our plan shall succeed.</i>

566
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,320
And is there no letter today?

567
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,280
Va went to the market yesterday
and did not return home last night.

568
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,240
What? She has not returned until now?

569
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,080
Yes, sir. The rain was pouring all night.

570
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,640
With such rain,
no boat was able to travel the river.

571
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,840
Your lady has gone missing,
and yet you remain so unmoved, Laor?!

572
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,000
- Sir.
- What is happening, sir?!

573
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,360
Sir!

574
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,280
What was that, Laor?

575
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,000
Va was at the market,

576
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,800
and people were walking around all night.
How could there be any danger?

577
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,960
Aon was there as well.

578
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,000
He regards Aon as the danger.

579
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,760
Is he jealous?

580
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,440
Yes, he is!

581
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,520
This one, My Lady?

582
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,240
Traitor!

583
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,000
- Dear.
- Sir.

584
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,120
After all I have done for you!

585
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,440
Dear…

586
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,760
Was it so pleasant
to spend the night together?!

587
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,640
Dear.

588
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,600
The rain was pouring last night.
The storm--

589
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,840
With so many people in the market,
how could you two be so intimate?!

590
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,920
You humiliated me, Aon!

591
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,120
Intimate? We did not do such thing, sir.

592
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,760
I now realize what adulterers look like!

593
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,200
Are you scolding me, dear?

594
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,640
I did not do anything wrong.

595
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,840
Do not ever show your face again,

596
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,720
or I shall kill you!

597
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,840
Dear…

598
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,320
You, come here.

599
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,640
- Come here!
- Dear! What is this?

600
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,080
Dear. Dear.

601
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,600
Dear. Stop.

602
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,240
Dear, please stop!

603
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,880
Do you truly think Aon and I
have committed adultery?

604
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,040
I did no such thing.
It was all just your assumptions.

605
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,840
Yes! It must be all in my head!

606
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,800
And who made me assume that?

607
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,160
The wind was too strong yesterday.

608
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,080
No one would take their boats out.
That is why I did not return home.

609
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,640
Then why did you not return
before the storm?!

610
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,520
I had to arrange the goods
and make the list!

611
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,440
Could Aon not do anything by himself?!

612
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,280
Has your recent resentment toward me

613
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,560
stemmed from jealousy?

614
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,040
Jealousy?

615
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
You were the one who betrayed my trust!

616
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,040
No. Come here. We shall return home!

617
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,440
Dear! Please wait!

618
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,560
Dear!

619
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
From now on,
do not go to the market again.

620
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,080
You shall only stay home.
Do you understand?

621
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,200
Sir, this may help you feel better.

622
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,720
Last night,

623
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,520
during the storm, many people
were there to keep their goods dry.

624
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,520
You can ask them yourself.

625
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,840
I was a fool
to have welcomed you into my life!

626
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,600
It was arrogant of me
to think I was in control,

627
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,800
but I could not control anything!

628
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,560
It was all because of you!

629
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,840
Sir!

630
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,640
You are a monster! You are the devil!

631
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,120
You have ruined my life.

632
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,000
You have destroyed my focus,
and I could not do any work!

633
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,400
What is wrong with you?!
Why are you always frustrated?!

634
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,280
My heart is now burning,

635
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,040
but my body is burning hotter.

636
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,800
Sir.

637
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,120
What are you doing?

638
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,520
It hurts. Please let me go. Let go!

639
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,720
Being far from you is painful!

640
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,640
Being near you is also painful.

641
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,320
But if I am

642
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,000
this close to you, how would it feel?

643
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,440
Sir! Sir!

644
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,160
Sir! You are not this kind of person!

645
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,320
Sir!

646
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,520
Sir!

647
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,200
Perhaps this is who I truly am!

648
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,120
What you did

649
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,360
was no different
than what Chai did to Saiyud.

650
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,320
He never asked her

651
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,040
nor sought her consent.

652
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,200
He only imposed himself upon her!

653
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,760
I hate this feeling.

654
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,000
And I most despise a person such as this!

655
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,160
I…

656
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,880
How could you become this monster?!

657
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,600
How could you do this to me?

658
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,440
<i>I gave this magic to you.</i>

659
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,920
<i>Protect it with your life.</i>

660
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,160
<i>If one day you are consumed by lust</i>

661
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,600
- <i>and let yourself be entangled with women,</i>
- Sir!

662
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,040
- <i>may every bone in your body</i>
- Sir! Sir!

663
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,520
- <i>shatter.</i>
- Sir!

664
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,680
- <i>May your every muscle</i>
- Sir!

665
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,320
- <i>burn like fire.</i>
- Sir!

666
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,480
- <i>May your spirit be torn</i>
- What is happening to you?!

667
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,680
- <i>and descend into hellfire.</i>
- Sir!

668
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,200
Sir!

669
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,720
Sir! Sir!

670
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,400
You must remain unharmed!

671
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,800
Is there anyone outside?! Help me!

672
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,920
Sir! Sir!

673
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,680
Sir! Sir!

674
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,040
Sir! Sir!

675
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,040
Sir.

676
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,800
Is anyone there?!

677
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,000
Pansaeng is surely
facing illness from amoria bloom.

678
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,080
He shall die without our effort.

679
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,280
How long shall it be?

680
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,480
Master! Please come out and help me!

681
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,040
My wife has been missing
for ten days, Master.

682
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,200
She is long dead.

683
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,600
Perhaps we should visit Noi's grandmother

684
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,560
to see if Noi is there with her.

685
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,160
Does the house spirit follow you, My Lady?

686
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,160
Saiyud! Do not scare me.

687
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,680
Aon! What was that?

688
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,520
I do not know, My Lady.

689
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,520
- Hey!
- Sir, why are you here?

690
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,560
Did you secretly board the boat with us?

691
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,320
I would never betray you, Khun Saengplarn.

692
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,360
Do you truly bear no affection for Aon?

693
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,640
