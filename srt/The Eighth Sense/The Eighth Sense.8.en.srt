1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,487
There is a line in "Hedwig" that goes like this.

2
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:08,549
"It is clear that I must find my other half.

3
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:12,227
I have to find my other half.

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:15,531
What does this person look like?

5
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:16,991
Are they identical to me?

6
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:18,684
Or do they look the opposite from me?

7
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,580
Does my other half have what I don't?"

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,822
Wow, what a show.

9
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:26,601
- Isn't it too much for a Liberal Arts class assignment?
- The movie "Hedwig"

10
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:31,554
talks about human nature and its fundamental desires.

11
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:37,592
- Is he having a pre-Halloween party by himself?
- How can we become our true selves?

12
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:44,632
And in the end, is it possible to find your true self?

13
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,874
Well done.

14
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:53,210
Next, group number 8?

15
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:57,623
Ji Hyun, you went through a lot.

16
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:59,183
Are you okay now?

17
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:03,018
Yes, Professor, thanks to you. Thank you.

18
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,680
You're welcome.

19
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:13,664
We will start our presentation.

20
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:20,525
The movie we chose is director Park Chan Wook's 2006 work, "I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK."

21
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,926
The art direction in the movie, "I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK"

22
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:29,788
was done by director Ryu Seong Hee, who also worked on the team since the movie "Old Boy."

23
00:01:31,816 --> 00:01:34,994
Young Goon, who believes she is a cyborg in the movie,

24
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:38,922
throws a question at herself.

25
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:44,200
"I still don't know what my usage is.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,463
Why was I created?"

27
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:50,009
Through the portrayal of a colorful psychiatric hospital

28
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,912
we can conclude that the message from the art director was the following:

29
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,919
Psychiatric hospitals don't always have to be gloomy.

30
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,232
It's okay to be colorful.

31
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:09,011
Even if you are a cyborg, it's okay not to eat.

32
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:13,436
Adam and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib,

33
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:20,756
can both live the way they want to live.

34
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,500
Thank you for listening.

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,103
Ji Hyun, you got into a big accident,

36
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,564
but group 8 did well.

37
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:40,701
That's all for today.

38
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,745
Class dismissed.

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,231
Thank you very much.

40
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,983
You did well.

41
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:49,502
Are you feeling okay?

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,795
- Walk carefully.
- Stop it.

43
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:54,398
One step at a time. Oh, my!

44
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,750
What is it?

45
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,252
Did you see my presentation? You saw what I did, right?

46
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:02,038
You guys failed big time.

47
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:06,969
You should walk straight to Itaewon in what you're wearing.

48
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,581
I saw the Professor giving you a B minus.

49
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:13,659
Who gets lower than 3.0 for an elective liberal arts class?

50
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,227
I'm fine with it.

51
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:19,247
It's okay to be a cyborg, and it's okay to get a B minus.

52
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,152
Will you move?

53
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:27,597
Hey, Ji Hyun.

54
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:30,033
Will you eat with me, please?

55
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,753
Enjoy it alone.

56
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,889
Enjoy your meal all by yourself.

57
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:35,865
Bon appetit.

58
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,683
Hey, Kim Ji Hyun!

59
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,377
Kim Ji Hyun, you've changed!

<i>[The Eighth Sense]</i>

68
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,114
The seniors were so petty,

69
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:52,399
complaining about the club's pending approval and canceled trip.

70
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,930
We, freshmen, have to stick together, right?

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,877
Seriously? You couldn't say a word in there.

72
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:06,605
Hey, when someone's overreacting and the other one does the same, it becomes funny.

73
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,493
I thought she was throwing a one-person show.

74
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:14,596
"Sunbae, you know what happened to Ji Hyun!"

75
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:19,251
It's a relief, though. We were worried about you.

76
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,353
Thank you.

77
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:24,964
But I thought you didn't like me.

78
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:27,275
It's not that I didn't like you.

79
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,619
I just wasn't interested.

80
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:31,513
It's different.

81
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:34,582
Now that I survived, you're suddenly interested in me?

82
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:36,694
Come on, what's wrong with you?

83
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:39,588
Super proud of you, my Ji Hyun!

84
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,556
"My Ji Hyun?" Since when is he your Ji Hyun?

85
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,110
And you are my Bit Na.

86
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,754
Open your mouth. Good girl.

87
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,660
Is it good?

88
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,478
He doesn't look so good.

89
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,164
I heard the Disciplinary Committee opens today.

90
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:27,371
- Is it today?
- Yes.

91
00:06:27,371 --> 00:06:32,632
Shouldn't we have to go and say hi to the seniors?

92
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:36,552
It's fine. We see them every day.

93
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,513
Let's just ignore them.

94
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,247
Hey, Park Tae Hyung.

95
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,243
Are you really not going to forgive Jae Won?

96
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:54,194
No. I won't.

97
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm the victim here.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,944
You know Jae Won's been going through a tough time!

99
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,550
Honestly, he took care of you so many times.

100
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,145
Can't you let it slide this once?

101
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:13,570
No one told him to take it out on me!

102
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:18,228
I'm going to push for his suspension.

103
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,899
Hey, Park Tae Hyung!

104
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:33,952
Will you be okay?

105
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,421
Yes.

106
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:40,391
I'll put in a good word for you.

107
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,786
But I'm not the best public speaker.

108
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:47,189
It's okay. You don't have to try so hard.

109
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:55,380
We will now begin the Disciplinary Committee for the on-campus assault by Seo Jae Won.

110
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,203
The victim Park Tae Hyung, please make your statement first.

111
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:06,209
I entered the school the same year as Seo Jae Won

112
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:11,114
and spent the last six years together as friends.

113
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:16,034
On the day of the assault, I was just doing my job as the TA.

114
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:19,481
But Seo Jae Won assaulted me when I didn't do anything.

115
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,458
I'm an obvious victim.

116
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,582
Are you willing to forgive him, Park Tae Hyung?

117
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:32,252
To stop the repeat and, I believe school violence should be eradicated.

118
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,110
Therefore, I have no intention of forgiving Seo Jae Won.

119
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,601
That's all for my statement.

120
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,225
Seo Jae Won, please make your statement.

121
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,226
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:04,096
I have no excuse for my actions, and everything was all my fault.

123
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:10,504
I want to express a sincere apology to Park Tae Hyung once again.

124
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:13,835
Also, I will accept any decision

125
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:18,406
made by the Disciplinary Committee without any objection.

126
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,125
That's all.

127
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,551
Ji Hyun, why are you here?

128
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,004
Sunbaenim, I will speak as the witness on behalf of our club.

129
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,546
What?

130
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,566
I'm not sure about that.

131
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:50,395
I became famous in school as someone who almost died right after I started school.

132
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,949
I also have my statement ready.

133
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,194
Do you think it'll be okay?

134
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,157
I don't know. I think I'm too nervous to speak well anyway.

135
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,475
Okay, you do it then.

136
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,140
The witness, on behalf of the club, Kang Yoon Won, please come in.

137
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:21,836
Hello, I'm a freshman, Kim Ji Hyun.

138
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:26,892
Before I start, I want to make it clear

139
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:31,869
that I have no intention to defend the violence of Seo Jae Won.

140
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,710
However...

141
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,770
I would like to share his everyday behavior at the club.

142
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,902
Many freshmen feel like loners

143
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:50,139
when moving to Seoul from the countryside for school.

144
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,868
I was one of them.

145
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,945
The aggressor, Seo Jae Won,

146
00:10:55,945 --> 00:11:01,806
was a very nice senior and the first person to reach out to me

147
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:06,237
when I felt like the odd man out of the countryside.

148
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:11,091
With his help, I no longer fear Seoul,

149
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,738
college is no longer scary,

150
00:11:14,982 --> 00:11:17,441
and I don't feel alone.

151
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,894
That's how I felt.

152
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,648
In our club, Seo Jae Won is

153
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:28,775
an exemplary senior who cares for everyone.

154
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,826
And as you all may already know,

155
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:42,081
recently, Seo Jae Won had to witness an accident that almost cost me my life.

156
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,437
As far as I know,

157
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:50,655
Park Tae Hyung made a remark that mocked my accident.

158
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,335
Therefore, this is an unpleasant case for me as well.

159
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,310
Therefore, I hope all of you in the Disciplinary Committee

160
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,980
will take all circumstances into account and make a wise decision.

161
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,134
How did it go?

162
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,677
Can you believe it?

163
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,771
I'm sure his dad bailed him out again!

164
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:48,926
How did it go, Oppa?

165
00:12:48,926 --> 00:12:50,811
I got 50 hours of community service.

166
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,680
What a relief.

167
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,059
I was worried that you were going to get suspended from school!

168
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,852
Let's go get some food.

169
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,804
It's on me today.

170
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,173
Wait, where's Ji Hyun?

171
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,474
<i>[You must be exhausted today.]</i>

172
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:22,990
<i>[Get a good rest.]</i>

173
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:30,530
<i>[You must be exhausted today.]
[Get a good rest.]</i>

174
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,186
Hey!

175
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,539
I knew it. Look at these texts.

176
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:36,932
"I miss you."

177
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,059
"Why aren't you answering?"

178
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,228
I knew you had a girl.

179
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,749
Shall we sit down for a second?

180
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:16,094
You saw who I sent those texts to, right?

181
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,076
I actually...

182
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,138
have a crush on someone.

183
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:30,009
However...

184
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:33,087
that person is not a girl

185
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,416
but a guy.

186
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,565
Are you surprised?

187
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,473
What's the deal with you?

188
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,346
I said, what's the deal with you!

189
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,382
Weird, right?

190
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:07,063
This is so upsetting.

191
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,994
That's not what I'm saying.

192
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:18,407
I don't care if you like girls or boys.

193
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:19,177
What?

194
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:23,130
How can you keep this big news from your friend of 13 years?

195
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,473
I-I'm sorry.

196
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,461
Oh, my goodness. It's big news!

197
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,822
I can't believe Kim Ji Hyun is finally seeing someone!

198
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,982
Is it for real?

199
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,318
Yes, it's for real.

200
00:15:41,265 --> 00:15:44,292
It's crazy!

201
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,654
What is he like?

202
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:50,648
He's a good person.

203
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,575
Tell me more.

204
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:59,605
He wants to be seen as a strong person, but has a lot of wounds.

205
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:02,043
And I want to heal his wounds.

206
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,954
I see now why you went on a trip with him.

207
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:08,941
No wonder why he looked super worried at the hospital.

208
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:14,736
I wondered why someone who you just met was overly worried about you.

209
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,166
Did he worry about me that much?

210
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,593
Don't even mention it.

211
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,070
Someone actually died next to you in the ICU.

212
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,881
And he suffered more than the dead patient's family.

213
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,867
Don't make fun of him like that.

214
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,752
He was just worried.

215
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:30,221
But why is he avoiding your calls?

216
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,000
I have no idea.

217
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,411
Maybe he's scared.

218
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,237
Why?

219
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:41,457
Because he got into a relationship with me.

220
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,609
He might be confused.

221
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,695
How about you?

222
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:50,208
I'm confused too.

223
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:55,303
Then there was the accident.

224
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:57,848
So he may not be in a good state of mind.

225
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:00,251
I'm trying to understand him.

226
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,422
So what now?

227
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,313
I'll have him back.

228
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:14,109
But isn't he back together with that glamorous girl from the surf club?

229
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:17,430
So I'm saying I'll have him back.

230
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:22,947
Wow, love-struck Kim Ji Hyun is super aggressive.

231
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:25,176
But also pretty cool.

232
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,999
Does anyone else know about this?

233
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,936
Ae Ri knows a little.

234
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,157
I'm super disappointed.

235
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,243
I can't believe someone else knew before I did.

236
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:44,763
Maybe because she's a Seoul kid, she catches things so fast.

237
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,397
That's why.

238
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:51,653
That means Ae Ri and I are sharing a secret, right?

239
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,937
What?

240
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:54,447
I'm going to get closer to her now.

241
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:59,335
That means I can be friends with Bit Na and the people with the acting major.

242
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,214
Don't be ridiculous.

243
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,510
Now I feel like I'm in college.

244
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,150
<i>The person you call is not available. This call will be forwarded to the voicemail after the beep—</i>

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,612
<i>[Hyung. I know you're reading my messages.]</i>

246
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,256
<i>[Good night.]</i>

247
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:52,034
<i>[Let's talk soon.]</i>

248
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,458
<i>[Ji Hyun: Hyung. I know you're reading my messages.]</i>

249
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,326
<i>[Ji Hyun: Good night.]</i>

250
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:48,570
<i>[Ji Hyun: Let's talk soon.]</i>

251
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:06,295
What are you doing here when you go to the art school?

252
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:10,199
I'm an art student who's just drawing. Is there something wrong with that?

253
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:17,356
It must be hard to catch up after being in the hospital.

254
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:21,077
My friends are helping me. So, I'm okay.

255
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,613
You seem to always be with the same group of people.

256
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:29,712
That nerdy boy and that rude freshman girl.

257
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:33,597
I didn't know you cared about me so much.

258
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:35,641
Well, thanks.

259
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,080
You sound sarcastic.

260
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640
Not at all. How could I?

261
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,308
You are above me, like the sky.

262
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:50,189
Jae Won Oppa and I are supposed to meet up for the assignment, but he's late.

263
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:55,553
You mean the group assignment that you became the same group with him by drawing the straws, right?

264
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,481
That's not true.

265
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,500
Jae Won begged me to work with him.

266
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,695
That's not what he told me.

267
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,910
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

268
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,070
You know some motels around here since you work at the restaurant in this area, right?

269
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,507
I wonder where Jae Won and I should sleep tonight.

270
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:22,011
You heard the news, right? We got back together.

271
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,449
I don't know the history between you two.

272
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:28,652
So I don't know if 'got back together' is the right word.

273
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:31,991
I need to hear both sides of the story.

274
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,768
Hey, if I say I'm dating him again, then that's it.

275
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,829
Who are you to judge?

276
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,585
It's you, right?

277
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:48,647
The one who's spreading weird rumors about Jae Won and me.

278
00:21:56,016 --> 00:22:01,327
You think you are so mature now that you're a legal adult, aren't you?

279
00:22:01,327 --> 00:22:03,829
You're still a baby.

280
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:07,675
What's the benefit for me when there's a weird rumor about you two?

281
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:11,337
You're intentionally confusing him so that he'll stay next to you.

282
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,664
It's an obvious trick.

283
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:16,550
You are slower than I thought.

284
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,479
You are asking for a fight, right?

285
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,117
Sure, let's fight.

286
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:28,796
I enjoy a fair fight.

287
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:32,925
Sure, go ahead.

288
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:35,936
Excuse me. I need to go to work.

289
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:41,981
Oh, by the way, my boss at the restaurant wanted to say thank you.

290
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:43,411
What?

291
00:22:43,411 --> 00:22:46,748
The story you shared online

292
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,701
actually helped her bring in more customers.

293
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,495
She said, "Please come by again," and she'd give you out a lot of things on the house.

294
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,190
Is that old lady out of her mind?

295
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,120
Come with Jae Won tonight.

296
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,189
I will take good care of you.

297
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,991
Goodbye.

298
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:10,313
Jae Won won't even try to go there.

299
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:13,391
He never even mentioned you after that big accident.

300
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,068
You are out of his interest.

301
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:28,279
- That looks delicious.
- That looks delicious.

302
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,450
This is a special treat for you guys.

303
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:36,304
But you never listen to me, do you? I told you that you don't have to work.

304
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:38,883
Well, how was work today?

305
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:43,956
It felt good to finally move around and feel alive again.

306
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,658
What? You already feel alive because you are in love.

307
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,844
Seriously?

308
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:53,689
Are you in love?

309
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,809
Okay, all right.

310
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:01,195
You guys did well today. Cheers!

311
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,696
- Boss.
- Yes?

312
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:11,331
Have you been in love?

313
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:14,235
Look at this boy mocking a divorcee.

314
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,755
Of course, I've been in love.

315
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:24,531
Can you teach me how to win someone you love?

316
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,301
Kids these days play hard to get and stuff,

317
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,969
but back in my days, there was no such thing.

318
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,580
Do you want to win love?

319
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,018
Then just go for it.

320
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,778
That's how you get it, right?

321
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:44,973
I really want the love back.

322
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:47,930
But that person's avoiding me, so I don't know what to do.

323
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,842
I worry that we might grow apart.

324
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:57,336
That's the moment when you push harder.

325
00:24:57,336 --> 00:25:00,922
Kids these days have a lot of fears. What are you afraid of?

326
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:04,285
This is why the birth rate is so low,

327
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,287
and people don't get married anymore.

328
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,723
People are full of fear.

329
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,108
- Boss.
- Yes?

330
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,668
You sound a bit Geriatric.

331
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:14,177
What did you say?

332
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:17,913
Listen up. What I'm trying to say, as an older sister,

333
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,226
is always be honest,

334
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:21,611
be straightforward,

335
00:25:21,611 --> 00:25:24,605
and express your feelings as it is.

336
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,366
Do you get it?

337
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:28,868
Stop just thinking about it.

338
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:32,831
You have to do something to get something.

339
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:36,291
That way, you can live a great and fun life.

340
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,686
Let's live a fun life.

341
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:41,339
Let's live an honest life, okay?

342
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,873
- Yes!
- Good. Cheers to that.

343
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,968
Bottoms up, you kiddos.

344
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,302
Hyung.

345
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:15,990
Hyung.

346
00:26:18,401 --> 00:26:19,927
Let's talk.

347
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:21,929
I have nothing to talk about with you.

348
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,249
- I said let's talk.
- I said, there's nothing to talk about, so stop it.

349
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,509
If you keep avoiding me,

350
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,287
I'll shout even louder here!

351
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,877
Let's go somewhere quiet.

352
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,619
I heard from Joon Pyo.

353
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:57,214
He told me you stayed next to me the whole time at the hospital.

354
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,767
Are you okay now?

355
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:02,603
Yes.

356
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:06,473
Physically, I'm better.

357
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,068
Good to hear that.

358
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:13,631
But emotionally, I'm not okay.

359
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,684
Hyung.

360
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:19,862
Hyung, what are we?

361
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:21,180
What do you mean?

362
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,890
You know what I'm asking.

363
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,179
Remember what happened during our trip?

364
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,639
What did it mean?

365
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,951
It was nothing.

366
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:37,187
Are you sure it was nothing?

367
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,284
All the things we said to each other,

368
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:46,113
what we did to each other,

369
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,283
and the emotion we felt.

370
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,452
Are you sure it was all nothing?

371
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:58,132
I think I was out of my mind.

372
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,928
Hyung, look at me.

373
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:04,356
Look straight into my face.

374
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:09,803
I feel like I'm going crazy when I look at your face.

375
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,233
Don't you feel the same?

376
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,104
I remember every moment we spent together.

377
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:24,125
And whenever I think about that time,

378
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,403
it makes me very happy.

379
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,567
You feel the same, right?

380
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,478
Ji Hyun, it really didn't mean anything.

381
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,067
I apologize for my misbehavior.

382
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,586
Let's just forget about it.

383
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,315
Also, now that the surfing club is over,

384
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:49,693
let's just ignore each other.
