1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:08,429
So the same trauma that's been suppressing you had happened again.

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,793
How could that happen?

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,900
That makes me think that life can be very horrible for some people.

4
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,746
Right?

5
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:34,658
So, in the end, it looks like you are torturing yourself out of guilt.

6
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,378
Do you still talk to that friend?

7
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:43,475
No. I'm avoiding him.

8
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,015
You're really selfish.

9
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,660
Sorry?

10
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:56,421
How am I being selfish?

11
00:00:56,421 --> 00:01:00,200
Don't you think about your friend who almost died in the ICU?

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,928
Because you are so focused on your trauma, you are ignoring others.

13
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,959
I think this is the way to protect my friend.

14
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,737
Fine.

15
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:15,723
Then slowly try to overcome your own trauma first.

16
00:01:15,723 --> 00:01:18,710
Your friend didn't die.

17
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,046
Don't beat yourself up.

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,189
I thought the opposite.

19
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:33,183
I really miss my friend.

20
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:38,704
But I thought seeing him again was selfish of me.

21
00:01:38,704 --> 00:01:40,474
Why?

22
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,628
He went through all that because of my selfishness.

23
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,897
So if he saw me again,

24
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:50,080
I thought it would be hard for him.

25
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,270
It might be the opposite.

26
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,866
I approached him first.

27
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,235
I asked him to stay by my side.

28
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:08,623
But if I do that again, I'm concerned I might hurt

29
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:10,776
and confuse him.

30
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:14,299
That is why I'm saying you are selfish.

31
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,202
You didn't even try to know how he actually thinks.

32
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,946
This decision was made only by yourself.

33
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:25,200
Okay. Take care of yourself first.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,079
And when you're ready, think about what to do next.

35
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,017
I want to protect him.

36
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,770
I really want to protect him.

37
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,899
But for now, I think this is for the best.

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,020
<i>[Ji Sub Lim]</i>

39
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,010

<i>[The Eighth Sense]</i>

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,292
Then what did he say?

47
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,572
He said he was out of his mind.

48
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,525
He wants to call it off.

49
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,302
Do you think he's being serious?

50
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,488
No.

51
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:56,733
I don't think he meant what he said.

52
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,528
How do you know that?

53
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,398
I can see it in his eyes.

54
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,827
He wants me to hold on to him.

55
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,604
Hey, do you know you are pretty narcissistic?

56
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:09,081
What does that mean?

57
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:13,791
Come on. It's a basic vocabulary.

58
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,297
Narcissism is a common-sense word.

59
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,568
Wait for me!

60
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,557
- Nice weather.
- Ae Ri is here.

61
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,726
Hi, Ae Ri.

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,330
I think I failed my major exam.

63
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,032
That's okay.

64
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:38,685
I heard that it's better for the grades to go up than go down

65
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,130
for applying for jobs later.

66
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,559
Isn't it different for art students?

67
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:46,519
Hey, that's a stereotype.

68
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,087
Who knows?

69
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,756
I might apply for an art museum of a conglomerate

70
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,608
and sort documents for a living.

71
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:57,046
I think you will do fine arts and live an artsy life.

72
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,299
Being a poor artist suits you better.

73
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,668
I have to make money to live.

74
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,737
Jae Won can make money for you.

75
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:14,078
Still not good with Jae Won?

76
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:15,656
It's the same.

77
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,125
Ji Hyun, have you ever given a deep thought about it?

78
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:24,174
The real reason why he's avoiding you.

79
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:28,043
No. I never thought deeply about it.

80
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:34,698
I don't think it's simply that he's regretting what he did with you and think it's a mistake,

81
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:41,053
or he's avoiding you for precaution because you got into an accident while you two were hanging out.

82
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,267
Because it seems abnormal.

83
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,878
Usually, when people experience something like that together,

84
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,933
don't they try to be next to each other more?

85
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:55,062
But Jae Won is acting weird.

86
00:05:55,062 --> 00:06:02,674
So I'm saying, did you take time to think about why he's acting this way?

87
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:06,813
I don't know. I never thought about it.

88
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,334
But I did try to confront him.

89
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,696
Then don't push him too hard.

90
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,191
Think about it in his shoes.

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,052
What do you think it is?

92
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,371
Why is he doing that?

93
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,177
He had a painful history.

94
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:32,614
He lost someone he really loved.

95
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,318
What happened?

96
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:39,230
I can't share the details since it's his story.

97
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,000
But now that I think about it, I think I can kind of get it.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,596
The reason why he's avoiding me so much

99
00:06:46,596 --> 00:06:49,349
and why it's so painful for him to see me.

100
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,988
I feel bad suddenly.

101
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,017
I feel like I've been selfish.

102
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,170
What's done is done.

103
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,398
I think there is a bigger and more fundamental problem.

104
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,984
Can I speak now?

105
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,136
What about this?

106
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:14,213
If I were Jae Won, I might avoid you to protect you.

107
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,761
So you don't get confused.

108
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,431
How does he feel about you?

109
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,233
Are you sure about that?

110
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,294
I was sure about it.

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,300
But I'm not sure now.

112
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,736
First of all, he is still not himself after the accident.

113
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:37,056
You need to help him to get himself back together.

114
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,708
Most importantly, do not rush and be careful.

115
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:51,953
Secondly, gently approach him so that he can feel the good memory and emotions he shared with you.

116
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,722
Okay.

117
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,192
I feel like I pushed someone who has trauma.

118
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:06,015
If so, you need to act more carefully on all these matters we talked about.

119
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:09,138
But the special situation is

120
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:13,650
that you have to do something about Eun Ji, who took advantage of this situation.

121
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,578
What makes me less confident is that Eun Ji told me

122
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,118
that Jae Won is not interested in me at all.

123
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,537
She said he doesn't even talk about me.

124
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:28,307
Are you seriously taken down by what she said?

125
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,126
What am I going to do with you?

126
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:35,096
Why would you be confused after what she said? Are you stupid?

127
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:38,291
I didn't take her seriously at first.

128
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,693
But she seems cooler than I thought.

129
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,397
I don't know anything right now.

130
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:48,059
Aren't they the hottest campus couple right now?

131
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,297
No.

132
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:57,416
She's not a good match for Jae Won.

133
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:01,030
Right now, he's just lost.

134
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,877
They posted a picture of them together on social media yesterday.

135
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,470
Let me see.

136
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,664
Hi, Mom.

137
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,695
I know. I'll apply somewhere else.

138
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,415
I can't believe the companies do not recognize my talent, Mom.

139
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,578
I have part-time work over the weekend, so I can't come.

140
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,929
I'll visit next time.

141
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,798
I have a class now. All right, bye.

142
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:52,966
Ji Hyun.

143
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,494
Hello.

144
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,634
Thank you for what you did for Jae Won.

145
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:03,819
No problem.

146
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,312
How are you feeling?

147
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:08,065
I'm sure you've heard this a million times. Sorry.

148
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,242
Maybe I should walk around with a note that says I'm okay.

149
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,157
- Ji Hyun.
- Yes?

150
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:21,669
I'm sorry to ask you a sensitive question,

151
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:24,540
but what are you going to do about the surf club?

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,767
I thought it was canceled.

153
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:30,519
I think we might get it approved again.

154
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,623
I have to talk to you about that.

155
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:36,409
Will you come to the club office by five?

156
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,162
Okay, I'll see you then.

157
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,621
Okay, see you later.

158
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:41,248
Okay.

159
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,211
Sorry, I'm late.

160
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:44,991
As I told you two before, I think our club can be approved again.

161
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:49,582
The trip you two went on together is considered part of the club activity,

162
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:52,027
so we have to write a report about it.

163
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:54,754
That's why I wanted to see you.

164
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,731
Let's begin.

165
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,044
Was it a day trip, or did you stay over there?

166
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,476
Why are you silent?

167
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,070
It was a day trip.

168
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,626
Ji Hyun is a beginner.

169
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:18,454
How could you bring him into the deep water on a wavy day right when you arrived at the beach?

170
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,947
That doesn't make any sense.

171
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:24,959
The school will point out that there wasn't enough training.

172
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,445
I'll just say you guys stayed over.

173
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,153
Not to harm the club, can we say that Jae Won Hyung...

174
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:36,112
I mean, can we write Jae Won Sunbae is not responsible for anything,

175
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:38,666
and the accident happened all by my mistake?

176
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:42,301
No, I can't do that.

177
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,907
We need to know what happened.

178
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:49,193
So if you honestly tell me everything about what happened and at what time,

179
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,478
it'll be easier for me to write.

180
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,775
Sunbaenim.

181
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,703
I need to get my physical therapy, so I can't go surfing for a while.

182
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:05,965
If I'm a member of the club, it'll be disadvantageous to get re-approval from the club.

183
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:12,105
So why don't I write the report that everything was my fault and bring it to you?

184
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,535
Is that okay?

185
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,969
- Ji Hyun.
- I need to go to work.

186
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:18,387
So excuse me first.

187
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,033
What's wrong with me?

188
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,654
Nothing's going right.

189
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:56,409
What's the point of working so hard to live?

190
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,830
I can't pay back my student loan with my part-time work.

191
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,835
All the companies rejected me.

192
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,658
I need to get myself together.

193
00:14:30,644 --> 00:14:32,929
Were you having such a hard time?

194
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,188
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

195
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:45,909
Okay?

196
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,212
So don't worry.

197
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:53,049
Everything will be okay.

198
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,290
Okay?

199
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,135
What should we eat?

200
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:13,629
Do you have anything in mind?

201
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,114
Nothing much.

202
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,893
I'm craving meat.
<i>[Sammi Restaurant]</i>

203
00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:22,895
How about there?

204
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,373
No, let's go somewhere else.

205
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:28,275
Why? That place is good.

206
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,971
Pork belly is the same anywhere.

207
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,965
Let's go here.

208
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:49,671
Oppa, should we go on a trip when we finish this assignment?

209
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,708
Let's go to Busan. We had so much fun in Busan.

210
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,872
That hotel by Haeundae was really nice.

211
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,644
You should eat more.

212
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,830
You need more energy.

213
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:22,544
Oppa, if you have no appetite, should we go out for some fresh air?

214
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:24,273
Okay.

215
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,538
Let's go back inside.

216
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:11,262
Nice weather today.

217
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:13,456
It's a nice day to walk.

218
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:14,866
You're right.

219
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,109
It's nice out tonight.

220
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:23,942
Oppa, do you want to stay together tonight?

221
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,936
No.

222
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,349
Now that you're back to your old self

223
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,968
and doing well on your assignment, I'll give you a prize.

224
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:37,329
A five-star hotel room is on me tonight.

225
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:40,915
I have to go back home. You should, too.

226
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:43,044
I'll call you a taxi.

227
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:46,038
Are you not going to walk me home?

228
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,409
Is it okay if I don't?

229
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,703
I'm not feeling that great right now. I'll grab you a taxi.

230
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,704
Oppa.

231
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:03,498
Get home safe.

232
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,657
Bye.

233
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:34,030
Hey, Ji Hyun.

234
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,506
Yes?

235
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,417
I found an account.

236
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:42,488
I think it's where Jae Won posts his photos.

237
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,798
What? Let me see.

238
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,159
How do you know it's Jae Won's account?

239
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,744
I'm so good at searching.

240
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:57,821
I went through all the accounts he made.

241
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,639
And I found his nickname.

242
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:03,759
I found a page where he posts his pictures anonymously.

243
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,786
Are you sure it's his?

244
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:10,216
Huh? Isn't this you from behind?

245
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,550
Right?

246
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,320
I think so.

247
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,431
- Hello.
- Hello.

248
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,709
Are you looking for something?

249
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,806
Let me look around first.

250
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,744
What is this one?

251
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,938
It's an instant film camera.

252
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,215
Oh, this is the instant camera.

253
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:18,277
Is this the new model?

254
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,752
You're right.

255
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,254
It's popular these days.

256
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,798
Can I have one of these, then?

257
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,410
Thank you.

258
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:38,671
Hyung.

259
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,189
Hi.

260
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,726
Hyung.

261
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,430
I won't pester you.

262
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,858
I won't say any other things, too.

263
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:21,948
Here.

264
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:27,935
It means nothing. I just wanted to give it to you.

265
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,475
The past is just past.

266
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:36,537
You can't erase or forget about the past.

267
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:41,681
But I thought starting with a new one

268
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:44,253
might not be a bad idea.

269
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:27,021
<i>[Hyung. I support your dream!]</i>

270
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,360
We can conclude like this, right?

271
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,188
Yes, I think we're done now.

272
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,808
Let's check for typos.

273
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,376
And send it to the professor.

274
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:03,713
Finally, it's done. You worked hard, Oppa.

275
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:07,934
Thank you for your work as well.

276
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,660
Now that the most important assignment is over,

277
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,346
should we eat at a hotel tonight?

278
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,297
Eun Ji.

279
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:28,741
Yes?

280
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,505
Let's end things here now.

281
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:40,684
The assignment? We finished it.

282
00:24:42,364 --> 00:24:45,474
No. I mean us.

283
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:54,617
What do you mean?

284
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,737
You always wanted to know, right?

285
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:02,491
The reason why I broke up with you back then.

286
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,279
The thing with Min Kyu Sunbae?

287
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,007
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

288
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:14,253
He was spreading rumors and stalking me.

289
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,598
When I was in the army, I wanted to surprise you.

290
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,633
So I took a day off without telling you.

291
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,769
And I saw you. You and Min Kyu Sunbae together.

292
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,942
What are you talking about?

293
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,845
See what?

294
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:33,513
I saw you two going into a motel.

295
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:36,153
I thought, maybe you felt lonely because I was away.

296
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:41,396
So just once, I tried to understand.

297
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,913
I hoped you'd be out soon.

298
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,818
So I waited for you all night in front of the motel.

299
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:57,980
But you didn't come out.

300
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,322
I even followed you in the morning.

301
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,019
I saw you guys on a date.

302
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:18,250
But when it happened, I felt guilty for being in the army,

303
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,661
so I couldn't break up with you for that reason.

304
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,407
Do you understand now?

305
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,779
Why I suddenly wanted to break up with you?

306
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,643
Oppa.

307
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,923
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,379
I'm not trying to justify what happened.

309
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:58,498
I was just so lonely.

310
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,843
So why did you...

311
00:27:00,843 --> 00:27:03,846
Why did you sign up for the Navy?

312
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:06,374
You were always on a ship,

313
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,134
never signed up for an on-the-land job,

314
00:27:08,134 --> 00:27:10,369
and were never on vacation.

315
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,404
I know, I understand.

316
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:14,973
So it's okay.

317
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,620
Oppa.

318
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,544
It won't happen again.

319
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,599
We were fine except for that time.

320
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,285
We can do it again. Please?

321
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,629
Eun Ji, I'll apologize to you.

322
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:40,548
I was out of my mind.

323
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm truly sorry.

324
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:47,882
Please don't do this to me.

325
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:51,443
We're finally back together.

326
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:54,713
I'm sorry.

327
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:59,017
Oppa.

328
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,617
We're closed.

329
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:08,071
Oh, okay.

330
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:12,140
Wow. You're a really handsome guy!

331
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,300
Are you hungry? Come, have a seat.

332
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,668
I thought you were closed.

333
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:19,279
Come on, have a seat.

334
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,523
Come on.

335
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:24,826
Look how handsome you are.

336
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,666
You will not do something inappropriate, right?

337
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,500
Don't be so scared.

338
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,528
Do you think I'll do something to you?

339
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:37,272
Come sit here, quickly.

340
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:49,516
So, what brings you here alone at this hour?

341
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:53,205
I'm here to eat, not to talk to a fortune teller.

342
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:59,293
I opened a restaurant here to listen to students' stories.

343
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:03,332
Otherwise, with my beauty, I would have opened it somewhere else.

344
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:06,777
Somewhere with rich men, you know?

345
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:08,888
Wait here. I'll bring you food.

346
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:12,441
Wait here, handsome Oppa.

347
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,697
Dig in.

348
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,842
Thank you for the food.

349
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:35,948
That was delicious.

350
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,263
Okay.

351
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,309
Do you have a concern?

352
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,782
I can't seem to organize my life.

353
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,727
Then organize it.

354
00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:03,466
I feel like something got screwed up big time.

355
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,303
I don't know where to start to fix it.

356
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,138
Oh, seriously.

357
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,256
Just spill the tea. You're frustrating me.

358
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:14,585
If it's that easy to organize, I wouldn't be worrying.

359
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,413
Is it a money problem?

360
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,006
No.

361
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,742
Health problem?

362
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:23,262
No, health is fine.

363
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,014
Look how lucky you are.

364
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:27,791
If those two are okay, you're good.

365
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,027
If it were money or a health problem, I wouldn't be worrying this much.

366
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:39,033
Hey, money and health issues cannot be solved no matter how hard you try.

367
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,629
Oh, seriously.

368
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:45,229
Sorry, I'm so messed up like this.

369
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:51,540
You see, students still come here after they graduate and have work.

370
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,870
Your problem in your teenage seems to be the biggest problem at that time.

371
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:01,439
And when you're in your 20s, your issues at that time seem to be the biggest.

372
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:08,504
But even in your 30s and 40s, you'll still be stressed and worried.

373
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:12,360
If I'm still like this in my 30s, I'm in trouble.

374
00:31:14,555 --> 00:31:16,023
Why are you hitting me?

375
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:18,569
Why are you so discouraged?

376
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:22,947
Get yourself together. You'll get sick if you worry so much.

377
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,857
I'm already suffering from depression.

378
00:31:29,145 --> 00:31:31,672
Just live however you want.

379
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,357
You only live once.

380
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:36,226
Let's just live however we want.

381
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:41,556
He really did have a good friend.

382
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,400
What did you say?

383
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,177
Nothing. Cheers!

384
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:49,331
Okay, cheers!

385
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:54,599
<i>All the people, all the lovers, and all my friends.</i>

386
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,477
<i>I hope that they'll all get their happy end.</i>

387
00:33:57,477 --> 00:34:00,512
<i>On that note, let's hear the next song request.</i>

388
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:08,177
What's this song?

389
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:10,221
I don't know.

390
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,430
Let me look it up.

391
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,820
♫ <i>It's kinda short, kinda boring</i> ♫

392
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,150
♫ <i>But the end is a whirl</i> ♫

393
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,534
♫ <i>They were just sixteen</i> ♫

394
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:23,277
It's good.

395
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:29,438

00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:03,880
♫ <i>If we worked and we saved we could both run away
