00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,690
Hey, what are you doing?

22
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:12,423
Hey, get yourself together! Don't do that.

23
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm making the penalty drink!

24
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,130
What on earth is he doing?

25
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:20,481
Listen. Here's a welcome drink for the freshmen.

26
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,219
You guys are three, so you decide how much each of you will drink.

27
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,922
I can't drink.

28
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:31,101
Tae Hyung, stop it. It's such an outdated thing to do!

29
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,762
What? Outdated?

30
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:38,958
Are you disregarding me because you are in charge?

31
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,427
You keep the shitty tradition to yourself.

32
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,323
Tradition is tradition. You can do it.

33
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:48,350
You don't have to drink it.

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,930
Once you get going, you can do it!

35
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:54,799
- What's going on?
- Stop drinking it!

36
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,176
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

37
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,890
You were quiet the whole time! What's going on?

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,030
- Can you drink all that?
- No!

39
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,528
It tasted good, didn't it?

40
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,160
Ji Hyun.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,510
Yes?

42
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,680
Thanks for earlier.

43
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,120
No worries.

44
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:33,471
We're in the same art college, so we'll run into each other often on campus.

45
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,120
Let's say hi to each other then.

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,690
Yes.

47
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:41,137
Cheers.

48
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,680
It's very good to see you guys getting closer. Let me join you guys.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,970
Is there any more beer? Oh, I got one. Cheers!

50
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,670
Cheers!

51
00:03:53,066 --> 00:04:02,299
Do you remember we drank the bucket of alcohol together when we first met at the first-year orientation?

52
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:10,466
We tried to exempt Yoon Won from it and drank it all!

53
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,903
Stop it, I said.

54
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:15,730
We're bound together forever, okay?

55
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,610
- Yes, forever.
- We are friends forever!

56
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,900
We are together forever.

57
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,700
Yoon Won Sunbae.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,562
Yes?

59
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,106
Does Jae Won always like that?

60
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:38,602
It's his drunk habit to kiss random people.

61
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:41,372
And he's super drunk tonight.

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,300
Hey, stop it.

63
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,293
The surfing session is canceled for today.

64
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,163
Seo Jae Won!

65
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,500
Hey.

66
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,510
Are you all right?

67
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,590
Yes, I'm fine.

68
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,330
You drank a lot last night.

69
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,440
Yes, I did.

70
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:19,798
Do you remember that you kissed?

71
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,328
With whom?

72
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,564
With Tae Hyung.

73
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,003
I don't want to go back.

74
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,266
I don't know if we came here to surf or to drink.

75
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,496
I checked, everyone got on the bus.

76
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,691
Hurry up. I'm so hungover.

77
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:02,685
Okay. We're leaving now.

78
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,710
We're going to stop at Hongcheon rest stop. But let me know if you really need to go to the restroom before we get there.

79
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,430
<i>Okay!</i>

80
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:21,061
Let's go.

81
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,189
The first Free Bird surfing trip of this semester is now over. I'm glad nobody got injured.

82
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,670
I'll let you all know when the next schedule comes out. Thank you for participating.

83
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,070
<i>Thank you!</i>

84
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,915
Thank you.

85
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,710
- Thank you.
- See you.

86
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,970
Bye, see you.

87
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,270
- Thank you.
- See you.

88
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,724
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

89
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:08,940
- Ji Hyun.
- Yes?

90
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,190
Bit Na and I are going to eat something. Do you want to join us?

91
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,360
What? Do you have plans for later?

92
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,510
It's not like that.

93
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,947
Let's go have a drink together as fellow freshmen.

94
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:24,970
All right.

95
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,780
Let's go.

96
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,278
Jae Won, let's go for another drink.

97
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,557
We never hung out since you came back from the military. Let's go for a drink.

98
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:45,404
Well, I need to organize things with Yoon Won. I'll give you a call if I can come.

99
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:50,467
If you don't come, it'll be a complete betrayal. Yoon Won, come together.

100
00:11:53,604 --> 00:11:55,189
What are you going to do now?

101
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:58,934
I'm going home. This hangover is killing me.

102
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,847
I don't want to drink with those guys.

103
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,451
- Okay, I'm going.
- Okay.

104
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:13,807
Sir, please don't forget to issue the tax invoice, this way we get some support funds from the university.

105
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,534
- Okay.
- Please don't forget.

106
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,995
- Thank you for your work. Have a great day.
- You, too.

107
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,690
Finally, it's all over.

108
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,800
You've done a good job.

109
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,420
Are you going to drink with them?

110
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,370
We need to take a break as well.

111
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,808
And by that, you mean just the two of us to go for a drink, right?

112
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:33,160
- Let's go.
- Go!

113
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,888
Oh my, do you want to live like this?

114
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,781
Ji Hyun, is there anything you want to eat?

115
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,442
Nothing in particular. Let's go where you guys want to go.

116
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:53,590
Come to think of it, we went to the beach but didn't even eat seafood.

117
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,620
- You're right.
- Shall we go for seafood, then?

118
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes. Seafood with day drinking sounds great!

119
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,690
Are you okay with it, Ji Hyun?

120
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,760
Yes. Let's go.

121
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,782
What do you want to have? I'm starving.

122
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,269
What do you want?

123
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,514
<i>Hi, guys. What can I get you?</i>

124
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:27,079
We would like pepperoni pizza and draft beers. Draft beers!

125
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,891
<i>Sorry?</i>

126
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>Hi, how are you?</i>

127
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,890
<i>Could we get pepperoni pizza, two pints of Guinness,</i>

128
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,050
<i>and two shots of tequila, please?</i>

129
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,493
<i>Sure. Coming right up.</i>

130
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:42,610
Your English is pretty good.

131
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,410
I was a bit nervous.

132
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,410
<i>Two Guinness.</i>

133
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,480
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

134
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:53,950
<i>Two tequila.</i>

135
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,820
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

136
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,890
Cheers.

137
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,724
That's the taste.

138
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:16,554
How long has it been since the last time it was just the two of us drinking?

139
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:20,726
I'm glad that you are still here.

140
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:28,099
It's not like I had much of a choice. I'm just staying in school until I get a job.

141
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,859
Sorry.

142
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,120
I should be the one to be thankful.

143
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,367
I thought you wouldn't come back to the surf club.

144
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:39,920
Why? Because of Eun Ji?

145
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,401
No. Usually, club activities fall by the wayside during graduation year.

146
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,537
I thought you would do the same.

147
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:54,551
I really don't care about you and Eun Ji's issue.

148
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,956
Stories between men and women, it's their own business.

149
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:02,942
As a person from outside, it's not my place to worry and care.

150
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,088
It's funny.

151
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,734
What is?

152
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,688
Honestly, I didn't like you when I was a freshman.

153
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:18,744
Really? I thought you had feelings for me because you were so nice to me.

154
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:22,290
Hey, I'm nice to everyone when it's face-to-face.

155
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,690
That's your problem!

156
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,100
<i>Pepperoni pizza.</i>

157
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,160
<i>Thank you!</i>

158
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,830
<i>- You're welcome.
- Okay.</i>

159
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,783
Again, that's your problem. Pretending to be a nice person.

160
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,610
Doesn't it exhaust you?

161
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
It is exhausting.

162
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,883
I need to fix that in me and stop pretending to be a nice person.

163
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,527
Express what you don't like, as I do.

164
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,938
That's the reason I didn't like you.

165
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:51,860
Why do you keep talking about the past? Are you getting old?

166
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:57,706
We met as freshmen, but we are already in our mid-twenties.

167
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,320
I didn't like you when we were freshmen.

168
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,963
But it's funny that I feel most comfortable around you now.

169
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,024
That's how friendship works.

170
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,552
No matter how close I was with my friends from my year,

171
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,013
it's strangely uncomfortable to see them now, after they got employed.

172
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,923
I don't see them often anymore.

173
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,001
Isn't that because you feel insecure?

174
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:22,898
No, I mean, friendship is similar to love.

175
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:29,145
Sometimes, it naturally falls apart, and a new friendship can be ignited.

176
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,792
Are we on fire now?

177
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,453
Since it's on fire, order me another tequila.

178
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:41,374
I'm thirsty for tequila, Oppa. Buy me a tequila shot.

179
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:42,840
You order this time.

180
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,220
No, I can't!

181
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,081
Try it. It gets better with each try.

182
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:55,680
<i>Tequila, two! Tequila, two.</i>

183
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,500
<i>All right.</i>

184
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:01,687
- You did a good job.
- He understood, right?

185
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,422
- Yes, he got it.
- Right?

186
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,210
Let's do cheers, just us freshmen!

187
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,600
<i>Cheers!</i>

188
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:21,715
Ji Hyun, where are you from?

189
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,430
I don't think you'll know even if I tell you.

190
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,802
Tell me! Where is it?

191
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:28,255
You really won't know even if I tell you.

192
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,967
It's near Daegu.

193
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,271
Why don't you have an accent?

194
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,392
I just never had one.

195
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:45,005
I know you can speak the dialect. Show us.

196
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,431
I really don't have one.

197
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:52,079
Speaking in dialect is popular with Seoul kids. Just show us once, please.

198
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,482
It's enough. Just drink up. <i>(in dialect accent)</i>

199
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,396
It's so cute!

200
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:04,407
One more time.

201
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:07,095
It's enough. Stop it. <i>(in dialect accent)</i>

202
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:10,263
- "Stop it."
- "Stop it!"

203
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,925
- Did I do it right?
- Seriously, stop it. Let's eat.

204
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,110
<i>There you are.</i>

205
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,678
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

206
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:20,865
Since it's here, we should drink it right away.

207
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:23,410
One, two, three.

208
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,450
This is the real deal!

209
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,162
It's burning my throat.

210
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:44,388
By the way, Yoon Won. It felt good to surf in a while.

211
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,683
Of course, it feels good.

212
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:48,440
Hey.

213
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:51,970
I forgot about this.

214
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,180
What is this?

215
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,553
The freshman boy gave it to us as a thank you.

216
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,773
He's a really good kid. Look here.

217
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:16,496
Look, he made my body look great. He has good senses.

218
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,441
What are you doing?

219
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,464
Seriously! You're crazy!

220
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,025
It's gross!

221
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,920
Shall we have another drink?

222
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,430
No.

223
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,557
Let's have one more drink.

224
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:13,461
Are you crazy? I drank too much last night as well. I'm out.

225
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,000
Go with Ji Hyun.

226
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,176
Ji Hyun, do you want to go for another drink?

227
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,688
I'm tired too. I think I should get going.

228
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:30,228
Oh, they are our seniors. Hello, Sunbaenim!

229
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,130
Hi, guys. Did you guys have drinks?

230
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,967
Yes. Did you have some drinks, too?

231
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:35,984
Yes.

232
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,220
Aren't you going home too early?

233
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,520
When we were freshmen, we drank until morning.

234
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:46,318
I would like to do that, but these two refuse.

235
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:49,590
- Get home safely.
- Goodbye.

236
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,670
Bye!

237
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,040
What's going on between those two?

238
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,510
I thought she was a lesbian. I wonder what's going on.

239
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,620
It's only the start for them.

240
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,350
I wonder who will become a couple.

241
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,776
Do you call that playing a game?

242
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,120
What? The way I talk?

243
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,368
Don't you like the way I talk? Then play the game properly!

244
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,232
He's so bad at it!

245
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,665
Do you want some beer?

246
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,590
What are you doing?

247
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,430
Get away from me.

248
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:57,115
You became such a popular kid!

249
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,045
Who's this guy?

250
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,000
A senior in the surf club.

251
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:08,677
What is it? Did you make a new best friend?

252
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,090
Is that what it is?

253
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,970
No, so leave me alone.

254
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,787
But why are there so many photos of yours?

255
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:19,963
Are there any photos of the girls?

256
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,200
<i>[Ae Ri(Free Bird): I posted photos on the group page. Check it out.]</i>

257
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
Oh? She's the one from the poster.
<i>[Ae Ri(Free Bird): I posted photos on the group page. Check it out.]</i>

258
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Wow, she's freaking gorgeous.

259
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,830
<i>[Ji Hyun: Yes, I saw it. Thank you.]</i>

260
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,767
How is she? Did you get close to her?

261
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:40,543
<i>[Ae Ri(Free Bird): Why are you up so late?^.^]</i>

262
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:42,500
<i>[Ji Hyun: I was about to go to bed. Good night.]</i>

263
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,420
<i>[Ae Ri(Free Bird): You, too.]</i>

264
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,170
Hey.

265
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,830
Yes?

266
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:10,454
About kissing... When exactly does it happen?

267
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,341
What do you mean?

268
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:18,729
You don't ask for permission before doing it.

269
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,410
You won't announce that you'll kiss before doing so.

270
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,571
So how do you decide the timing?

271
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:32,852
Humans are animals. You do it when it feels right.

272
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:36,364
If the other person doesn't like you, they'll step away.

273
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,210
What?

274
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,990
What's going on?

275
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,220
What happened?

276
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,428
You don't tell me anything.

277
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,840
The weather is really nice, right?

278
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,720
It is.

279
00:24:18,348 --> 00:24:22,869
Let's each grab an iced Americano to look cool.

280
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,350
Sure.

281
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,190
But you don't even drink coffee.

282
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,610
Do you know the taste of coffee?

283
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,250
I don't know it either.

284
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,814
<i>[Mom, I had a great time on the club trip.]</i>

285
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,280
What kind of taste is this?

286
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,990
Hi.

287
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,740
Oh, hi.

288
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:39,590
Are you taking this class?

289
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,540
Yes, this is a mandatory class.

290
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,260
Why? You don't want to sit together?

291
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,010
No, no. It's fine.

292
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:57,956
Apparently, this professor is famous for giving low grades when it's only liberal arts!

293
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,901
Ji Hyun, do you want to eat lunch in the cafeteria or off campus?

294
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,450
What?

295
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:15,823
You have a class later. You need to eat lunch.

296
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,590
I was going to eat with my friend.

297
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,660
Really? Let's all eat together.

298
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,090
Oh, that's... He's a little shy.

299
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,060
Maybe next time?

300
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:31,450
All right.

301
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,290
See you.

302
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:40,349
Move fast!

303
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,230
What are you doing?

304
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,080
Just hurry up.

305
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,271
- Don't say anything. If you do, you're dead to me.
- Kim Ji Hyun!

306
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,832
- You walk so fast.
- Ae Ri...

307
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:52,593
Hi, I'm Koh Ae Ri. Who are you?

308
00:26:52,593 --> 00:26:54,838
This is Joon Pyo.

309
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:58,099
- Ji Hyun, do you want to eat dinner with me?
- What?

310
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,412
Even though we're freshmen, things around the campus are a bit boring, right?

311
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:05,573
I'll take you to a famous restaurant in Gangnam.

312
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,835
Oh, I actually have plans with Joon Pyo…

313
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,696
My class ends first in the early afternoon.

314
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,957
Call me when your class ends.

315
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,602
I… Joon Pyo…

316
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:22,090
Who was she?

317
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,700
She's a girl from the surf club.

318
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,779
Then why were you acting so rude to her? She looks like a nice girl.

319
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,200
Is she from Seoul?

320
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,740
Yes.

321
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:34,085
What is it? Is she the one you kissed?

322
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,354
No.

323
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:41,826
I can't believe you met a girl from Seoul within a month of moving here. You grew up so fast!

324
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,510
Do you want to die?

325
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,080
What's wrong?

326
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,890
Why are you always eating that?

327
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,680
Hey, set me up with a girl from Seoul, too.

328
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:57,480
She's a fellow freshman in the surf club, and I think she's the same age as me.

329
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,319
But she makes me feel uncomfortable.

330
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,480
You still have the habits from high school time.

331
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,809
We're adults now. We must live a life filled with romance.

332
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,971
If you bring a girl back to the room again, I'll report it to the dorm supervisor.

333
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:14,042
All right. I was trying to save some money by not spending it on a motel while you were away.

334
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:15,130
Why would you--!

335
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,754
I told her not to touch anything of yours.

336
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:21,010
Oh, Hello!

337
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,670
Hello.

338
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,670
You're Ji Hyun's new best friend, right?

339
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,770
Yes.

340
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,498
I saw you in the surf club trip photos.

341
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:34,610
I'm Ji Hyun's childhood friend, Joon Pyo.

342
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,570
You are more handsome in person.

343
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,583
Thank you.

344
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:42,570
If you're Ji Hyun's new best friend, we're all best friends now. So please talk comfortably to me.

345
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,883
How can I do that when we just met? I'll be more chill next time we meet and have a meal together.

346
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:50,879
Then will you buy us a meal next time when you be more chill around us?

347
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,950
That sounds great. Let's go for a meal with Ji Hyun together.

348
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,200
Sounds great.

349
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,470
- Enjoy your meal.
- You guys, too.

350
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,890
Yes.

351
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:10,731
He's so handsome.

352
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,604
What are you doing? Are you not going to eat?

353
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:21,417
I'm eating. You need to stay quieter.

354
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,410
Why?

355
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,429
It's embarrassing.

356
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,890
What are you embarrassed about? All I did was ask him to have a meal together next time.

357
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,370
How have you been?

358
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,330
The same as usual. I'm doing fine.

359
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,310
You've been coming here since high school.

360
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,080
So we've known each other for nearly ten years, right?

361
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:52,780
Right. I was stressed about the college entrance exam, and my parents forced me to come here.

362
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,630
But now you are here with your own will.

363
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,650
Or are you just coming for the drugs?

364
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:14,086
Why did you come here again on your day off?

365
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,350
Did you make some friends during the trip?

366
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,900
Friends? I'm not sure.

367
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,292
Stop working and go over there and rest.

368
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm sick of it.

369
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,650
Do you want to take over this store after you graduate?

370
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,149
Then I'm going to change the entire interior design.

371
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:56,203
Why? It's not too bad for a university-area drinking hole.

372
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:58,281
I'm kidding.

373
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:02,110
By the way, where are you going?

374
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm going to see someone.

375
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,373
What do you mean, someone? Are you going to see a friend?

376
00:31:07,373 --> 00:31:12,294
A friend? I'm just going out to see a new acquaintance.

377
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:16,849
At your age, you shouldn't be picky about people. That's what you do at my age.

378
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:21,930
I think it's still awkward for me when someone approaches me.

379
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,800
There must be a reason.

380
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:29,035
Do you have a reason or a purpose for being here with me right now?

381
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:31,239
It's because I like you.

382
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:37,812
Whether it's a friendship or love, wouldn't someone approach you because they like you?

383
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,773
Why? Did someone approach you?

384
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,109
Yes.

385
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,570
Then they must like you! That's why.

386
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,131
What are you waiting for? Go see that person.

387
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,410
Hurry up and go.

388
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,270
- I'll get going.
- There you go.

389
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,260
Call me if you need help.

390
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,910
I'm good. Everything runs just fine without you.
