00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,491
Hyung! Seriously...

37
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:26,466
What?

38
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:28,441
I thought you were gone.

39
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,783
I was having coffee because Joon Pyo bought it for us.

40
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:34,158
Seriously, you...

41
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:36,041
Were you scared?

42
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:40,225
Sorry, I won't make you scared again.

43
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:42,758
I can leave if you guys want.

44
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,308
I'll let you kiss.

45
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,066
You're crazy.

46
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,225
I'll never do it in front of you.

47
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,058
Watch your language, Ji Hyun.

48
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,225
Never leave me alone again.

49
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,716
I will never leave you alone again.

50
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:04,016
Hyung, what should I wear to a club?

51
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:06,683
What? Just dress the way you want.

52
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:11,058
But shorts and slippers are not allowed.

53
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,691
- These?
- Those are not allowed.

54
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,758
Can I pick up girls if I go?

55
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,650
It shows obvious if you go clubbing just to pick up girls.

56
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,666
Just enjoy the vibe and the music.

57
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:30,283
As you naturally enjoy clubbing, you will naturally meet someone.

58
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:31,375
- Hyung.
- Yes?

59
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,875
Will you go with me?

60
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,658
Sure. Let's go clubbing together.

61
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,775
Joon Pyo stayed up all night for us.

62
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,933
Should we go out somewhere so he can sleep?

63
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,458
Sure.

64
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,966
Did you just say, "Sure?"

65
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:51,283
I'm still older than you, you know.

66
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:52,591
Yes, Sir.

67
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,933
Sunbaenim, are you satisfied now?

68
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:58,283
No, before was cuter.

69
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,460
Aren't you cold in the mornings?

70
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,975
I'm fine.

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,725
You're cold, right?

72
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,166
Hold on.

73
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,716
Let's go.

74
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,108
Are you hungry, Ji Hyun?

75
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,575
I am.

76
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,600
Do you want to go to the dorm cafeteria?

77
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,541
Well, now that we are dating...

78
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:51,408
I mean, how should I put this?

79
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,366
Now that we are like now, and it's our first meal together.

80
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,916
Let's go somewhere nice.

81
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,783
Okay. Sounds good.

82
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:02,858
Good? Let's go.

83
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,560
What do you want to eat?

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,490
<i>[Menu]</i>

85
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,700
The menu is so hard to read.

86
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,366
Should I just order?

87
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,350
Sure.

88
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,841
Again?

89
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:42,983
I just felt comfortable. I'm sorry.

90
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:47,291
No, I like it better. Keep it that way.

91
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,475
I will do so once it feels more natural.

92
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,875
I'll go order then.

93
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,425
Hyung.

94
00:07:20,616 --> 00:07:23,108
Then are we...

95
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,766
Yes, we're dating.

96
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:27,558
I've never felt like this before as well,

97
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:30,766
so it might take some time to sink in.

98
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,950
But, yes, we're dating.

99
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:36,550
Happy?

100
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes. I'm happy.

101
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,016
What are you so happy about?

102
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,525
It's because you made it clear for me.

103
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,500
If you hadn't said it out clearly,

104
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,083
I know I'd have a difficult time again.

105
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,708
Anything else?

106
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,991
And I'm happy because I now have someone to go to Namsan Tower with.

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,375
Anything else?

108
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,025
And...

109
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:14,058
I'm happy because I now have someone to put a heart next to the name on my phone.

110
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,425
And?

111
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,140
And...

112
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:24,225
We are dating.

113
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:31,558
And as for me... I'm happy to have someone I can call my boyfriend.

114
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,450
And I'm happier because it's you.

115
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,816
You're cheesy.

116
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,966
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,591
I won't make you sad again.

118
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,333
It's Yoon Won.

119
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,241
Hello?

120
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,516
Yes, Yoon Won.

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,091
Yes.

122
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,733
Wow, really?

123
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:26,900
That's great news. Congratulations!

124
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,891
Yes, yes.

125
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,400
One second.

126
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,066
Are you working tonight?

127
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,000
I think it should be fine.

128
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,308
Okay. All right.

129
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,016
What's going on?

130
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,266
Yoon Won passed the open recruitment.

131
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:58,175
Really? That's great!

132
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:02,316
Also, the surf club got approved again.

133
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:04,708
So she wants to throw a party.

134
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,433
Is that okay?

135
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,150
I see.

136
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:13,850
Are you still going to be part of the club?

137
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:17,350
If you graduate and leave the surf club,

138
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,808
there's no reason for me to be there.

139
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,375
You just admitted it.

140
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,766
You joined the surf club to see me.

141
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:28,100
No, I didn't.

142
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,183
When are you going to admit it?

143
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:31,816
How about you?

144
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:35,375
When we first met, you had your lighter, right?

145
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,458
You just pretended not to have one, only to talk to me, right?

146
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,058
I really didn't have one with me.

147
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:43,225
Don't lie to me.

148
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,616
Just eat.

149
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:55,816
Don't you think the weather is amazing, Ji Hyun?

150
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,366
What's that over there?

151
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,116
Just look at that cherry blossom tree.

152
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:02,508
Yes, it's beautiful.

153
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:06,225
- You don't have class today, right?
- Right.

154
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,125
Should I skip class and go out on a date?

155
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,666
No, you can't.

156
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,166
Think about how hard your parents work for your tuition.

157
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,366
I was at the top of my class when I got in. So I have a full scholarship.

158
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,633
You know what I mean.

159
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:23,016
I have to go home, shower, and get changed.

160
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,233
And sleep where?

161
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,500
What do you mean where? I sleep at my home.

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,050
Joon Pyo is going out to meet people from his online gaming.

163
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,500
So he's not coming home tonight.

164
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,130
You'll come home with me, right?

165
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,850
Is that what it is?

166
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:43,840
But I still sleep at my home.

167
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,100
Really?

168
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,625
You'll be late for class. Hurry up and go.

169
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,433
Call me.

170
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,983
Walk me to the bottom of the stairs.

171
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,541
You'll be late. Hurry up and go.

172
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:00,466
I'm really going.

173
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,150
Yes, go ahead. Watch your steps.

174
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,208
Look ahead. You'll get hurt.

175
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,800
Really?

176
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:24,258
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:26,600
Oh, that's right. Are you working tonight?

178
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,808
There's a party for Yoon Won tonight.

179
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,550
How did you know about that?

180
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,791
Yoon Won told me to tell you and Bit Na.

181
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,658
What? I just heard about it.

182
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:40,350
From whom?

183
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,791
From Yoon Won.

184
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:50,341
She just called me to tell you about it.

185
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:57,950
What is it? What happened?

186
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:06,616
Okay. I got it.

187
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,808
Wait.

188
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,850
Is this what's happening?

189
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,541
Why are you making a fuss about it?

190
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,666
I'm just happy for you.

191
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,941
I can't believe it.

192
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,633
Wait a second.

193
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,575
You look good in this leather jacket.

194
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,533
I guess it's a good one, right?

195
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,233
Doesn't Tae Hyung look like the yellow dog character?

196
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,808
You know, the dog eating pollack soup.

197
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:34,616
Hey, Seo Jae Won!

198
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:36,258
You're here!

199
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:38,058
How have you been?

200
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,316
Hey, I'm here too.

201
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:42,341
You know this is my party, right?

202
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:43,933
Congratulations, you deserve it.

203
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,866
You're right. I worked so hard!

204
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,675
You know how I feel, right?

205
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:48,400
Of course, I know.

206
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,866
I don't think you do.

207
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,591
I'll know if you give me some pocket money.

208
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:53,016
Don't be silly.

209
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,866
Have a seat. I'll be right back.

210
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,900
Is it my turn?

211
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:50,241
You're lucky that I didn't ask you for a hospital bill.

212
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,675
Go ahead and charge me.

213
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,475
You're sorry, right?

214
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,600
Of course, I'm sorry.

215
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:19,083
I'm also sorry that I brought you to the Disciplinary Committee,

216
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:24,033
saying I'll make you suspended from school.

217
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:34,975
Do you think I don't know your personality?

218
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,775
Will you understand me?

219
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,041
I told you, I understand.

220
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,391
Jae Won.

221
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,258
Why do you stay friends with someone like me?

222
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:07,366
Honestly, when we were in the first year when I first saw you,

223
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,700
I thought, "What the heck is wrong with him?"

224
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,158
Was I weird?

225
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,875
No, you weren't weird.

226
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,600
You just don't wear a mask in front of other people.

227
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:25,175
Whoever it is, no matter how they judge you,

228
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:29,000
you treat everyone the same way.

229
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,066
I liked that about you.

230
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,225
Seo Jae Won! Seriously...

231
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:39,650
I was just under a lot of pressure about graduating.

232
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,050
So I was out of my sane mind.

233
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,316
I get it, Tae Hyung.

234
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:47,150
I understand.

235
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,308
Hello.

236
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,308
You're here, cutie.

237
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,300
Congratulations.

238
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Thank you.

239
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,550
Who is this?

240
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,308
I'm sorry, he's my friend. He was begging to follow me here.

241
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:05,200
Hello. I'm Joon Pyo, Ji Hyun's best friend since childhood.

242
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,108
I wanted to be here for the good news.

243
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm sorry if I'm being rude. Congratulations.

244
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,966
Thank you. Have a seat!

245
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:14,991
Keep yourself to yourself.

246
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,708
I really want to put that in.

247
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,133
It's driving me crazy.

248
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:27,750
Attention, please!

249
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:34,916
Today, Yoon Won, the queen of busybodies,

250
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,408
became the first person to escape from the hell of job searching.

251
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:40,408
Give her a round of applause!

252
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:49,275
Some of you may feel jealous, envious, and also deprived.

253
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:52,100
But I will not allow that today.

254
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,275
Today is about celebration, harmony, forgiveness, and reconciliation.

255
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,625
For everything!

256
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,075
For everything!

257
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:10,341
Hey, you dressed up so much today.

258
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:14,291
Who did you dress up for?

259
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,483
I don't have to dress up anymore.

260
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,150
Why?

261
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:24,225
I thought it was going well.

262
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:26,108
Is it over already?

263
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,425
No.

264
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,475
It's because he likes me for who I am.

265
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,275
Seriously?

266
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:45,275
I want my old Ji Hyun back. It was fun teasing you back then.

267
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:49,358
So how did it go?

268
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,833
I'm officially dating Seo Jae Won now.

269
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:05,183
But you know, your anniversary with him

270
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:07,391
is really unclear, right?

271
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,958
Is it the first day you met?

272
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,533
Is it the first kiss?

273
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,575
Or the first trip together? Or yesterday?

274
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:17,291
You're right.

275
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:20,558
When is the first day to commemorate our relationship?

276
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,433
Hey, Kim Ji Hyun.

277
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,791
How can you get swayed by my words?

278
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,358
Just decide on a date with him.

279
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:34,140
But I'm really curious now.

280
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,970
Just eat this.

281
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:42,733
So, is he treating you well?

282
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,760
Why would you ask me that?

283
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,440
Is it like butterflies in your stomach?

284
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,110
What?
Is it like you can't live without each other or something?

285
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,625
Love each other so much or something?

286
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,950
Stop it.

287
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:01,133
Hey, Bit Na.

288
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,841
- Can we talk?
- Let go of me.

289
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,133
What are you doing right now?

290
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,030
I mean...

291
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,825
I have nothing to talk about with you.

292
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:14,083
And please don't touch me like that.

293
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:19,000
Sunbae, I know you are spreading false rumors behind my back.

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,983
I'm being patient right now.

295
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:23,600
So don't make me angry.

296
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,750
Bit Na. Bit Na, wait--

297
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,516
I'm really fond of you.

298
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,458
This is also part of growing up, right?

299
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,383
Yes, I think you are all grown up from now on.

300
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:51,083
Right?

301
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:58,366
Wait, what is this dart for?

302
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:02,175
Bit Na already pierced a dart in my heart!

303
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,916
So what's the point of this dart?

304
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,191
You look good. Seo Jae Won is finally back.

305
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,425
You really worked hard.

306
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:21,058
You took care of the club, freshmen, and friends.

307
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm sincerely happy that you are the first to get a job.

308
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,358
Thank you.

309
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:36,458
By the way, did you ever think of me as a woman?

310
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,833
Unfortunately, never.

311
00:21:40,683 --> 00:21:43,833
That's because we are so similar.

312
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:49,266
You were also busy taking care of people around you.

313
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:52,883
But I won't do that anymore.

314
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:57,216
I'll only focus on important people in my life.

315
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,450
Treat him well.

316
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,183
Don't let people say you messed with a young kid.

317
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,791
What are you talking about?

318
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:28,866
Jae Won. We've been friends for six years.

319
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:30,916
Don't you think I know?

320
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:45,666
Fine, then give me some advice as the master of dating younger ones.

321
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:49,950
You see, it's a double-edged sword.

322
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,416
The younger one might worry the older partner might not take things seriously.

323
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,200
And the older one might worry

324
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,725
that this young kid likes me with no other experience to measure,

325
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:05,600
and they might leave when I got really old.

326
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,533
So how do you overcome that?

327
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:10,541
What do you mean by how to?

328
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,666
You just give it a try.

329
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,491
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

330
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,941
Best friend Hyung!

331
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,633
Oh, hello.

332
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,833
Hello. Did you say you are Ji Hyun's friend?

333
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,408
- Yes.
- Then are you a freshman?

334
00:23:35,408 --> 00:23:37,066
Yes, I am.

335
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,050
- You two talk.
- Okay.

336
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,966
Nice vest.

337
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,333
Right?

338
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,575
Where did you buy it?

339
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:51,216
My mom bought it for me.

340
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,550
You still wear clothes that your mom buys.

341
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,090
Yes.

342
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,416
Did you drink a lot?

343
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,650
No.

344
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,566
Eun Ji.

345
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:24,633
Let's not make it awkward.

346
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,583
I think it's always like this when you break up.

347
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:32,083
There's something to be sorry about to the other person.

348
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,858
There are things that I feel sorry for you.

349
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:39,516
And I bet you have something sorry for me.

350
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:44,258
But still, I'm more sorry.

351
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,025
No.

352
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:55,308
If I say let's stay as friends, it's just for words, right?

353
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,841
Yes.

354
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,958
But I wish for your happiness.

355
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,691
I wish for you, too.

356
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,841
Didn't you miss me?

357
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:29,916
I was dying to see you.

358
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:32,941
Don't talk about dying.

359
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,308
Okay, I won't say that again.

360
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,300
I'm sorry. Are you upset?

361
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,183
No, I'm not.

362
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:40,800
- You are sulky.
- No, I'm not.

363
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,958
I'm not sulky but don't ever say that again.

364
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,241
Okay. So you're not upset?

365
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,800
No.

366
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,566
I want to be alone with you.

367
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:56,466
What do you want to do with me if we are alone?

368
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,975
Is there something you want to do?

369
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,891
I want to go to the amusement park wearing a school uniform,

370
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:09,308
go to Gyeongbokgung Palace wearing a Hanbok,

371
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:12,350
take photo booth photos with you,

372
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,800
and spend Christmas at Myeong-dong.

373
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,008
Okay. I haven't done any of those as well.

374
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:21,408
But those are all for the young kids to do in their early twenties.

375
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:24,558
I'm in my early twenties.

376
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,875
Yes, that's right.

377
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:30,000
You are in your early twenties.

378
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,916
Will you do all that with me?

379
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,975
Fine, you do whatever you want.

380
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,133
- Really?
- Yes.

381
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,100
Will you go with me?

382
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,110
- Yes.
- All four of them?

383
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,175
Sure.

384
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,941
Can't we just leave?

385
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:48,733
Well, it's a very special day today. I think we need to stay.

386
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,133
Right?

387
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,483
Let me use the bathroom.

388
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,125
I'll be right here.

389
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,866
I'm in shock.

390
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,850
Why, what's wrong?

391
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:36,266
I saw Yoon Won Sunbae and Joon Pyo kissing.

392
00:27:42,141 --> 00:27:44,366
That's possible.

393
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:48,716
But I think we would be more shocking to them.

394
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:51,366
Right, I guess so.

395
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,541
Wait, does Yoon Won also knows about us?

396
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:59,750
She figured it out when we went on that trip together.

397
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:05,133
Were we that obvious?

398
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,875
What's wrong if it is obvious?

399
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,583
We are together now.

400
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,308
Is it okay for you if people know about us?

401
00:28:12,308 --> 00:28:13,866
Yes.

402
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:18,050
I have no time to think about anything but you.

403
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:25,408
Sunbaenim.

404
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm sorry for being so rude the other day.

405
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:33,166
It's fine.

406
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,283
You weren't rude but a bit sassy.

407
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,500
What is it like to win?

408
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,908
Well...

409
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:50,450
I usually don't concede my defeat.

410
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,216
I don't know what to say.

411
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:57,566
Ji Hyun.

412
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:01,808
I realized the five senses weren't everything.

413
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,016
Just follow your senses.

414
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,591
Who knows what might happen?

415
00:29:17,366 --> 00:29:19,108

Do you know that game?

454
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,525
What game?

455
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:48,266
Take two steps back.

456
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:50,066
Come on.

457
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,283
If you take two steps away from me,

458
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,091
I'll...

459
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,458
take three steps toward you.

460
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:17,541
Take two steps forward.

461
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,683
If you take one step,

462
00:32:27,683 --> 00:32:29,750
two steps forward,

463
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:32,900
I will be here waiting.

464
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:41,250
What if someone sees us?

465
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,358
Who cares? I only see you.

466
00:32:45,916 --> 00:32:47,716
Sleepover at my place.

467
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,958
What about Joon Pyo?

468
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:55,525
I saw him leaving with Yoon Won earlier.

469
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:57,210
Really?

470
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:59,575
Then shall I?

471
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:08,325
Look at you!

472
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,041
Do you not like it?

473
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,775
It's cute.

474
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:16,875
Don't just treat me cute. You don't know what's coming.

475
00:33:19,016 --> 00:33:21,333
Are you laughing at me? Is this funny?

476
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,100
It is funny.
