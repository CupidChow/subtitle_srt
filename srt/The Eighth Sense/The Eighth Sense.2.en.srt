17
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,450
You almost dislocated my shoulder.

19
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,829
- You should've woken me up.
- You were so sound asleep.

20
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,400
Did you work yesterday as well?

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,290
Yes.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,996
Sleep a little more. Everyone is going to make the freshmen get super drunk later.

23
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,733
I can decide not to drink.

24
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,635
Wow, you have a strong spirit, freshman!

25
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:11,456
Right, what was your name again?

26
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:12,870
It's Kim Ji Hyun.

27
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,790
Oh, that's right.

28
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,332
What's your last name?

29
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:24,494
Oh, sorry. I'm Seo Jae Won.

30
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,514
You must be tired. Get some sleep.

31
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,270
Jae Won was our original vice president.

32
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,710
Jeong Min, who was taking the position while Jae Won was away, also went for military service.

33
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,885
So, once again, Jae Won is our vice president.

34
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:42,295
Does anyone have any objections?

35
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,663
I doubt it.

36
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,833
We'll use four rooms, two for men and two for women.

37
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,290
Can you announce the room for them?

38
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,550
Shall I?

39
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:55,207
Okay, I'll announce the rooms.

40
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,085
Room number one.

41
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:59,554
Park Tae Hyung, Ha Dong Joo,

42
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,798
Seo Jae Won,

43
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,824
Jang Dong Sik.

44
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:08,996
Okay, room number two. Jo Jang Ho, Kwon Cheol Hee,

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,374
and Kim Ji Hyun.

46
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,469
What are you doing?

47
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:18,264
Oh, let me announce the room assignments for women.

48
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:24,011
Now, let's unpack and get back together at noon. Dismissed!

49
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,056
Dong Sik, Dong Joo, let's go!

50
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,244
The room is quite small.

51
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,754
You're saying that for no reason.

52
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,956
I'm not saying it for no reason.

53
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:40,727
You should keep an eye on Yoon Won, so she doesn't misuse the club money.

54
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:44,565
Does it make sense that membership fee can't give us a room for two people each?

55
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:48,161
But this is more romantic than that.

56
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,563
Romantic? It needs to be spacious to be romantic.

57
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,590
Why did I end up sharing a room with you?

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,970
Why?

59
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,826
Don't you snore.

60
00:03:55,826 --> 00:04:00,372
How could you complain about the room when you just came out of the military barracks?

61
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:03,167
Maybe I should ask for a room change.

62
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:08,422
Change the room? If you leave, who will take care of me when I get drunk?

63
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:09,957
Get off!

64
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:12,301
I'm just teasing.

65
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:26,390
By the way... The guy you sat next to seemed familiar.

66
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,325
Where did I see him before?

67
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,746
I don't know.

68
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,206
Why did you sit next to him?

69
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,360
- No, it's not what you're thinking.
- It's because of Eun Ji, right?

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,115
No, I just took care of him because he was there. Just have this.

71
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,934
I like bananas.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,416
If you try to hook me up with Eun Ji again, you will die.

73
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,193
Okay, okay. I won't.

74
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,765
Hey, those two freshmen were pretty cute, right?

75
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,586
Older seniors like us should have a conscience. How could you even think of dating a freshman?

76
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,170
Hey, Jae Won. Love has no age or border limits.

77
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,470
The only limit is ranking.

78
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm heading out to help Yoon Won prepare.

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,028
- I can help you guys.
- No, you stay here.

80
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,096
- I'll help.
- You'd better stay here.

81
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,875
We're so lucky not to share the room with the seniors.

82
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,760
Especially with Tae Hyung.

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,371
If you shared a room with him, he would be ordering us to buy and bring stuff.

84
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,523
It would've been a nightmare.

85
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,763
What? A freshman is using something like that? Let me use some.

86
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:41,041
- Sure.
- Do you want some too?

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,410
I'll get sunburned anyway. I'm fine.

88
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,220
Sure.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,240
I forgot to bring a toothbrush.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,220
Just go and buy one.

91
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,754
Now let's officially start the first surfing of Free Bird this year!

92
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,776
New members, please come this way.

93
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,046
Please introduce yourselves.

94
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,070
Hello.

95
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,900
<i>Hello!</i>

96
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm Lee Bit Na from Acting major.

97
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm new to surfing. But I believe you'll teach me, right?

98
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,858
<i>Yes!</i>

99
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,510
Hello.

100
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,907
I'm Koh Ae Ri. I'm in Film major from the same Arts department as Bit Na.

101
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:39,389
I'll be sure to capture all your wonderful moments!

102
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,179
Next person.

103
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:53,020
Hello. I'm Kim Ji Hyun, a freshman.

104
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,305
Nice to meet you.

105
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,379
Wow! Great!

106
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,481
Okay, please return to your places.

107
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:09,712
We have both new members and some who are preparing to graduate soon.

108
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:16,660
Let's enjoy our best in the Free Bird this semester as well!

109
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:20,498
Oh, and please be careful. Safety comes first.

110
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:25,110
You can head to the surfing shop, change into your suits, and enjoy the two-hour session. Let's go!

111
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,479
Let's go!

112
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,198
I'm going to conquer the waves.

113
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:36,154
You take charge of the girls. I'll take on that boy.

114
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:38,047
Oh, okay.

115
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,192
Hold on a second. I think...

116
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,245
I'll take charge of that boy.

117
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,248
Why? You're a much better surfer than I am.

118
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:47,233
Teaching two people is too much for me.

119
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:53,005
I mean, it's more comfortable to teach the same gender.

120
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,683
There is no such thing when it comes to surfing.

121
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,569
Anyway, I want to take on the boy.

122
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,870
Whatever. Bit Na and Ae Ri!

123
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,890
Yes!

124
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,650
<i>Hey! Go! Come on!</i>

125
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,680
Ji Hyun, follow me.

126
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,797
How tall are you?

127
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,580
- I'm 6 feet.
- Oh, you're taller than I thought.

128
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,160
You don't know how to put this on, do you?

129
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,670
No.

130
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,190
Check this...

131
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:32,704
Putting your feet in plastic bags and sliding them on makes it much easier.

132
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,977
Give me your other foot.

133
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:46,368
Should we try it on?

134
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,525
Can you stand up now?

135
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,301
Your arm.

136
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,696
And the other one.

137
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:22,271
Turn around.

138
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,786
It's done now. You look good.

139
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,529
Thank you.

140
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,933
Where are you going?

141
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,702
You should help me zip up, too.

142
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,486
Oh, yes.

143
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:14,806
Let's head out.

144
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:36,503
So, why did you want to start surfing?

145
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:46,321
You joined this club to become friends with me, didn't you?

146
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,873
Sorry?

147
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,046
I never asked you to be my friend. You asked me first.

148
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm trying not to be afraid.

149
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,305
What?

150
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:10,530
Once I became an adult and moved to Seoul, I thought the world was a very scary place.

151
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,023
So I'm trying not to be scared.

152
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,168
You're so serious.

153
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,340
By the way, what's your major?

154
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,770
What would you guess?

155
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,580
Business major.

156
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,993
Is it that obvious?

157
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,179
Yes, very obvious.

158
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:38,724
Does it mean I look boring?

159
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,277
No. I'm kidding.

160
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,429
I just picked one randomly.

161
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,556
You are...

162
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:51,728
Looking at your face, are you in the Acting major?

163
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:52,880
I'm in Fine Arts.

164
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,020
Is that so?

165
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,998
What are you doing?

166
00:13:43,998 --> 00:13:46,358
- What?
- You got to lie down on your stomach.

167
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,348
Okay, when you've lied down like that,

168
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:56,560
swing your arms as if you're swimming.

169
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:03,065
Put your arms as close to the board as you can.

170
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:05,051
Okay.

171
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:12,609
Okay. By the way, do you know how to swim?

172
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,811
I guess so.

173
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:18,648
Did you join the surf club without knowing how to swim?

174
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:22,177
I grew up near a valley and used to swam there.

175
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:26,589
How could that be the same as swimming in the ocean?

176
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:32,136
Then let's do it together, starting in the shallows.

177
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,839
Okay. Let's try again.

178
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:37,618
Very nice.

179
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,587
Raise your upper body a bit more.

180
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,755
It's better to raise it as much as you can.

181
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,608
The more you raise your upper body, the less energy you use.

182
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,535
Okay. You're doing great.

183
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,470
Are you exhausted?

184
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,922
- Are you tired?
- No.

185
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,514
Go!

186
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:54,993
Put your arms as close to the board as possible.

187
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:58,388
Raise your upper body. I'll hold you. Keep going!

188
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:02,692
Okay, let's stop now.

189
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,778
Let's take a break.

190
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,444
The ocean is beautiful, isn't it?

191
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:15,547
It's always good to come to the ocean.

192
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,625
You can put it down.

193
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:30,236
Okay.

194
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,069
First, get on the surfing board and lie down.

195
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:46,069
That's good. Move a bit more to the front.

196
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,388
A little more. Okay.

197
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,375
Let's start with paddling.

198
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,666
Nice, nice. You're doing great.

199
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,649
That's right. You're a fast learner!

200
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,070
Take off!

201
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,803
Ji Hyun, are you okay?

202
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,799
More than half part of surfing is about plunging into the water. You'll have to get used to it.

203
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,192
- It was okay, right?
- Yes.

204
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:29,162
All right. Look at me.

205
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,880
Are you sure you're okay?

206
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,890
Yes, I'm good.

207
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,630
Take off!

208
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,884
Take off!

209
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:49,090
Are you okay?

210
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,593
Are you okay? A wave is coming!

211
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:25,060
The ramen that you eat when you get out of the water is the best one.

212
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:29,440
It's embarrassing because I wasn't in the water long enough to deserve this.

213
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,093
You must be cold. Have something warm to warm you up.

214
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,838
Thanks for the food.

215
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,389
Aren't you eating?

216
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:58,484
I'm keeping my weight in check.

217
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:02,160
But are you drinking a soda?

218
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,040
It's zero sugar.

219
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,576
Think that you had a taste of surfing today and rest now.

220
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:20,398
Since you experienced it intensely the first time, you'll be able to ride it without fear.

221
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:30,510
A lot of whip cream, please.

222
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,610
Okay.

223
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,689
Thank you.

224
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:38,874
Bye.

225
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:57,618
How come you never offer me a bite?

226
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,747
You said you're keeping your weight in check.

227
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:06,827
- Should I get one for you?
- No, I was just teasing you.

228
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:09,530
Just sit down and rest.

229
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,879
Oh, mango, mango. It's so yummy!

230
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:18,147
- Sunbae.
- Why are you calling me?

231
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:19,975
I don't like the freshman.

232
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:23,696
Those girls? You're just jealous because they are young and pretty, aren't you?

233
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:28,699
Not them. They can't bother me.

234
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,079
I'm talking about the boy.

235
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,565
Ji Hyun? What about him?

236
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:41,487
He's still a kid but polite, sweet, and cute.

237
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,960
I don't know. Just the sight of him annoys me.

238
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,977
I wonder why he annoyed our queen bee.

239
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,017
It's delicious.

240
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,666
Should we get going?

241
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,275
Yes.

242
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,516
I told you. Everyone will be forcing the freshmen into drinking.

243
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,643
So have this first.

244
00:20:20,643 --> 00:20:22,654
Thanks.

245
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,817
We've been in the ocean, so we need to take a shower now.

246
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,520
Let's go to the shower room.

247
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,080
Sorry?

248
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,242
I'll take a shower in my room.

249
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:41,848
But you have to return that surfing suit.

250
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,300
Right.

251
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:16,766
Why are you so shy about when we are both men?

252
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,553
Come next to me.

253
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,384
I'm not used to taking a shower with other people.

254
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,221
What are you going to do when you go to the army?

255
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:48,681
I'll head out to prepare dinner. Take your time.

256
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,390
Look at Dong Joo wearing pink.

257
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,237
All the guys will go crazy to sit and drink with the female freshmen.

258
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:14,465
- We have to protect them, okay?
- Sure, sure.

259
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:23,649
- Is there anything I can help you with?
- It's all right. Go sit over there, cutie.

260
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,352
Is there anything I can do for you?

261
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:37,997
No, we got this. Go take a seat.

262
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:41,351
I'm looking forward to the delicious barbecue that you cook. Thank you!

263
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,245
What a flirt!

264
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:49,092
We'll split the barbecue into three groups.

265
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:53,372
- Okay!
- Jae Won and I will eat over here with the freshmen.

266
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,316
Please don't change your seats until after the meal.

267
00:22:56,316 --> 00:23:00,752
Especially Dong Joo in pink. Behave!

268
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:06,075
Ae Ri, let me do it for you since you became an adult recently.

269
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:13,549
Sunbaenim, it's a bit embarrassing, but I'm a fast learner.

270
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:16,190
What was that?

271
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,070
That was incredible!

272
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,130
You're good at it!

273
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,992
Here's a shot for you.

274
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:26,100
It's a good start!

275
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,550
I underestimated the kids these days.

276
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,309
<i>- Cheers!
- Cheers!</i>

277
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:34,629
It tastes good.

278
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:40,208
- One more round!
- One more round! One more round!

279
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,423
Can I help you?

280
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:50,794
Oh, no. It's okay. Go back and make some friends.

281
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:55,066
Let me do it. I've worked at a pork place, so I've got loads of experience.

282
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:59,462
Shall we do it together, then?

283
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,070
Oh, be careful! Smoke goes in that direction.

284
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,720
Let's switch places.

285
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:17,229
- I can do better when I get drunker.
- All right!

286
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:22,327
- Thank you for grilling.
- Jae Won Sunbae! Jae Won Sunbae!

287
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,810
- Wow! It looks amazing.
- I'm starving.

288
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,656
Thank you for doing everything!

289
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:29,517
No, no. Ji Hyun did a great job.

290
00:24:29,517 --> 00:24:31,478
- Hey, have a drink!
- Yes, have a drink!

291
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,580
Their glasses are empty.

292
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,481
Let's all have another round!

293
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,342
My arm is going to fall if you don't do cheers soon!

294
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,903
Okay, nice!

295
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:46,818
Here's a question. Where do you guys live, Ae Ri and Bit Na?

296
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,854
- I live in Seocho-gu.
- You live in Seocho-gu! Got it.

297
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:52,916
- I live in Pyeongchang-dong.
- Wow, Pyeongchang-dong!

298
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,801
Where do you live, Jae Won?

299
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,204
Oh, I live in Bangbae-dong.

300
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,910
Oh, we live close by!

301
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,090
Please buy me a drink if we run into each other in the neighborhood.

302
00:25:03,092 --> 00:25:04,661
Of course, any time.

303
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:08,814
Jae Won Oppa, why are you so polite? You can relax around me.

304
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:11,226
Okay, I will. I hope you enjoy the food.

305
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:15,721
Bit Na, it's our club's rule to call seniors by their title.

306
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:19,025
- Yes! I'll be careful. No more Oppa.
- It's okay!

307
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:23,113
It's all good. Shall we have another round?

308
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:24,648
- Yes!
- Okay!

309
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,391
- Wait. Hold on a second.
- What is it?

310
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,609
Ji Hyun, where do you live?

311
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:31,620
I live in the dorm.

312
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,542
Okay, let's have another drink! Cheers!

313
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:38,903
Have a drink... I'm sorry!

314
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:45,827
If you're done eating, let's get together and enjoy the campfire. Everyone, follow me!

315
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:48,750
Let's go!

316
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,950
Cheers!

317
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,137
- Let's go.
- Yes, I'm coming.

318
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,299
Follow Yoon Won!

319
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:21,737
Jae Won, it's so hard to see you! Why didn't you contact me after you were discharged?

320
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:26,517
It felt really empty without you, Jae Won. I've missed you.

321
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:31,238
I also missed you guys more than the friends from my major.

322
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,425
Are you applying to get a job now?

323
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:35,802
Yes, I should.

324
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,590
Don't worry about Jae Won. Look at his face! He'll pass all job interviews.

325
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,250
That's true.

326
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,351
Jae Won, are you dating anyone lately?

327
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,312
A girl from my major has been waiting for you to return from the army.

328
00:26:46,312 --> 00:26:48,380
I can set you two up.

329
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,799
Having you guys around me is enough for me.

330
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:55,254
That's a lame answer!

331
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:57,824
Forget about that, and why don't you start a drinking game?

332
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,318
I just came back from the military! I don't know anything.

333
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,494
True.

334
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:05,013
- Hey, let's play the "Like You" game.
- What's that?

335
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,967
- Don't you guys know the "Like You" game?
- What is it?

336
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,944
Let's start the "Like You" game. You can learn while you drink!

337
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,705
Since we had some drinks, shall we play the "Like You" game?

338
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:15,408
Yes, yes! I like it, like it, like it!

339
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:17,000
I like you, Bit Na.

340
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,390
I like you, too.

341
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,922
I like you, Dong Sik.

342
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:22,670
I like you, too. I like you, Ae Ri.

343
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,390
Rejected!

344
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,227
He got rejected, so he lost the game!

345
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,088
Drink up! It's time for you to drink the penalty drink.

346
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:33,931
Bottoms up! Drink until there's nothing left!

347
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:35,728
You're the man!

348
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,172
This game is fun! Let's play another round.

349
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:38,990
Ae Ri, I didn't think you would do that to me.

350
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,893
Of course, it's just a game!

351
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,071
- Hey, let's do it one more time. It's fun.
- Okay, I'll start.

352
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:47,840
Since we had some drinks, shall we play the "Like You" game?

353
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,202
Yes, yes! I like it, like it, like it!

354
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,821
- I like you, Tae Hyung.
- I like you, too.

355
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,332
- I like you, Bit Na.
- I like you, too.

356
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:59,043
- I like you, Ae Ri.
- I like you, too.

357
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:01,529
- I like you, Yoon Won.
- I like you, too.

358
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:04,256
- I like you, Jae Won.
- I like you, too.

359
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:06,125
I like you, Ji Hyun.

360
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:11,130
What do we do now?

361
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:16,376
He didn't say he liked him or rejected him, right?

362
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:22,033
Both of you, drink! Both of you, drink!

363
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,536
Yes! Both of you, drink!

364
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:27,329
Guys, do it!

365
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,900
What on earth is this scene?!

366
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,720
Hey, bottoms up!

367
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,125
Oh my, what's going on?

368
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,850
That was crazy.

369
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:47,242
Guys, let's chat or sing a song.

370
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:53,145

<i>- Hello?</i>
- What are you doing?

386
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,181
<i>I'm drinking. Why did you call me?</i>

387
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,299
Just because...

388
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,142
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

389
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:03,786
Yeah.

390
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,798
<i>That's good. Have fun!</i>

391
00:31:09,192 --> 00:31:11,002
Do you have anything you'd like to talk about?

392
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,000
<i>Da Kyung, my roommate, is away on a trip. </i>

393
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,610
<i> Would you come over to my dorm room?</i>

394
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,361
That crazy bastard.

395
00:31:45,595 --> 00:31:47,263
Hey!

396
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,667
How long are you going to be like this?

397
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:03,579
Like what?

398
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,883
Until when are you going to treat me like I'm invisible?

399
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:11,295
Eun Ji, I don't have any feelings left for you.

400
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:14,206
No good feelings nor bad feelings.

401
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,260
It's so cold tonight!

402
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,757
Let's talk somewhere else.

403
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:36,145
Let's talk here.

404
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,649
Let's stop making things uglier.

405
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:45,420
I was waiting while you were in the army.

406
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:49,208
Why did you want to break up overnight?

407
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:52,344
Are you asking because you really don't know?

408
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,141
How many times do I have to tell you that it was a misunderstanding?

409
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:01,087
Do you think I can't talk about this?

410
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:03,155
About what?

411
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:11,838
I'm keeping my basic courtesy for you, Eun Ji.

412
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:15,926
I've never told anyone why we broke up.

413
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,447
I'm still coming to the surf club because I don't want you to get blamed.

414
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:26,020
So please have some bare minimum of consideration for me.

415
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,396
I'm begging you.

416
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,816
Then have some respect for me too.

417
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:33,227
Why did you want to break up overnight when we were so good together?

418
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:37,489
How many times do I have to tell you that nothing happened between me and Min Kyu?

419
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:30,801
Is it your new hobby to eavesdrop on my conversations?

420
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:32,979
What?

421
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,349
I didn't hear anything. I was listening to music.

422
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,545
Are you okay?

423
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,599
I'm jealous of you.

424
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:00,681
You don't know what I mean, do you?

425
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm jealous of you, Hyung.

426
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,955
Of what?

427
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:17,523
You look like you're not afraid of anything.

428
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:20,142
Then, are you afraid of many things?

429
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:30,561
That's just because you still have many things you don't know.

430
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,351
By the way, you finally called me "Hyung."

431
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:43,506
Oh, right. It's the club's rule that we call seniors by the title...
