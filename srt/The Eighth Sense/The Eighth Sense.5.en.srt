2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,260
Well, anyway.

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:12,245
This is how movies portray and...

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,014
movies as an art form...

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,841
Deliver? Express?

6
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:19,385
The things that we wanted to do, like that...

7
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:21,646
<i>[What an idiot. Is she doing that as a presentation?]</i>

8
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,734
This is the end of our presentation on Film Art History.

9
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,018
Thank you.

10
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:38,635
Well done. The next presenters are...

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,225
Ae Ri and Ji Hyun, right?

12
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,334
Yes, Professor.

13
00:00:44,334 --> 00:00:47,313
Which movie did you guys choose?

14
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:52,334
We chose "I'm a Cyborg, But That's Ok" by director Park Chan Wook.

15
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,503
Okay.

16
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:59,859
Don't try to cut corners, even if this is an elective Liberal Arts class.

17
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,185
See you next week.

18
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,537
Thank you.

19
00:01:02,537 --> 00:01:04,638
Bye.

20
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,841
Hey. Do you want to skip class?

21
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,714
I can't. It's my major class.

22
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:17,852
There's a time for everything.

23
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:20,788
If we don't skip class as freshmen, then when else?

24
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:25,910
You're living in a vibrant college town after moving to Seoul.

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,354
Did you even have a chance to enjoy it?

26
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,474
You are always stuck in your dorm or working part-time jobs.

27
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,888
How about I show you the real Seoul?

28
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,892
- Stop it.
- Please?

29
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,610
- I can't.
- Okay?

30
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:46,506
Shall we?

31
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,899
Yes! Let's go.

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,697
Hello, Sunbaenim!

33
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,000
- It's the freshmen.
- Hi, guys. Where are you going?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,327
We are going to skip class and enjoy the fun of Seoul.

35
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,697
Oh, the fun of Seoul.

36
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:09,992
Don't forget to send the "Sorry for missing class, but I was sick" message to the professor, okay?

37
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:12,282
Of course, I know what to do.

38
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,975
Ditching class! It's a good time.

39
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,560
- Have fun.
- Okay.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,579
Do you have any plans for tonight?

41
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,597
No, nothing much.

42
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:21,875
Are you working tonight?

43
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,492
No, I'm not.

44
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:27,371
How about an impromptu get-together with the club seniors tonight?

45
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,414
What are you guys doing tonight?

46
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,832
Nothing. I love it.

47
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:31,259
- You love it?
- I love it.

48
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,590
Okay, I will call you after class.

49
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,710
Okay. Call me.

50
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,359
Oh, Ae Ri.

51
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,676
Yes?

52
00:02:40,676 --> 00:02:42,636
Will you call Bit Na as well?

53
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:43,955
Yes, I will.

54
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,847
Thank you.

55
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,616
- Take it easy.
- Today's weather is amazing.

56
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,779
That's a good time.

57
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,838
Yes, indeed.

58
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,797
I'm so jealous.

59
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:57,267
I hope Bit Na shows up.

Where do you usually shop in the countryside?

69
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,830
I usually buy things online.

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,583
Or Joon Pyo and I would go to Daegu during the weekends.

71
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,260
I see.

72
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,177
Are you not shopping?

73
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,062
I'm looking around.

74
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,677
Hey, if you walk around Seoul wearing clothes you bought online,

75
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,507
you will definitely bump into someone wearing the same outfit.

76
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:28,408
Sometimes hidden gems are in vintage shops.

77
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:35,046
It means you will unlikely bump into someone wearing the same outfit.

78
00:04:35,046 --> 00:04:37,926
Men's wear is over there.

79
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:44,925
Ji Hyun, how do I look?

80
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,594
Cute, right?

81
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,678
It suits you.

82
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,733
This is so mine.

83
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,479
How do I look?

84
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,830
Cute! It looks good on you.

85
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,099
- Right?
- Yes.

86
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,917
Should I wear this tonight?

87
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,061
Yes. Why not?

88
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,763
I wasn't wearing this earlier.

89
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,856
So the seniors might notice I just shopped.

90
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:34,976
Hey, Kim Ji Hyun!

91
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,328
Stop being so self-conscious.

92
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:42,265
Hey, there is nothing wrong with spending your own money on clothes.

93
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,768
You're so frustrating.

94
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:45,177
- Right?
- Yes.

95
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,412
I should get this.

96
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,021
Sounds great.

97
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:52,875
You should pay for tonight, Yoon Won, since you started it.

98
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,564
Is it such a waste for you to buy dinner for the freshmen?

99
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,878
Or we can use Jae Won's mom's credit card!

100
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,363
Do you think my mom's credit card is some magic lamp?

101
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,965
You also have your mother's card.

102
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,557
Dude. The limit is different.

103
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:11,220
Mine is a debit card, not a credit card.

104
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,981
Yours is the metallic premium credit card.

105
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,099
Cut it off now.

106
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,276
Just split the bill in three.

107
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,828
Tell them where to meet us.

108
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:21,722
I don't have their numbers.

109
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,748
How about you, Jae Won?

110
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:27,009
Yes, I have their numbers.

111
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,454
I'll contact them.

112
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,423
Wait a second.

113
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,766
Can you move to the side a bit?

114
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:44,019
One second.

115
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,938
I can't get the right angle.

116
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,042
Can you move a bit more?

117
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,852
One moment.

118
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,544
Okay.

119
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,104
Can I eat now?

120
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:04,823
No, take a photo of me.

121
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,618
Now, now.

122
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,589
Let me see.

123
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,792
Don't you know the basics of photography?

124
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:35,819
The angle should be from the bottom to the top. So I look well-proportioned.

125
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,890
I think it looks good.

126
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,492
Ji Hyun. There's a certain vibe of photos for social media.

127
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:48,391
Flip the phone upside down and try it again.

128
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,418
- Like this?
- Yes.

129
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,671
Try it again.

130
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:58,518
Yes, that's right.

131
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,648
Did they respond?

132
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,641
No. I guess they're having fun.

133
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,093
No answer.

134
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,995
Just call them.

135
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,596
Yes, just call them.

136
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:21,908
Call? I never had a chance to call Ji Hyun before.

137
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:28,279
You fool. Are you seeing each other or something?

138
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,591
Are you playing hard to get?

139
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:31,944
I mean, it sounds like it.

140
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,790
I'm the one who feels awkward talking to Bit Na.

141
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:41,478
What I'm trying to say is he might feel uncomfortable getting a call from a senior.

142
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:43,997
Just call him, you fool!

143
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:46,107
Come on.

144
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,754
Okay. I'll be back then.

145
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:51,756
Be back from what?

146
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:53,498
The call.

147
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,427
Why would you go out to make a call?

148
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,170
Where are you going?

149
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,457
What are you doing?

150
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:14,744
What? Oh, I'm retouching my photos.

151
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:17,163
Okay. Uploaded.

152
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:19,491
Quick, go like my photo.

153
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:21,493
Like?

154
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,798
Seriously?

155
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:30,877
You have an account, right?

156
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,297
- I do, but...
- Give it to me.

157
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,637
Wow, you have zero posts.

158
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:43,106
Well, first, let's follow each other.

159
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,558
I'll press like, okay?

160
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:46,485
Okay.

161
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:53,174
Of course, a thoughtful friend would add hashtags for me.

162
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,483
Jae Won is calling you.

163
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,332
Go ahead, answer it.

164
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:10,050
Right.

165
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,221
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

166
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,319
Hello?

167
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,421
<i>Hi, Ji Hyun. This is Jae Won.</i>

168
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,584
Yes, Hyung. Hello.

169
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:40,556
I sent you the location for tonight, but you didn't answer my message.

170
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,992
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't check my phone.</i>

171
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:48,120
No, don't be sorry. It's okay.

172
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,874
I sent you the location and time. See you there.

173
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:55,303
<i>Okay, I'll see you there.</i>

174
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:57,038
Okay.

175
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:01,385
See you soon.

176
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,144

<i>Thank you, Hyung.</i>

178
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,230
The new freshmen are certainly different.

179
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,432
When we were freshmen, we always arrived earlier to set up the table before drinking with the seniors.

180
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,552
And that was the courtesy.

181
00:11:27,552 --> 00:11:28,996
- Park Tae Hyung.
- What?

182
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:32,381
Don't you remember when you got beaten up by the seniors for not grilling the meat?

183
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,959
Don't be the same jerk.

184
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,050
I think the fact that you got an exemption from the military is a nation's fortune.

185
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,530
What?

186
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,600
I don't even want to imagine being in the army with him.

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,160
Why not?

188
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,931
How dare a woman say that.

189
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,751
Do you want to get drafted too?

190
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,871
Guys with low self-esteem always say women need to get drafted too.

191
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,990
Guys, stop it.

192
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,885
- Shame on you.
- Sunbaenim, hello!

193
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,163
- Hi, Ae Ri.
- Welcome!

194
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:03,789
Hello, Cutiepie.

195
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,157
Come sit here.

196
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,233
Welcome, Cutie.

197
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,137
Where's Bit Na?

198
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:14,174
She had prior plans tonight.

199
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,727
See, I told you they're different.

200
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:20,840
Back when we were freshmen when the seniors called us to drink,

201
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,201
we dropped everything to be there. Wasn't that the tradition?

202
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,453
- Welcome, guys. Have a drink.
- Tradition...

203
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,305
- Cheers!
- Let's drink.

204
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:31,157
Cheers! Cheers!

205
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:33,360
Cheers!

206
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:38,650
The soju tastes sweet today.

207
00:12:39,765 --> 00:12:41,985
Hyung, I'll grill it.

208
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:45,972
I mean, Sunbaenim.

209
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,230
Excuse me, Sir.

210
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,157
Can we have another pair of tongs?

211
00:12:56,157 --> 00:12:58,118
I can cook it by myself.

212
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:01,145
How can you grill by yourself for five people?

213
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,942
You two are in Art School, right?

214
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:09,004
You must be free from job applications then.

215
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:13,851
Yes, but the uncertainty of our future worries us.

216
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:17,004
You're right. What will you do for a living?

217
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,697
That's right, Yoon Won. You're applying to the open recruitment this semester, right?

218
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,660
I'm staying in school to stay as a to-be-graduate.

219
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,695
- Of course, I'm applying.
- True.

220
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:27,998
You'll start applying next semester, right, Jae Won?

221
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:29,608
What?

222
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,852
I'm not sure yet.

223
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,337
I told you. Don't waste your time worrying about Jae Won.

224
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:38,417
Tae Hyung, you really need to watch your mouth.

225
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,460
Why?

226
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,045
What about Jae Won?

227
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:47,784
Ae Ri. Jae Won's father's company makes 150 billion won per year.

228
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:50,229
That's not including the subsidiaries, just the headquarters.

229
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:54,124
How do you know more about my dad's company than I do?

230
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,769
I like to look stuff up like that on the internet.

231
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,930
Normally, if you want to inherit the company like that,

232
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,310
you work for about 3 to 4 years at a conglomerate for experience

233
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,813
and then join the dad's company as an executive.

234
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,008
You usually inherit the company that way.

235
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:16,268
If Jae Won is looking for a job, his supervisor will be all over him to help.

236
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:17,790
Plus, he doesn't even need one.

237
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,933
I didn't know you were inheriting a company.

238
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,794
Are you an only child?

239
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,412
Luckily, he is.

240
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:27,999
He's very fortunate. Siblings would complicate things.

241
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,844
Are you angry, Jae Won?

242
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:36,115
If you are, maybe you can help me become the outside director.

243
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:38,826
Someone shut his mouth.

244
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,682
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

245
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,192
You like Bit Na, right?

246
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:55,022
Well... I think we have a mutual attraction.

247
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:56,720
Did she say something?

248
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,689
No, nothing much.

249
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,083
Isn't that worse?

250
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,032
What do you mean?

251
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:13,285
If you like someone, wouldn't you tell your best friend first?

252
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:15,363
It's not like she likes you or not,

253
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,474
but if she didn't even mention you,

254
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:19,601
I think it means you are out of her interest.

255
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:23,871
Also, she cares about guys' faces a lot.

256
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:27,317
I'm not saying you're not handsome.

257
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,936
But she's really picky.

258
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,823
That's right. She talked about Jae Won once.

259
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:35,783
She said you're so cool.

260
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,146
Wise girl.

261
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:43,959
You guys are smart.

262
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,094
Do you want another glass, Tae Hyung?

263
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,861
Hyung.

264
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,772
Aren't you drinking too much?

265
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,880
Are you okay?

266
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,512
Hey.

267
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:30,706
Yes?

268
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:33,524
Do you have any siblings?

269
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:36,794
I have a younger sister.

270
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,988
Oh...

271
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,032
I see.

272
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,384
Are you close with your sister?

273
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:48,515
I didn't like her rebellious side,

274
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:52,810
but she was nice to me when I saw her recently.

275
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,005
Be nice to her.

276
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,590
You are not acting like yourself.

277
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,571
Hey, what is "acting like myself"?

278
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,775
That's up to you.

279
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,136
Why is he so drunk today?

280
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:06,523
I've never seen Jae Won this drunk since our freshmen time.

281
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,938
You bring him to his house.

282
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,031
Me? Why me?

283
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,119
I live in the opposite direction.

284
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,472
Jae Won took drunk you to your home so many times.

285
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,365
How can't you do that once?

286
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:22,476
I'll take him to his place.

287
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,793
Great.

288
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:24,953
I owe him some stuff, too.

289
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,729
It's all good now, right?

290
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:29,240
Ae Ri, do you want me to walk you home, too?

291
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,651
I'm fine.

292
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,620
A guy walking a girl home? It's an ancient rule.

293
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,866
You are so cool.

294
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,328
Yoon Won will send you the address.

295
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,012
Let's go, guys.

296
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:42,871
Good night.

297
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,623
All right, see you!

298
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,833
Get home safe.

299
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,517
Bye, guys.

300
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,635
- Bye.
- Can we really go?

301
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:51,313
Don't worry about me.

302
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:53,448
Good night.

303
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:55,224
Bye.

304
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,600
Hyung.

305
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,582
It's that house.

306
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,369
Are you waking up a bit now?

307
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,363
Let's keep going.

308
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:41,589
It would've been helpful if you sobered up sooner.

309
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,166
What? What did you just say?

310
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,126
Nothing, nothing.

311
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,671
I said you are still cute when you're drunk.

312
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:52,240
Hey, did you say, "I'm still cute when I'm drunk?"

313
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,651
Does that mean I'm always cute?

314
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,786
Yes, you are very cute.

315
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,109
Your parents might see you.

316
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,904
Drink this and sober up.

317
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,791
Thank you.

318
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,525
Hyung.

319
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,410
Yes?

320
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,605
I don't know what happened to you,

321
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,332
but you got this.

322
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:28,984
And call me anytime you need me.

323
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,320
Bye.

324
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,417
Thank you.

325
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,927
You already thanked me.

326
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:52,265
You can't... kiss me today.

327
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:55,494
When did I kiss you?

328
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,183
Get inside now.

329
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,927
- Okay, I'll get going.
- Bye.

330
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,441
- Bye.
- Bye.

331
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:43,359
<i>Open the door.</i>

332
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,078
<i>Open right now!</i>

333
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,739
<i>What time did you come home from drinking?</i>

334
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:09,118
<i>When will you get yourself together?</i>

335
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,254
<i>You're always drinking!</i>

336
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,574
<i>Close your eyes, Hyung.</i>

337
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:25,259
<i>My eyes?</i>

338
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,210
<i>Open your eyes now.</i>

339
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:04,649
<i>I wanted to buy you a better camera for your birthday,</i>

340
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,510
<i>but I couldn't save more money.</i>

341
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:16,652
<i>This is the best camera in the world.</i>

342
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:20,073
<i>Promise me you will become a great photographer with this camera.</i>

343
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:23,350
<i>And take lots of pictures of me too.</i>

344
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,672
<i>Thank you.</i>

345
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,186
Jae Jin bought this for me!

346
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,815
What are you up to now?

347
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,287
Do you want to go to the beach with me?

348
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,955
When you first came here,

349
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:03,617
no one in the hospital thought you were a high school student.

350
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:06,731
Your attitude, manner, and the way you talk,

351
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:12,333
all made us wonder if you matured earlier or if you were taught well.

352
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,404
All your worries,

353
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:20,800
not doing what you want to do because you do not want to let your parents down,

354
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,321
and trying hard to be a good person to everyone because you do not want to disappoint others.

355
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,256
Don't you think it might be all because of your younger brother?

356
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:38,135
Your younger brother, who got into an accident while with you,

357
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,938
your younger brother, who you couldn't protect,

358
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:45,059
and you are struggling to live your life for him as well.

359
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,413
That will never be healed.

360
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:52,023
You just have to carry it with you.

361
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:54,551
It's something to shake off

362
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:57,196
a little by little every day.

363
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,975
I'm trying as well.

364
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:03,410
But it's not easy.

365
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,917
What makes you happy the most these days?

366
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,564
I got a new friend.

367
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:27,819
How do you feel when you are with that new friend?

368
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,921
I just feel comfortable.

369
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,848
We just became friends.

370
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:35,467
And it's not like we spend a lot of time together.

371
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,621
But he is the most comfortable friend I have right now.

372
00:26:38,621 --> 00:26:41,916
I don't have to try so hard in front of him.

373
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,519
I don't have to be someone I'm not.

374
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,840
And I'm happy when I'm with him.

375
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,127
Why not make the relationship deeper?

376
00:26:56,464 --> 00:27:00,401
I don't want my rash decision to make him unhappy.

377
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:03,520
Just by listening to your story,

378
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,961
I can tell that he offers you a place to rest.

379
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:14,046
I hope you can build a good relationship without crossing the line.

380
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,902
You know the answer to this concern is also on you, right?

381
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:21,155
Yes, I know.

382
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:30,230
Is your dad still aggressive?

383
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,879
How is he getting worse?

384
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,940
See you in two weeks.

385
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:45,627
Doctor. I have so many assignments these days.

386
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:48,449
Can I get a month's worth of prescription?

387
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:51,703
You can't do that, sir.

388
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,229
I need to do my job.

389
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,523
I will give you three weeks' worth.

390
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,660
Thank you.
