<i>[Ji Sub Lim]</i>

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>[Jun Taek Oh]</i>

3
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:10,780
<i>[The Eighth Sense]</i>

4
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,250
Let me make an announcement.

5
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,430
First of all, the school

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,068
banned our surfing trip that was scheduled to happen in May.

7
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,009
I've been looking forward to this trip since the midterms.

8
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,881
Sunbae, one of our members got into an accident. We can't do anything about it.

9
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:42,952
Sunbae, but that accident didn't happen during an official club trip.

10
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:45,496
It happened during their personal trip.

11
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,374
Does this make sense to you?

12
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:52,837
Eun Ji, how can you say that after what happened to a member of our club?

13
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:55,323
Eun Ji is right about this.

14
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,719
He got into an accident during a private trip.

15
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,164
And his parents heard about it, called the school and made such a big deal out of it.

16
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:08,009
By the way, why did Jae Won and Ji Hyun go on a trip together in the first place?

17
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,920
That's true.

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,716
Doesn't it make more sense for Jae Won to go on a surf trip with Tae Hyung?

19
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,985
Tae Hyung, didn't he say anything to you?

20
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,011
No.

21
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,782
Now that I think about it, it is strange.

22
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:26,410
I wasn't going to go on this upcoming surf trip anyway because I had to apply for jobs.

23
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,847
So, yes. Let's just quit everything.

24
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:42,194
Also, I want to share the final decision made by the school.

25
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:47,099
Our club has been officially removed from the club list.

26
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,745
That makes no sense.

27
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,206
Yoon Won.

28
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:57,402
You and I are the ones who worked hard to get the club approved.

29
00:02:57,402 --> 00:02:59,898
Remember how we did it?

30
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:05,826
How can some freshman's accident ruin everything we worked so hard to build?

31
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,644
Sunbaenim.

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,298
"Some freshman?"

33
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:15,251
How can you say that when you know what happened to him?

34
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,288
How dare you talk right now when you're just a freshman?

35
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:19,448
I'm your senior.

36
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,244
You dislike freshmen so much,

37
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:27,387
but then, why were you chasing Bit Na when she's also a freshman?

38
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:29,008
Listen to what this girl is saying.

39
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:29,934
"This girl?"

40
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,843
Yes.

41
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,438
Did you call me "this girl?"

42
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:35,155
Yes.

43
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:40,736
I'm going to report you to the school.

44
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:43,996
Go ahead. Do it. Go do it now!

45
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,991
Enough, guys.

46
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,203
Apologize to Ae Ri, Tae Hyung.

47
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,696
Why do I have to?

48
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,439
Come on, Tae Hyung.

49
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,535
Sorry... Is that enough for you?

50
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:04,993
But really, baseball, basketball, judo, and even hiking,

51
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:07,838
all those clubs are dangerous as well.

52
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:09,825
Ending our club seems too harsh.

53
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:13,319
But all those other clubs

54
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,104
didn't have people dying.

55
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:21,710
I really held my tongue because you guys are seniors...

56
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,772
but are you guys still human beings?

57
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:29,942
Don't you know what's important here?

58
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,920
Seriously...

59
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,672
Hey.

60
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,442
How dare you speak like that?

61
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:39,353
Do you think your seniors are a joke?

62
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:40,905
You're too young to know what you're talking about.

63
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,548
Stop it right now!

64
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,611
We are not here to fight.

65
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:54,892
We gathered today to share the school's decision and to hear everyone's feedback.

66
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,070
Why isn't Seo Jae Won here?

67
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,223
It's been a month since I last saw him.

68
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:01,075
Shouldn't he be here?

69
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,093
Tae Hyung, please.

70
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,400
"Please", what?

71
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,788
Nevermind.

72
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,226
Why did you gather us here when we were all busy with job applications and exams?

73
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,311
It's enough, so cut it off.

74
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,580
Let's stop wasting our time.

75
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:27,640
Hey. Stop whispering and say it to my face.

76
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,678
Say what?

77
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,393
What did you say?

78
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,604
What did I say?

79
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,889
- Please stop it, Sunbae.
- Hey, you.

80
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,016
- How dare you look straight into my eyes?
- Sunbae.

81
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,235
How dare you!

82
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:45,561
- Sunbaenim, please.
- Stay out of this.

83
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:46,979
Do you think you are better than me just because you're the senior?

84
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,972
- Say that again.
- Eun Ji.

85
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,365
I said, do you think you are better than me?

86
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:50,700
- Please stop it.
- Hey, get out.

87
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,701
Eun Ji, get out of the room.

88
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,644
Out!

89
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,559
It's okay.

90
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,366
- I'm sorry...
- It's okay.

91
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,134
I feel bad for Ji Hyun.

92
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,578
It's okay.

93
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,887
Hey. Isn't this strange?

94
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,283
What is?

95
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,226
Do you mean about ending the club?

96
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,396
There's nothing we can do about it.

97
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,247
No, not that.

98
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,317
I'm talking about Jae Won going on a trip only with that freshman boy.

99
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,005
I mean, they just met.

100
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,677
No way.

101
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:35,703
Right?

102
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,379
No.

103
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,832
But still, it's strange.

104
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,209
Something's off.

105
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:52,677
Here.

106
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,340
Oh, no.

107
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,409
It's totally broken.

108
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:01,795
What happened?

109
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:05,206
Can it be fixed?

110
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,496
If it's broken this badly,

111
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:14,791
it's impossible to fix it.

112
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,874
I can get you the same model.

113
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:26,045
But they charge a premium for this model now,

114
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,008
so it got pretty expensive.

115
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:33,234
Well, I'll give you a good deal.

116
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,704
No, it's okay. I don't want a new camera.

117
00:07:54,532 --> 00:08:00,685
From the mise-en-scène perspective, film art plays a very important role.

118
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:03,833
This is the end of my presentation on film art history.

119
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,067
Thank you.

120
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:11,840
Okay.

121
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,578
Next week's presenter is Ae Ri, right?

122
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:18,949
Oh, yes, Professor.

123
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,294
I gave you an extension due to the situation, so make sure you do well.

124
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,805
Okay, Professor.

125
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:30,924
Okay. That's it for today. Class dismissed.

126
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:43,119
You finally came to the class, Jae Won. You're alive.

127
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,585
- TA.
- Yes?

128
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:48,794
Did you take attendance?

129
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,654
Yes, Sir.

130
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,367
Oh, Jae Won. I heard you weren't well.

131
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,729
Good to see you.

132
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:01,573
Come to my office after class.

133
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,759
Okay, let's begin the class.

134
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,870
Chapter Six. Open page 142.

135
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:17,589
Oppa, you are done with the research, right?

136
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:25,529
This is the draft of our slide show. Nice, right?

137
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:27,808
Yes.

138
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:30,669
So how should we conclude it?

139
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,446
Do whatever you want.

140
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,735
Don't you think we should do this together?

141
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,122
I don't know.

142
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:47,118
Let's work on this together after class.

143
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:06,937
Everyone, please send your slide shows through email by next Wednesday.

144
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,642
We are seniors now,

145
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,661
so let's get ourselves together.

146
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,063
Please try to drink less.

147
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,132
And be careful, always.

148
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,775
Careful.

149
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,030
And don't die like somebody we know.

150
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,195
You jerk.

151
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:34,105
Jae Won, what's going on with you lately?

152
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:37,594
I've been ignoring your bad attendance,

153
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:40,138
but you're not even looking for a job.

154
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:44,834
And you even acted violently in class today.

155
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,812
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:55,520
You know I've been internally selected for your father's company's upcoming outside executive role, right?

157
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,482
But if you act like this, I don't know how to look at your father.

158
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:09,849
But since today's incident happened in front of me and everyone else in the class,

159
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,612
I have to refer it to the Disciplinary Board.

160
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,840
Okay, I understand.

161
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,304
So you should've hit him somewhere private.

162
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,848
I don't know how to help you.

163
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,855
If you have nothing more to say, excuse me.

164
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,573
What? Sure.

165
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,392
Take... take care, okay?

166
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,449
Yes, hello?

167
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,543
<i>Hello, this is the Administration Office.</i>

168
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,454
<i>Are you student Seo Jae Won from Business School?</i>

169
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:04,556
Yes, that's me.

170
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:08,844
<i>I called you because of the in-school assault incident on the 29th.</i>

171
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,479
<i>Are you available to talk right now?</i>

172
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,195
Yes, go on.

173
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:20,973
<i>It has been confirmed that the case is to be referred to the Disciplinary Board.</i>

174
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:26,517
<i>The committee will be held next Wednesday with the on-campus advisors.</i>

175
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:29,856
<i>So make sure you come to school next Wednesday.</i>

176
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,858
Okay.

177
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:35,036
<i>All right. See you next week.</i>

178
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,796
<i>[Park Tae Hyung]</i>

179
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,970
<i>The person you call is not available. This call will be forwarded to the voicemail after the beep—</i>

180
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,837
If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.

181
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,239
We share a history.

182
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,899
Sure.

183
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,663
Should we go to the pork stew place that you like?

184
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,332
But you didn't like that place.

185
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:26,619
I'll go there for you tonight to celebrate you coming back to your senses.

186
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,223
No, it's okay.

187
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,750
Let's go home. It's late.

188
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:44,344
My feet hurt a little. I shouldn't have worn these heels.

189
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,340
Oppa, wait.

190
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,998
Let's go.

191
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,293
Why didn't you visit recently?

192
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:26,214
I almost couldn't pay my rent because you stopped coming.

193
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,911
You know every minute counts for the consultation fee, right?

194
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,033
I was in a state...

195
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,438
where I didn't even have the energy to come and get my prescription.

196
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:47,835
Did you think about extreme decisions?

197
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,868
It's a relief

198
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,147
that you are here today.

199
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,632
Do you know when the hardest time is in my job?

200
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:13,569
It's when my patients commit suicide.

201
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,207
That's when I don't know what to do.

202
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:22,113
Whether I should attend the funeral or not.

203
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:29,043
In a way, I was the one who knew about the patient the most.

204
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,420
Do you go to those funerals?

205
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,583
Even the Association has a split opinion.

206
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:41,204
But the rule is not to attend for the protection of the doctor.

207
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,399
But I still go.

208
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,109
Why?

209
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:50,164
We waste so much time staring at our phones every day.

210
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:51,825
As a human being,

211
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:57,203
it's not that hard to make time to say goodbye for one last time.

212
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:05,819
Anyway, tell me more.

213
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,975
Do you remember the new friend I told you about?

214
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:13,821
Yes, the friend who became your refuge.

215
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:17,366
I jumped the gun too early.

216
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,046
My selfishness deepened the relationship.

217
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:25,458
And I went to that refuge for shelter.

218
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:33,314
But as I worried, I made my friend suffer.

219
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,954
Psychologically?

220
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,671
No.

221
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,257
Physically.

222
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,519
We went on a trip and almost got into big trouble—

223
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,413
No, we did have a big accident.

224
00:16:48,232 --> 00:16:51,459
He almost died in the ICU.

225
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,656
Is your friend okay now?

226
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:01,035
Yes, thankfully.

227
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,180
It feels like you got released from chains, right?

228
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,826
Yes, it feels nice.

229
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,448
You did really well for the last month.

230
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,809
You must be careful for a while.

231
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,528
No extreme exercises.

232
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:39,013
Of course. I almost died.

233
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:43,919
I really enjoyed using priority seating during your treatment.

234
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,331
Can't we sit at the priority seating anymore?

235
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,545
So, how do you feel?

236
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,859
I think I feel fine.

237
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,630
I don't believe in God,

238
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,117
but you should be very grateful if there is one.

239
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:10,788
It would've been very dangerous if the injury was any lower.

240
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,148
Thank you.

241
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,368
- See you in physical therapy.
- Okay.

242
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:20,611
Doctor. Can you give me one portable cast?

243
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:24,627
Please come alone next time if you can.

244
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,095
Okay.

245
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:28,214
- She's stingy.
- Please, come on.

246
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,874
What?

247
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,518
So how does it feel to be free?

248
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,985
It's good.

249
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:43,554
What a bummer.

250
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,614
Why?

251
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:48,860
My new role as the "caring friend" at the ICU worked really well with girls.

252
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
Seriously.

253
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,814
Where do you want to go first since you got out of the hospital?

254
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,618
I want to go see our boss.

255
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:00,355
There was so much work while you were gone.

256
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,143
That old lady.

257
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,819
Hey, she's not an old lady.

258
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,304
She's not even married.

259
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:11,314
You are wrong to think that being an old lady is bad.

260
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:13,502
But you just used it with a bad meaning.

261
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,820
You could have just called her "boss."

262
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,898
Stop being so persistent over nothing.

263
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:21,636
Anyway, I filled in your shift for you, so buy me a watch.

264
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:24,588
Why? You made money for the work you did.

265
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:27,648
Come on! Buy one for me.

266
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:29,484
Are you okay?

267
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,812
Just kidding.

268
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,407
I will kill you.

269
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,042
How can you say that to someone who almost died?

270
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,736
You shouldn't say something like that.

271
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,312
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,373
It's so strange. I can never beat him.

273
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:48,803
Hey, wait up!

274
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,550
Hello.

275
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,002
Oh, hi.

276
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,286
Boss.

277
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,254
What?

278
00:19:57,254 --> 00:19:58,797
I have a gift for you.

279
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,689
What is it?

280
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,444
Hello.

281
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,530
Oh, my goodness!

282
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,180
Are you okay now?

283
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,260
Yes.

284
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,487
I was really worried about you.

285
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:17,882
How can you treat him so different from me?

286
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,177
Don't you know who worked hard here while he was away?

287
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,378
Are you hungry?

288
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,739
- Have a seat. I'm sure you still need to recover.
- Yes, I'm hungry.

289
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,223
All right.

290
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,534
It's so good to see you again!

291
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,847
- Eat more, okay?
- Yes, thank you.

292
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,450
What are you doing? Keep cooking the meat.

293
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,213
- Eat more, okay?
- Okay.

294
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,490
- Boss.
- Yes?

295
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,232
You're obsessed with people's looks, right?

296
00:20:43,232 --> 00:20:44,451
What do you mean?

297
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,719
You favor handsome boys.

298
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:51,142
Why would you say something obvious?

299
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:55,361
Hey, Joon Pyo. Life is easier for pretty boys.

300
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:58,706
I missed you so much, Boss.

301
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:01,592
What's up with you? You weren't like this before.

302
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:04,828
What's up with him? Did you get hurt a lot?

303
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,073
- Come on, eat more.
- Okay.

304
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,318
Keep the meat coming.

305
00:21:10,318 --> 00:21:12,638
I'm cooking.

306
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,391
As always, your kimchi stew is the best.

307
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:20,544
I missed this more than my mom's cooking while at the hospital.

308
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:24,555
Why didn't you tell me about that? I would have brought it to the hospital.

309
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:27,085
The hospital said no outside food!

310
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,270
Nothing's impossible in life.

311
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,414
Right? Come on, eat more.

312
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,207
Okay.

313
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:35,744
Good, good.

314
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,545
Here's your stuff.

315
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:42,241
I see you didn't bring any girls into this room.

316
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,376
You've changed.

317
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:45,962
How come?

318
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,139
Now you know how to be sarcastic.

319
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,199
What do you mean?

320
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:56,236
It's hard to explain, but it means you know how to mock people.

321
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:59,166
I guess you learned a new word in your class.

322
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,098
Hey, Joon Pyo.

323
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,459
Thank you.

324
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,561
For what?

325
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:13,771
You know what I mean.

326
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:16,767
I don't know if you don't tell me.

327
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,295
Thank you for taking care of me at the hospital,

328
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,940
thank you for helping me commute for my treatment,

329
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,060
thank you for filling in my shift,

330
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,894
and thank you for preparing school paper works so that I don't have to take the semester off.

331
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:32,049
Glad you know.

332
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:38,256
I was worried sick because of you.

333
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,366
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:42,819
You are my first guy friend after graduating from an all-girls school.

335
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,687
Don't ever do that again.

336
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:49,849
I promise I won't die before I graduate. I promise you.

337
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:52,806
You told me not to mention death to you before.

338
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:57,450
Hey, you can't, but I can.

339
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,578
Because I'm the one who actually almost died.

340
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,571
That's hypocritical.

341
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:06,450
So, I heard you went on a trip with Jae Won.

342
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,677
Yes.

343
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,904
Was it nice?

344
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:19,830
Did you see Jae Won after the accident?

345
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,701
No.

346
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,983
He was at the hospital the whole time until your consciousness came back.

347
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:33,436
It looked like he wanted to die in your place.

348
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,955
He was suffering a lot, beating himself up.

349
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,421
Did you hear the news about Jae Won?

350
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,448
What news?

351
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:53,696
He punched Tae Hyung in class in front of the professor and everyone else.

352
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:57,518
I heard he might get referred to the Disciplinary Board.

353
00:23:57,518 --> 00:24:00,420
What happens, then?

354
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,666
In the worst-case scenario, he can get a suspension from school.

355
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,810
If he gets suspended during senior year,

356
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,613
he won't be able to find a job.

357
00:24:10,613 --> 00:24:12,450
What about Tae Hyung?

358
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,694
The victim's statement is the most important.

359
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:19,373
But Tae Hyung doesn't want to forgive Jae Won.

360
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:22,593
Is there nothing we can do?

361
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:26,631
I heard there would be two witnesses,

362
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:31,343
one from the club and another from his major, to talk about his usual behavior.

363
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:34,998
Eun Ji will go as the witness of the scene, the one from his major,

364
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:38,676
and Yoon Won will be the one from the club.

365
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:43,247
I feel bad for your best friend.

366
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:45,232
Let me use the restroom.

367
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,063
Haven't you talked to Jae Won at all?

368
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,051
I called him many times when I woke up in the hospital.

369
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:59,791
But he's avoiding my calls.

370
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:05,394
But still, I heard he checked in on you through Yoon Won the whole time.

371
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:08,114
Ae Ri.

372
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,858
For me,

373
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,262
the last memory before I woke up at the hospital

374
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:18,640
was the happiest memory of my life.

375
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,726
It's very ironic.

376
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,462
Was it that good?

377
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,189
Yes.

378
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,117
Be careful, though.

379
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:30,829
People were gossiping about you two, thinking it's strange.

380
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:35,040
People wanted to know why you two went on a trip together in the first place.

381
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,719
In our club, business school, and art school, everybody was talking about it.

382
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,990
Let's go eat.

383
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,875
Okay, let's go.

384
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:58,622
Ji Hyun. Let's go drink cocktails.

385
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:02,300
The doctor told me not to drink for a month.

386
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,896
Doctors always say that. Listen to just half of what they said.

387
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:09,167
Then, shall we?

388
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,994
I felt stuck for a while.

389
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,513
But why cocktails?

390
00:26:13,513 --> 00:26:20,342
I heard some people from my major talk about vodka, gin, rum, and what was it, tequila?

391
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:22,655
But I had no idea about them, so it was frustrating.

392
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:25,157
Maybe that's what Seoul kids drink.

393
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:28,435
I don't like it. Let's just drink soju.

394
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,664
Come on, let's go.

395
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,230
Sure, let's go.

396
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,535
- Are you coming with me?
- Yes.

397
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,703
Let's go.

398
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,387
But that hurt. I'll kill you.

399
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,964
Sorry.

400
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,854
- Hello.
- Welcome.

401
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,414
Hello.

402
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:00,434
Let's sit here.

403
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,720
Wow, this is no joke.

404
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:06,741
Look at that.

405
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,959
So, what do you want?

406
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,521
V-Vodka, please.

407
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:14,981
Vodka? Vodka and what?

408
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:19,010
Do you want it with soda, coke, or just a shot?

409
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,854
Or do you want it on the rocks?

410
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,161
Which one? Quickly.

411
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,464
One vodka tonic,

412
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:34,452
one Gin and tonic, and two Agwa Bombs, please.

413
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,053
Okay.

414
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,506
Wait, have you had cocktails before?

415
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:42,133
No, I don't want to look like a country boy, so I did some research.

416
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:44,772
I don't know what they are.

417
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:49,041
I don't know how we went to the same school when you were this smart.

418
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,904
It looks like a dungeon, right?

419
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,738
Yes, totally.

420
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:57,616
I can't wait to try it.

421
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,340
You guys are freshmen, right?

422
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,869
Yes.

423
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:12,431
I've been here for so long. It's obvious to me.

424
00:28:12,431 --> 00:28:15,767
So have you tried an Agwa Bomb before?

425
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,206
No.

426
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:21,490
Look at this glass.

427
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,867
Look at the shape of this glass.

428
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,104
It has alcohol extracted from coca leaves

429
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,723
and an energy drink separately, like water and oil.

430
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:33,152
Those two can be mixed together,

431
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,271
but this glass splits them up.

432
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:38,390
Go ahead, bottoms up.

433
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,968
- Try it.
- You try it first.

434
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:57,635
When the two separated by the glass meet together in your mouth,

435
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:01,547
they explode like fantastic fireworks.

436
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,937
But be careful.

437
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:13,414
You have to meet exactly in this center.

438
00:29:13,414 --> 00:29:15,302
Balance is very important.

439
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:19,766
When one side is tilting, the other side supports it.

440
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:24,626
And when the other side is tilting, it's vice versa.

441
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:28,022
- One more round?
- Yes.

442
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,470
Take a look at this.

443
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,909
It doesn't get mixed.

444
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,785
It's really cool.

445
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,745
I'll have another glass, too.

446
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,750
<i>[I miss you.]
[Why don't you answer?]
[It's going to rain today, so don't forget an umbrella.]
[How was your day?]</i>

447
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,206
<i>[Jae Won.]</i>

448
00:30:50,206 --> 00:31:02,050
<i>[I miss you.]
[Why don't you answer?]
[It's going to rain today, so don't forget an umbrella.]
[How was your day?]
[Jae Won.]</i>

449
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,294
<i>[Ji Hyun: Jae Won.]</i>
