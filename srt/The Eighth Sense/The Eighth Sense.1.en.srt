Just tell me what your worries are!

11
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,182
Come again.

12
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,863
- What are you doing? Clean this up faster!
- Yes.

13
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:11,823
Be careful not to break anything.

14
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,718
We should kill that jerk!

15
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:17,622
Isn't it crazy? He was all over her, and now he dumps her?

16
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:21,442
That's not it. She's always drunk like this.

17
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:24,220
How could I have messed up all the job interviews?

18
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,808
At least you made it to the finals in one. I got rejected by all from the resume stage.

19
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,035
You've done an internship, at least.

20
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,963
Forget about it. Just do cheers.

21
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,816
There are so many other men in the world.

22
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,867
One more soju, please!

00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,125
We were drinking Jinro, not Chamisul.

24
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,727
I'm sorry. I'll bring it right over.

25
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,855
Do you know what her goal is?

26
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,290
She's not listening.

27
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,691
It's dating five guys.

28
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,567
- Dating five guys?
- Yes.

29
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,929
- What on earth is that? Here's your soju.
- And listen.

30
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,314
She wants to date one Korean, one French...

31
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:04,860
What are you doing? Move faster! Go and clean that up!

32
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,282
Nice, nice.

33
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,742
- You should stop drinking.
- Say a few words.

34
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,437
Congrats to Jae Won for being discharged from the military!

00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,798
<i>Congrats!</i>

36
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,800
Bottoms up, man!

37
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,654
Have you adjusted to society yet?

38
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,481
What's there to adjust?

39
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,566
How can you not take time off from university?

40
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:40,571
How can you keep up with the university and everything else? Take it easy, man.

41
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,365
I need to finish university soon and get a job.

42
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,976
You know what? When I see you, I feel like I'm suffocating.

43
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:49,622
Besides the club activity, all you do is study.

44
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,076
You interned at that foreign company and then went to the military, so I thought you'd take a break.

45
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:57,880
But instead, you got the certifications and scored 950 in TOEIC.

46
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,908
You got my respect, man.

47
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:07,103
Hey! We can't afford to worry about this jerk.

48
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:11,961
This guy is well backed up by family, connections, and all.

49
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,232
He doesn't need us to worry about him.

50
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:24,040
Who around us got their parents to buy them a car? Just him.

51
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,239
Also, a flock of girls in our school awaits him to return from the military.

52
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,465
A flock of girls.

53
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,875
It's enough.

54
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,337
Did I lie?

55
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,364
Stop nagging.

56
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,753
- Are you crazy?
- What, are you going to hit me? Come at me!

57
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:48,248
Let me get the hospital money from your parents.

58
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,899
They're fighting. Go do something.

59
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,970
Hey, what are you two doing?

60
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,330
I only spoke the truth. Let go of this. You let go of me first!

61
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,980
Stop it now.

62
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:01,040
Hey, enough.

63
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,130
He almost killed us!

64
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,759
Jae Won, you know I love you, right?

65
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,650
When I drink this, you forgive me, okay?

66
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,420
Stop drinking now.

67
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,955
You know I love you more, right?

68
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:22,848
What the...

69
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,741
Excuse me, can you give me a cigarette?

70
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,019
I only vape.
<i>(T/N: Vape is an electronic cigarette)</i>

71
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,864
Then where's the nearest convenience store?

72
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,311
I'll give you one of my boss' cigarettes.

73
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:05,883
Thank you!

74
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:29,331
Why did you bring two?

75
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:31,884
It's not nice to bring just one.

76
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:59,427
I meant to apologize before, for the fight. Sorry about that.

77
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,793
Congrats on the discharge from the army.

78
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:10,856
Did you hear that? I guess we were too loud.

79
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,175
All university areas' bars are like that.

80
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:19,239
Then do you go to university here?

81
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,084
What year?

82
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,471
I just got in last week.

83
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,890
So you're a freshman, huh?

84
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,044
- Why do you ask?
- Because my younger brother also...

85
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,232
Nevermind.

86
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:43,330
Hey, freshman! What do you know about things?

87
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,825
What do you know better when you just came back from the military?

88
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,511
Say what? You have to respect your senior.

89
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:53,757
Just a few weeks back, you were going to high school in your uniforms.

90
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:05,518
If you work this late, how do you get home?

91
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,872
I come from the countryside, so I live in a school dorm.

92
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:16,614
If you just moved from the countryside, then you won't know many people, do you?

93
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,303
Do you want me to be your friend?

94
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,785
- Hey, Jae Won!
- Yes!

95
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,130
This bastard is totally wasted.

96
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,230
Are you okay? Seriously!

97
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,475
Let's go.

98
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,693
I paid the bill with your mom's card.

99
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:40,053
I'm going.

100
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,198
We've got plenty of lighters at the bar.

101
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,686
Let's go.

102
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,490
I said, let's go!

103
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,434
We're leaving now. Bye!

104
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,102
What are you doing?

105
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,137
We need to close things up.

106
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,689
Leave it. We can do it tomorrow.

107
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,175
Bring a bottle of soju over here.

108
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,770
Hurry up!

109
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,967
Why are you so slow?

110
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,763
Cheers.

111
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,006
Someone taught you good drinking manners.

112
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,199
You must be tired.

113
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,095
By the way...

114
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,098
Promise me one thing.

115
00:10:58,098 --> 00:10:59,658
What is it?

116
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:04,410
When you drink with other adults, do what you just did.

117
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,650
But don't turn your head when you're drinking with me.

118
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,861
I can't do that.

119
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:18,980
After my divorce, I came to Seoul with nothing in my pocket.

120
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,830
But now that I made it this far, I realized something.

121
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:32,349
I realized that I don't have a single friend to sit down and drink with in Seoul.

122
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:39,606
So I came up with this one rule. When I drink with my staff, we face each other.

123
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,154
I'm quite obedient.

124
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:57,049
Hey! You have to use two hands when you're pouring!

125
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,251
I'm sorry.

126
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,298
Let me pour it for you.

127
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:07,943
There you go.

128
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:12,823
Did you get settled in Seoul already?

129
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,484
Yes, thanks to you.

130
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,047
But why did you start working right away after coming here?

131
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:26,670
Other kids from the countryside were hanging out at those places that came out on TV.

132
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:30,932
I'm not sure what's what yet.

133
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:34,403
Let's just say it's my own way of settling here.

134
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,180
There's nothing to be afraid of.

135
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,160
At first, you'll be clumsy and scared of everything.

136
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,678
But that's because you aren't familiar with it.

137
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:50,251
You don't know about Seoul, the university, and about being a grown-up.

138
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,155
But time will make things better.

139
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:57,350
If you live every day to the fullest, one day, you'll feel like,

140
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,140
"Why was I so worried back then?"

141
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,558
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

142
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:06,685
I'll live every day to my fullest.

143
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,911
There you go. Live to the fullest.

144
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,142
- I'm cold.
- Cold?

145
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:15,853
- Yes.
- Sure. I'm cold, too.

146
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:18,004
Were you cold?

147
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,800
- We're here.
- Yes, we're here. Get in there.

148
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,137
Are you okay?

149
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:29,900
- Are you okay?
- Jae Won.

150
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,500
- Jae Won.
- Yes?

151
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,156
I'm so jealous of you.

152
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:39,392
You don't have any worries whatsoever, do you?

153
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:43,054
For you, it's all served on a silver platter.

154
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:46,049
Your dad owns a company.

155
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,790
I'm jealous of the worry-free you!

156
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,130
Okay, stop it now.

157
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,114
It's okay. You can do it well, too.

158
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,749
- Get inside now.
- Thanks.

159
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:56,243
- And drink moderately.
- Thanks.

160
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,744
Don't drink this much. Oh, no!

161
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,222
You freaked me out.

162
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,623
It's all good.

163
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:04,275
Please get inside safely.

164
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,013
Where have you been in Seoul?

165
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,932
I went to the Gangnam station area once.

166
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:15,311
I thought the entire population of this country was there.

167
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,789
I freaked out and ran back immediately.

168
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,969
How come buses in Seoul keep coming and coming?

169
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,011
Have you ever gone on subway line 2?

170
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,772
No.

171
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:41,121
You see, the line 2 subway goes in a circle, so you have to see the directions before getting on.

172
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:45,383
Guess what? I still struggle getting on the right one.

173
00:14:48,245 --> 00:14:50,190
You have to go to Han River for sure.

174
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:56,553
When you see the Han River, it makes you really feel that you're in Seoul city.

175
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:58,781
Go there tomorrow.

176
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,249

00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:13,553
He'll eventually see her at the surf club.

349
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,801
It's your day off, what are you doing here?

350
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:22,654
It was the first day of university, and it would be a shame if I just went back to the dorm.

351
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:25,458
Is there nowhere else for you to go?

352
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,610
I went to Han River.

353
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,480
How was it?

354
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,232
It was nice.

355
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:36,393
When that table leaves, let's have a drink.

356
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:38,012
Okay.

357
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:03,379
Hey, don't work and just wait. Why aren't they leaving?

358
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,161
Let's have another glass! Jae Won, you should have a drink, too.

359
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:14,022
Come on, cheers!

360
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:19,979
You're really cool, Jae Won. He's the man.

361
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,852
It tastes bitter now.

362
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:32,624
Eun Ji, I heard you took time off, but are you back this semester?

363
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,494
Yes.

364
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:39,340
You canceled your time off because Jae Won is back to school, right?

365
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:44,220
I'm going out for a cigarette.

366
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,211
Have another glass.

367
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:57,117
You're awesome!

368
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,681
Hello.

369
00:33:20,774 --> 00:33:23,951
Oh, hi.

370
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:31,143
I didn't see you earlier.

371
00:33:34,187 --> 00:33:36,548
It's my day off.

372
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:40,660
Then why are you here?

373
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,446
I came to have a drink with my boss.

374
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,059
I see.

375
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:51,312
You do have friends.

376
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,460
My name is Ji Hyun.

377
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:15,086
I thought we should know each other's name if we're going to be friends.

378
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,251
Right, my name's Jae Won.

379
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,830
Don't drink too much, and get home safe.

380
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,081
Hello.

381
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:54,150
Oh, hello.

382
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,704
I'm Kim Ji Hyun, the one who called you earlier.

383
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:03,260
Oh, you're the freshman! Welcome!

384
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Come and have a seat here.

385
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,518
Have you surfed before?

386
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:13,912
No, never.

387
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,950
It's okay.

388
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:20,450
I must say, you're so cute!

389
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,336
Thank you.

390
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:27,516
Let's see... I told them not to touch the stuff on the desk.

391
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:30,194
- I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.
- Yeah, no kidding.

392
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,821
I had some stuff to do.

393
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:40,158
Hey. You also decided to join the club after seeing how pretty she is on the poster, right?

394
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:42,140
Guys all join because of her.

395
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,067
No, it's not like that.

396
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:48,169
I'm just joking. Say hi to each other. He's a freshman.

397
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:50,130
Hello.

398
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:52,432
Hi.

399
00:35:52,432 --> 00:35:57,854
Just sign here on the form. I've got your number, so just write your name here.

400
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,396
Welcome, cutie pie.

401
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,239
Thank you. I'm excited to join the club.

402
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,226
Here's the info for our first get-together trip, so take one.

403
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:13,000
No refunds.

404
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,430
Okay.

405
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,090
Have a nice day.

406
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,830
See you!

407
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:20,177
Oh my, he's so cute.

408
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,257
Hey, what's up with those big boxers? Don't you have boxer briefs?

409
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:26,475
This is all I have.

410
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,885
Take mine, then.

411
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,828
No! What kind of nonsense is that?

412
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,400
Are you really serious about this surf club?

413
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,102
That's so not you.

414
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:40,188
- What is the deal?
- What?

415
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:41,799
You're acting weird!

416
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,652
Like, you don't need money but started working as soon as we came to Seoul.

417
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:46,378
You even missed the orientation day.

418
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,389
You ignore me when I say let's go out to hang out.

419
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,616
But then you join a surf club?

420
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,277
- Hey, Joon Pyo.
- Yes?

421
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,105
How long has it been since we've become adults?

422
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:58,116
Three months?

423
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:02,386
When you make a decision, do you do it because you have a clear purpose or reason?

424
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,804
No.

425
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:08,068
Then isn't it okay to try something new without any reason?

426
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,410
Sure.

427
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,058
What's this?

428
00:37:16,058 --> 00:37:21,221
It's sunscreen. If you don't put anything on your face, you'll get sunburned.

429
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,282
You don't wear this either.

430
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,060
Since we are hillbillies, at least you got to do it right.

431
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,670
If you apply some, you'll look like you know something.

432
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,181
Thanks, man.

433
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:37,095
Hey, pack some towels, too.

434
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,913
Hey, cutie pie.

435
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,616
Come on, let me introduce you to the group. Attention, please!

436
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,344
Here's our new member. Freshman, Ji Hyun.

437
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:54,287
- Hello!
- Hi!

438
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,736
Let's see. Who's not here yet?

439
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,721
You're the VP, and you show up only now?

440
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:05,791
Sorry, really sorry.

441
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,551
Hello, Sunbaenim!

442
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,136
Hey, Jae Won!

443
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:13,298
Jae Won! Come sit here.

444
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,132
All right! Let's hit the road.

445
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:25,293
Surf club, Free Bird! It's the first trip of this semester. Let's go!

446
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:28,161
<i>Let's go!</i>

447
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:56,150
We'll be looking at the same landscape, so it would be nice to listen to the same music.

448
