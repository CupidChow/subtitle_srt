Have you ever been to the Han River before?

11
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,296
Yes.

12
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,760
Don't you need to answer your phone?

13
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,496
It's okay.

14
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:19,805
By the way, thank you for the drawing.

15
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,725
You are such a good artist.

16
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:28,430
- Can I see them?
- What?

17
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,924
Wait, Hyung.

18
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,759
Why?

19
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,204
Wow, you draw so well.

20
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,638
You drew this right here.

21
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:08,528
Why did you come to the Han River Park here and not the one near school?

22
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,440
I just love it here.

23
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,742
Is that so?

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,047
Do you want to try to draw?

25
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:26,637
Since you taught me how to surf, I will teach you how to draw.

26
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,774
The basics of drawing are

27
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:39,410
lines,

28
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,350
color,

29
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,797
and dimensions.

30
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:54,216
All right. Then I'll try to draw the night scene here right now,

31
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,794
so why don't you go get some coffee from the convenience store for us?

32
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,254
Okay.

33
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,272
Thank you. I'm almost done.

34
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:40,879
- What is this?
- Didn't I do it well?

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,291
I think I did it decently.

36
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,551
Sign here. It's still your first artwork.

37
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,423
It's not an artwork but a piece of trash.

38
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,049
You can throw it away.

39
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,711
Thank you for the coffee.

40
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,739
It's been a while-

41
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,708
Trying something new.

42
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,786
But I don't think drawing is the right path for you.

43
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:15,172
Of course, I know that.

44
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,689
Actually, I had a dream of my own.

45
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,442
What is it?

46
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,254
It's nothing.

47
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,406
Come on, tell me.

48
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,134
Nevermind.

49
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,807
Hyung.

50
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,118
Do you want to eat ramen with me?

51
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:50,466
Do you even know what you're suggesting?

52
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,351
Sorry?

53
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:56,521
I just saw people eating ramen at the convenience store, so...

54
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,633
I see, okay.

55
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,527
Let's go eat soon.

56
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,020
Okay.

57
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,798
Have you ever eaten ramen by the Han River?

58
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,117
No, this is my first time.

59
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:19,245
Ramen eating here tastes different.

60
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,296
It's so delicious.

61
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,917
I didn't know it was this late.

62
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,735
The last train already left, right?

63
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,213
Yes, I think so.

64
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,465
I'll get you a taxi.

65
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:41,892
No, it's okay. I can take the late-night bus.

66
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,428
No, take a taxi.

67
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,268
It's on the way.

68
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,069
Did you call a taxi?

69
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,815
Aren't you getting on?

70
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,599
Hello.

71
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,680
Get home safely.

72
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,698
You, too.

73
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,864
Isn't that too much food?

74
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:28,965
This isn't much.

75
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:42,287
What time did you come back? I went to bed around 1 AM.

76
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,192
Did you go to the "MT" with Ae Ri?

77
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,203
What's "MT"?

78
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,789
Do you still don't know what that is?

79
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,882
It's a word for the Love Motel.

80
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,676
You're crazy.

81
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:58,703
You did go there, didn't you?

82
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,052
- Hi, Ae Ri.
- Hi.

83
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,232
Did you have a good time with Ji Hyun yesterday?

84
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:23,087
Yes. It was fun.

85
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:24,896
Right?

86
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:28,567
Ji Hyun might not look like it, but he's a good guy.

87
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,969
What did you guys do?

88
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,504
He won't tell me.

89
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:35,124
Nothing much.

90
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:38,418
We had dinner,

91
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:42,055
a glass of wine,

92
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,858
and went for a walk.

93
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,795
That's all you guys did until morning?

94
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,474
Okay, fine.

95
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:54,409
Eat more.

96
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,086
Thank you.

97
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,143
I'm sorry, Ae Ri.

98
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:27,126
My battery died.

99
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,102
Forget about it. I heard you came back in the morning.

100
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:32,030
It's ridiculous.

101
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,284
I can't believe you stood me up like that.

102
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,261
Do you think I'm a pushover?

103
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:40,847
I'm asking you. Tell me.

104
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,449
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:52,016
I'm joking. Don't be scared.

106
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,165
You...

107
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:02,035
You were with Jae Won Sunbae, right?

108
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,988
Yes.

109
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,383
How did you know?

110
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,395
If it's not Joon Pyo,

111
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:14,714
who would you be out with until that late? You have no other friends.

112
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:18,226
But why did you think I was with Jae Won Sunbae?

113
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,879
Kim Ji Hyun.

114
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,164
If you want to survive in Seoul, you need to grow some wits.

115
00:11:24,164 --> 00:11:29,204
It was obvious when we were on the surf trip.

116
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:37,689
I ran into Jae Won Sunbae yesterday, and he didn't look okay.

117
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,191
It's fine. You don't have to explain in detail.

118
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,010
You don't have to explain it to me.

119
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,334
By the way...

120
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,063
Did you really think I was into you?

121
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:02,529
I just wanted to be your friend, I swear.

122
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,565
Don't go too far, seriously.

123
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:10,654
I went to an all-boys school. I'm not used to having girls approach me.

124
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:12,740
I didn't know what to do.

125
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,010
That makes sense. That can happen.

126
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,479
Especially if it's someone pretty like me approaches you,

127
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,606
then it can rattle your heart, right?

128
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:24,225
Don't take it too far.

129
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,569
I mean it.

130
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,657
I didn't take it too far at all!

131
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:33,351
Isn't it obvious? Look. Can't you see it?

132
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:35,300
What are you doing?

133
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:37,998
- Hey, TA.
- Yes?

134
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:39,366
Did you take attendance?

135
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,242
Yes, Professor.

136
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,731
I have a schedule outside of school.

137
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:50,060
Please divide the class into groups of two to do a team project.

138
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,620
Okay.

139
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:53,605
That's all for today.

140
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,883
If you have any questions, ask the TA.

141
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:57,792
Okay.

142
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,737
Bye, Sir.

143
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,117
Wow, that was half-hearted.

144
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:08,937
That's all we get from our tuition fee?

145
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:10,322
Hey, Jae Won.

146
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,326
Please be my partner for the team project.

147
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,169
No way. I called dibs on Jae Won.

148
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,114
You have already had your chances several times before.

149
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:20,959
- No way, no way.
- Quiet, guys.

150
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,320
Don't worry. I'll make the groups.

151
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,782
Hey, isn't it obvious? It's mostly seniors here.

152
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:30,142
Only a few will actually work, and others will be free riders.

153
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,860
Just let us work together.

154
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,546
Because we are seniors, I can't let that happen.

155
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:35,656
So that's absolutely no.

156
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:39,009
The professor already knows who's close to whom.

157
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,487
We will be told off if we're always in the same group.

158
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,715
You're trying to be in Jae Won's group, aren't you?

159
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:50,526
No. We are going to draw straws fairly.

160
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:52,030
What's wrong with him?

161
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,557
I'm doing this for you.

162
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,235
I just came back from the army. My sense is not on point.

163
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,420
You always do well.

164
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,548
That's not the problem here.

165
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,799
The professor loves you.

166
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,334
An "A+" is locked in for you.

167
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:08,738
I'm going to announce the groups.

168
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,601
Song Geun Soo.

169
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,611
And Moon Chae Won.

170
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:16,913
Seo Young Hwan.

171
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,666
Kim Jin Cheol.

172
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,345
Park Won Seok.

173
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:26,464
Kang Myeong Jae.

174
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,868
Too bad. I'm doomed.

175
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,738
Seo Jae Won.

176
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,410
<i>[Kang Soo Jung]</i>

177
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,779
Koh Eun Ji.

178
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,908
Lucky her.

179
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,129
That's it. No objection allowed.

180
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,341
It's a tight schedule. Make sure to start working today. Dismissed!

181
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,826
Dismissed.

182
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,744
I'm counting on you.

183
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,797
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

184
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,107
Let me use the restroom.

185
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:19,074
- Hey.
- Yes?

186
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,078
What's wrong with you?

187
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:22,862
What about it?

188
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:26,916
You intentionally put Eun Ji and me in the same group.

189
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,545
No, I didn't. What are you talking about it?

190
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:33,097
I did it in front of you guys, to be fair.

191
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,791
I know you so well.

192
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,037
Why are you doing this?

193
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:41,430
Jae Won, I really didn't do it.

194
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,378
It's driving me crazy.

195
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:59,407
What else can we do?

196
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,519
I didn't want this either.

197
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,498
Did you scheme this with Tae Hyung?

198
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,935
What are you talking about?

199
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,154
That's nonsense.

200
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:25,165
Shall we go for lunch?

201
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,743
Let's just focus on the work.

202
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:42,408
I won't bring up our history anymore.

203
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:46,003
I also want to focus on the assignment. Let's do this right.

204
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,259
Let's just work separately.

205
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,046
I will do the research and send them to you.

206
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:58,240
Why don't you make the slide show with that?

207
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,260
Why would you do all the research by yourself?

208
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,564
Let's just work together for now

209
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:07,908
and combine and compromise our opinions later.

210
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,508
What's wrong?

211
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:52,545
What? It's nothing.

212
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,320
I need to use the restroom.

213
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,928
Ji Hyun.

214
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,347
Hyung.

215
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,860
What were you doing?

216
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,820
Joon Pyo had some work to do. So I was reading a book.

217
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,926
Wow, Joon Pyo. I have misjudged him.

218
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,255
I guess he's studying harder than I thought he would.

219
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:01,223
He's doing that after drinking all night yesterday and coming back this morning.

220
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,900
It's okay to do that when you're a freshman.

221
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,935
But you still do that in your senior year.

222
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,847
I don't drink these days.

223
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:12,400
You shouldn't judge people by their first impressions.

224
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,311
I do judge people by their first impressions.

225
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,760
Then how was my first impression?

226
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,921
A guy who fought drunk...

227
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,292
But a cool guy.

228
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,906
How was my first impression?

229
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,067
Your first impression?

230
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:43,798
You were an intimidated country mouse who had just moved to Seoul.

231
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,150
Come on.

232
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,844
I'm joking.

233
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:51,180
I told you that I don't judge people based on their first impressions.

234
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,433
In the children's book story, the country mouse couldn't adjust to the city and went back home,

235
00:19:55,433 --> 00:20:00,238
but you got used to your new life just fine this quick, right?

236
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:02,517
Stop comparing me to a mouse, Hyung.

237
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:05,195
Then my first impression of you was of a city mouse.

238
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:06,796
I'll define it with that one word.

239
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:09,223
It's just a metaphor.

240
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:13,227
I don't even remember that story.

241
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,146
By the way...

242
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,316
What was the relationship between the two?

243
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,935
We dated.

244
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,779
Did the two mice have a long-distance relationship?

245
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:30,019
You're such an artist. You're going too deep with it.

246
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,547
The two were...

247
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,308
just very good friends.

248
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,211
That's a shame.

249
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,409
By the way, why do you carry my sketch around?

250
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,576
A piece of poop can be art if you're famous.

251
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,919
Who knows? Maybe you will become famous.

252
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:58,356
It's the first work of artist Seo Jae Won.

253
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:01,868
Throw it away.

254
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,319
No.

255
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,312
Throw it away.

256
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,238
No.

257
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,766
- Come on! Just throw it away.
- I won't!

258
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,192
- Throw it away.
- No.

259
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:13,071
I think I'll die if you punch me.

260
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,165
Stop teasing me!

261
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,730
Hello.

262
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,398
Yes, hi.

263
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,277
Did the orders arrive?

264
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:29,671
It all arrived, and I had already organized them.

265
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:30,931
I'll clean the floor first.

266
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,573
Okay.

267
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,885
What's up with you?

268
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:46,262
What do you mean?

269
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:47,864
Did something good happen?

270
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,741
No, it's the same as usual.

271
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,920
Are you dating someone?

272
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,206
No, I'm not dating.

273
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,427
I worked with so many part-timers. I know when I see one.

274
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:02,703
I know when I see one.

275
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:08,507
You look like a man in love working happily.

276
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,678
Seriously, I'm not.

277
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:13,605
You can't fool me.

278
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:19,611
Not knowing where to start

279
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:24,399
means there are many factors that make you feel depressed.

280
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:27,236
What do you feel the most?

281
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,390
A pressure.

282
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,758
What kind of pressure?

283
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:37,288
Honestly, I had no worries when I was in the army.

284
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:40,090
Maybe I was avoiding reality.

285
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,844
But when I came back to school as a senior, everything just hit me.

286
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:49,258
Just like I had to leave the protection of being in the army,

287
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:53,045
soon, I'll need to leave the protection of being in school.

288
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,549
Are you worried about getting a job?

289
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:59,077
Right, but the real problem is I don't know if I even want to get a job.

290
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,145
If not, then what?

291
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,366
There's something I really want to learn.

292
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,334
But I don't have the courage.

293
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,861
It also feels like it's too late.

294
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,332
My father wants me to work in a conglomerate for a few years to build experience

295
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:15,209
and then inherit his company.

296
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:20,306
I'm not here to counsel your career.

297
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,827
This is not a doctor's note,

298
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:27,446
but let me give you advice as someone who's older than you.

299
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:32,910
Hey, you're still freaking young.

300
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,963
You're not too late to start a new thing.

301
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:39,800
But it feels like a pipe dream in my situation.

302
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,361
Your question is,

303
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:46,532
if you choose to walk down that path, can you bear the consequences, right?

304
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:48,100
Yes.

305
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,811
That's up to you.

306
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:53,089
Of course, I know that.

307
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:56,500
You should take your time making that decision.

308
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,553
Take your time to think about it.

309
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:04,342
What else is pressuring you?

310
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:08,420
I want to free myself from human relationships.

311
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:14,533
I'm getting sick of myself wearing a mask when I'm dealing with others.

312
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:16,454
Jae Won.

313
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,783
You don't have to be loved by everyone.

314
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,395
Can I point out a sensitive matter?

315
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,457
Sure, go ahead.

316
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:34,598
- Take their order.
- Okay.

317
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,283
Welcome.

318
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,354
Hello, Sunbaenim.

319
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,283
So, this is where you work.

320
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,409
Yes.

321
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:49,912
How have you been?

322
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:52,698
The pork belly has too much fat.

323
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:55,159
Is there any skirt steak or pork neck?

324
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,179
We only have the ones on the menu.

325
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,940
Frozen pork belly is very good here.

326
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,075
Why don't you try it?

327
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:04,936
We'll have three servings of them, then.

328
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,637
Okay.

329
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,136
Give us more small plates.

330
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:23,203
Okay.

331
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,401
Coming.

332
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:31,156
Yes?

333
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:35,433
This spatters oil too much and smokes.

334
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,413
Can you grill it for us?

335
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:43,040
Well... you're supposed to cook it yourself.

336
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,909
But I'll cook it for you since you're my club senior.

337
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,086
Today I was going to...

338
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,436
Yes?

339
00:25:55,436 --> 00:25:56,413
Bring us some more vegetables.

340
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,656
Oh, okay.

341
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,909
Thank you.

342
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,182
Here you go.

343
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:09,809
Oh, also, refill the side dishes.

344
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:12,711
Okay.

345
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:23,981
- I fell asleep the moment we started.
- Here you go.

346
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:27,343
There are oil splashes on my glass.

347
00:26:27,343 --> 00:26:29,470
Can you get me a new glass?

348
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,422
Okay.

349
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,143
Here you go.

350
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:36,328
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

351
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,662
- Yes?
- Water, please.

352
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,555
Okay.

353
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,353
Hey.

354
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,862
Yes?

355
00:26:46,862 --> 00:26:48,514
I called you.

356
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,024
Didn't you hear me?

357
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:53,485
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

358
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,504
What can I get for you?

359
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,009
Some wet wipes, please.

360
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,387
Okay.

361
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,932
Also, one sprite, please!

362
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:07,342
- Okay.
- It's good here.

363
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:08,968
Why didn't we know about this big place until now?

364
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:10,961
Here you go.

365
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:21,154
Do you know those girls that are making you work over and over again?

366
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:23,973
Yes. She's the club senior.

367
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:27,069
Then what's wrong with them?

368
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:32,249
They are so rude.

369
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,550
Hey, so how's it going with Jae Won?

370
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,113
He asked me to work on the assignment with him.

371
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:48,615
What? Does he want to get back together with you?

372
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:50,351
Will you take him back?

373
00:27:50,351 --> 00:27:53,120
I have to think about it.

374
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,250
Well, I didn't want to do the assignment with him.

375
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,777
But he came back to the surf club as well.

376
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,538
He's totally trying to get back together with you.

377
00:28:02,538 --> 00:28:04,640
I support this decision.

378
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,176
We know each other so well.

379
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:14,132
- Right.
- We work well together on the team project.

380
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:16,193
Enjoy your meal.

381
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,296
Thank you.

382
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,726
- I'll pay for this.
- Okay.

383
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

384
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,777
No.

385
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,789
Good night.

386
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,988
- Thank you for the food.
- Bye.

387
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,458
Excuse me, wait.

388
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,510
What are you doing?

389
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,303
Excuse me?

390
00:29:08,303 --> 00:29:12,700
I was watching you, but I had to say this.

391
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,141
Customers breaking glasses while drinking is not a big deal to us.

392
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:23,244
But if you broke it, isn't it a basic manner to apologize?

393
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:25,780
It's not like I did it on purpose.

394
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,024
Did I say you did it on purpose?

395
00:29:28,024 --> 00:29:30,477
I told you it could happen.

396
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,478
But if you broke it,

397
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:40,408
is it that hard to apologize to the person cleaning it?

398
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,784
Do you want to hear an apology that badly?

399
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,495
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:51,555
Are you happy now?

401
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:54,433
Not to me.

402
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,696
To the boy who's cleaning after you.

403
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,940
I'm okay, Boss.

404
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,143
Get home safe, Sunbaenim.

405
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:06,904
He said he was fine.

406
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,483
Do you want to stop doing business here?

407
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:13,636
Look at this girl.

408
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:16,255
What did you just say?

409
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:19,283
Who treats their customers like this?

410
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:23,452
I'm going to upload your store as a black-list on my school group chat!

411
00:30:23,452 --> 00:30:26,731
Sure, go for it. Go ahead and do so.

412
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:29,168
What kind of rude manner is this?

413
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:32,262
- What did you say, old lady?
- Old lady? How dare you speak like that?

414
00:30:32,262 --> 00:30:34,541
Did your parents teach you like this?

415
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,943
- Sunbaenim, please calm down.
- I can't believe this.

416
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:40,521
I'm holding back for you.

417
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:43,123
What kind of bullshit is that?

418
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:46,869
You better stay out of my sight.

419
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:49,647
Why would you treat someone like her as your senior?

420
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,683
You better stay out of my sight!

421
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,976
Spray some salt on her.

422
00:30:53,976 --> 00:30:56,746
Stay out of my sight!

423
00:30:56,746 --> 00:30:59,598
I'm going to beat you up.

424
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,926
Are you okay?

425
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:04,695
I'm okay.

426
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,206
Do you want to have a drink?

427
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:11,533
No, I'm okay for tonight.

428
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,207
All right. Then why don't you go home early tonight?

429
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,743
I'll finish this and then go.

430
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,615
It's okay. Let me do it. Go home and rest.

431
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,809
Hi.

432
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,737
Jae Won Hyung.

433
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,215
Where are you going?

434
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,959
To the dorm. I'm getting a textbook from a friend.

435
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,240
Shall we go together?

436
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,643
Okay.

437
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,635
Did something happen to you?

438
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,162
No.

439
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:17,034
You look like a country mouse again.

440
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,445
It's just that...

441
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,831
today was a hard day for me.

442
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,300
But now that I see you, I feel better.

443
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,352
To be honest, I saw you working today.

444
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:50,676
I just thought I should be here for you tonight.

445
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:48,109
Do you want to have a beer before you go?

446
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,610
At where? In your room?

447
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,672
Aren't we moving too fast?

448
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:55,949
No, no.

449
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,119
It's nice to have a drink on the rooftop.

450
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,032
Okay, let's go.

451
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,429
It's so pretty up here.

452
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,082
Right?

453
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,719
How long did you date Eun Ji Sunbae?

454
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,316
We were together for about two years.

455
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:35,522
Have you ever dated anyone?

456
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,460
Why would you ask me that?

457
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,421
I guess you haven't dated anyone.

458
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,015
Really, why would you ask me that?

459
00:34:45,674 --> 00:34:48,910
You are still a baby.

460
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,922
Hyung.

461
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,634
Have you ever been there?

462
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,287
The Namsan Tower?

463
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:00,455
Yes, I've been there.

464
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:03,405
But I don't think I've been there since middle school.

465
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:10,865
In TV dramas, couples always go there and put locks up there.

466
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:14,628
It's something I dreamed of doing when I came to Seoul.

467
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,490
Then if you don't meet someone to do that with you,

468
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,134
will you not go there?

469
00:35:20,134 --> 00:35:21,810
No.

470
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,141
I wonder when you can go there.

471
00:35:47,053 --> 00:35:48,879
<i>Kim Ji Hyun!</i>

472
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,358
<i>Did you take the beers?</i>

473
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh, the new best friend! Hello?

474
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,907
Hi.

475
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,660
It's my first time drinking with you.

476
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,240
Right.

477
00:36:12,895 --> 00:36:15,299
- This can is empty.
- Go and bring another one.

478
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,300
- Where is it?
- It'll be somewhere down there.

479
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,051
<i>You bring it. I don't know where it is.</i>
