Hyung, did something happen?

10
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:09,419
We aren't even prepared.

11
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:14,675
It's okay. We can buy stuff there if necessary.

12
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:21,724
Did something bad happen?

13
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,562
Hyung, let's relax.

14
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:03,223
Let's breathe in some fresh morning air.

15
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,841
All I smell are exhaust fumes since we are in the middle of the highway.

16
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,345
It's just an expression. At least, it's not Seoul city air.

17
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:28,370
Don't you need to use the restroom?

18
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,250
I'm okay.

19
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,770
Then I'll be back from the restroom.

20
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,470
Okay.

21
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:49,320
Are you going on a trip?

22
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,470
Yes.

23
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,930
With your girlfriend?

24
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,150
Well, it's...

25
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,245
Here's a mix tape that's perfect for lightening up the mood.

26
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,216
I don't think we have a cassette player in the car.

27
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,604
These days, it comes out as a USB.

28
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:17,931
Hey, boy. This is a gift for you because you're cute.

29
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:22,786
Sorry? No, it's okay. I don't think we would listen to trot songs.

30
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:28,074
I need to spread it among the youth. So, when you become an adult, you'll listen to it.

31
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,136
Think of it as if I'm investing for the future, okay?

32
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:34,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,940
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice day!

34
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:45,326
- Sausages and rice cake!
- Sausages and rice cake!

35
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:55,368
Hello. Can we get two sausages and rice cake, please?

36
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,840
Isn't it funny?

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,670
What is?

38
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,688
In the past, when it came to food at rest stops, it was always udon.

39
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:14,870
But since Lee Young Ja ate it on TV, sausages and rice cakes became the must-eat food at rest stops.

40
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:21,652
We are always living in other's frameworks in this world.

41
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:29,260
So are we eating in a world that Lee Young Ja has created?

42
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,439
Then, I'm going to eat something else.

43
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:39,345
Don't try to get out of the box.

44
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:05,113
Did something bad happen?

45
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,619
Why do you assume that something bad happened to me?

46
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:15,256
I'm good at reading the room.

47
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,760
What kind of person who is good at reading the room asks so directly?

48
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,330
You have to coax me into saying it.

49
00:05:31,823 --> 00:05:33,990
I'll be back from the restroom.

50
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,480
Okay.

51
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,380
What are you looking for?

52
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,050
Oh, I'm just waiting for my friend.

53
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,895
Are you going on a trip?

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,750
Yes.

55
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,260
With your girlfriend?

56
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,908
No, with a boyfriend.

57
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:13,138
You know fireworks are a must when you guys travel together through Yeongdong Highway, right?

58
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:16,801
Isn't it illegal to light fireworks on the beach these days?

59
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:19,662
That's why they don't sell it on the beach, but we do here.

60
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,074
Let me see.

61
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,041
Here, it's a gift to you since you are handsome.

62
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,971
- Thank you.
- No worries.

63
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,170
What are those?

64
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,519
This? It's fireworks.

65
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,588
A random guy gave them to me.

66
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:15,375
Really? Some guy gave me something, too.

67
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,910
What's that?

68
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,456
I think it's a trot songs mixtape.

69
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:22,224
Let's listen to it.

70
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,610
What the heck is this?

71
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,978
I don't know.

72
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:43,090
Turn it off!

73
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,130
A guy gave me and told me it's a compilation of trot songs.

74
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,290
Let's go!

75
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,190
♫ <i>100 points out of 100 points, are you dreaming?</i> ♫

76
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,610
♫ <i>Then hurry up</i> ♫

77
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,810
♫ <i>Please accept me</i> ♫

78
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,130

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,680
♫ <i>What is love</i> ♫

80
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,140
♫ <i>You like me, if I like you</i> ♫

81
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,881
We're here.

82
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,701
Thanks for driving.

83
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,513
Why did you want to come to the beach?

84
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:55,335
Is that your way of sussing something out?

85
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,272
Let's go.

86
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,252
Why aren't you sitting down?

87
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,722
If I get sand on me, I'll be itchy all day.

88
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:20,876
You can go over there and blow it off with a machine.

89
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,879
Are you happy now that you are at the beach?

90
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,220
Yes.

91
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,510
Isn't it strange?

92
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:40,754
Why is it so nice just to be near the ocean?

93
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:45,426
I'm still a little scared of the ocean.

94
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,286
Why?

95
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:51,940
When I was in elementary school, I was a boy scout.

96
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,436
But one day, Joon Pyo forced me to join the Sea Cadets.

97
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:58,948
I was in the Sea Cadets too.

98
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:08,508
But the kids from other schools hazed me in the ocean.

99
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:14,897
With you was my first time back to the ocean after that.

100
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:25,124
Boy Scout, Girl Scout, youth association, and Sea Cadet. Everyone has trauma from those places.

101
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,255
Why were parents so eager to send their kids there?

102
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,659
Do you also have trauma?

103
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:41,649
I hated sleeping with other kids.

104
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,068
What?

105
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:49,231
How can you call that trauma compared to water torture?

106
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,656
Are we going to surf?

107
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,242
Let's just rest for today.

108
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,189
"For today?" Are we sleeping over?

109
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:08,559
We've come all the way here, so it's a shame to make a day trip.

110
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:34,018
How's it going with Ae Ri?

111
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:38,414
Ae Ri? We're just friends.

112
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,561
You should've walked Ae Ri home that night. Why did you walk me home?

113
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,596
Don't you have any common sense?

114
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:51,510
Ae Ri doesn't like to be treated like that. And we are just friends!

115
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,934
When I ask about your relationship, does it make me seem like a nosy old man?

116
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,895
Yes, a little bit.

117
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:10,304
Why did you want to come to the beach with me? You have a lot of friends.

118
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,476
It's because you don't know me well.

119
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,780
What does that mean?

120
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,580
It's literal.

121
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,750
I feel more comfortable around you because you don't know all my baggage.

122
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,968
Jae Won.

123
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,322
Nothing.

124
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,184
Why? What was it?

125
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,286
I just called your name for no reason.

126
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:46,924
Wait, are you coaxing out my answer like this?

127
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:48,642
It's not like that.

128
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:53,664
You are slyer than I expected. I was almost fooled.

129
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,044
Then do you also not know me well, either?

130
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,832
Of course. We are getting to know each other now.

131
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:08,587
And you are a freshman, so everything is a beginning for you.

132
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,658
You don't know that maybe something might've happened to me during high school.

133
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,820
Something like your water torture story?

134
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,310
Hyung!

135
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm just kidding.

136
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:22,001
It's very clear you don't have anything to worry about.

137
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,203
How do you know that?

138
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:29,858
It's because you're so pure.

139
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,591
You seem to have a lot on your mind.

140
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,868
Right?

141
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,011
Hyung, stand right here. I'll take a photo for your social media.

142
00:13:57,011 --> 00:14:00,472
Do you know the vibe of photos for social media?

143
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,543
I learned it from Ae Ri. So stand right there, and I'll take a good one.

144
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,285
Really?

145
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,463
Are you okay?

146
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:55,202
They actually sell this type of stuff here.

147
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:58,013
I think you overdid it.

148
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:04,811
You should've told me we were going to hike. You said the beach.

149
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:14,146
Have you been wearing these all day?

150
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,540
You should've told me.

151
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,308
Hold on a second.

152
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,811
So close.

153
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:43,734
Hey.

154
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:47,129
Yeah?

155
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:52,910
I was thinking...

156
00:15:54,554 --> 00:16:00,793
Why did we sit on the beach before when we had these chairs?

157
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,873
That's right. Ji Hyun, aren't you clever.

158
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:09,718
But I didn't have enough time to think about it.

159
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,892
Are we really going to stay over?

160
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,629
Why? Do you want to go back to Seoul?

161
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,225
I really didn't bring anything.

162
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,510
You told me to contact you if I'm having a hard time.

163
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:32,883
What?

164
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:38,638
When I'm having a hard time, you told me to contact you.

165
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:49,241
I'll be careful not to pry.

166
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,180
Why did you really want to come to the beach?

167
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,841
Have you ever experienced death?

168
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:11,755
Not yet. My grandparents are all alive.

169
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:21,365
I had a younger brother.

170
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,990
You're twenty years old this year.

171
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,230
He is the same age as you.

172
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,860
No. He would've been the same age as you.

173
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:40,150
My brother died when I was in high school.

174
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,170
In front of my eyes.

175
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:12,841
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what to say.

176
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:21,600
Everyone is curious about how it happened when they hear the story.

177
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,477
So why don't you ask me that question?

178
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,142
I think that would be painful.

179
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,920
No. That's more uncomfortable.

180
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:43,438
So what happened to him?

181
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,677
Actually, you're right.

182
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:02,199
Thinking of it, I can't.

183
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,061
Ji Hyun, you're more sensitive than me.

184
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:18,557
All this time has passed, and it is still painful for you?

185
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,703
It's hard every day.

186
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:29,793
Originally I was preparing as a photography major without my parents knowing.

187
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:38,143
So that was what you were talking about, you wanted to be a photographer.

188
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,644
Yes.

189
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:46,076
The camera my brother bought me, the last gift from him got smashed yesterday.

190
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,460
Broken?

191
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,128
Why did you bring this?

192
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:52,259
It's your first time sleeping on the beach, right?

193
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,462
Can't we just sleep somewhere inside.

194
00:20:56,462 --> 00:20:59,432
There's a sense of closeness in the outdoors.

195
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,685
I get cold easily.

196
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:04,571
This is a very warm sleeping bag.

197
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,771
Let's sleep.

198
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,703
Are you awake?

199
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:43,544
Hello.

200
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,482
Did you sleep well?

201
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:51,370
Are you sending me some early morning energy?

202
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,886
I think you were cold last night.

203
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,994
You really are sensitive to the cold.

204
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,513
Drink this.

205
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,086
Ji Hyun, you are different than the first time we met.

206
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,688
How?

207
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:51,329
If you're still scared and unsure, you would have never come to the beach with no plan and slept outdoors.

208
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,509
You've changed as well.

209
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,053
How?

210
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:04,251
At first, you pretended to be all that and it felt like you were putting up a front.

211
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,827
But now you seem at ease.

212
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,543
That's only in front of you.

213
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:23,344
I'm the same. I wouldn't have found the courage without you.

214
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,840
You're hungry, right?

215
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,377
Some surfing after eating?

216
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,104
Sounds great.

217
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,455
We're going to ride the waves hard today.

218
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:35,915
Okay.
