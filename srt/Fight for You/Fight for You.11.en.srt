(Fight for You)

2
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,470
We can make mistakes...

3
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,520
but we can't miss out on each other.

4
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,539
We can make many choices in this lifetime.

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,340
What we can't let go of,

6
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,890
we should hold onto with all we've got.

(File 11: Love Is a Matter of Mutual
Willingness and Give-and-Take.)

8
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
What?

9
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
Trying to sneak away?

10
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,340
How could I bear to leave you?

11
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,030
I just wanted to let you sleep a bit more.

12
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,920
Who was it that kept me awake all night?

13
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,270
No, we can't keep going like this.

14
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,580
Looks like I'll have to take
drastic action against Grandpa.

15
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,450
No.

16
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,110
Look at all these injuries on you.

17
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,950
My grandpa is super stubborn.

18
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,420
As long as you hold a different stance
from him,

19
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,990
he sees you as an enemy.

20
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,230
Maybe I should become a
professional soldier.

21
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,570
Would that

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,870
change your grandpa's mind?

23
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,810
No!

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,290
That'd just make it even harder for us
to see each other.

25
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,370
How about... I run away from home?

26
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,170
You need to be good.

27
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,640
Understand?

28
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,610
He is your grandpa.

29
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
I don't want you to have any regrets.

30
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,380
I hope that you and I

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,850
can have his blessing.

32
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,399
So energetic.

33
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,019
Your wounds have all healed?

34
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,850
Having been locked up all this time,
I haven't been able to exercise properly.

35
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,780
Zhouguo, is it time for breakfast?

36
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,740
You go ahead.

37
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,170
I'll be there in a moment.

38
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,290
Young man, exercise in moderation.

39
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Oh, right!

40
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,670
By the way, let me remind your friend
under the blanket.

41
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,260
Grandpa is practicing Qigong downstairs.

42
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,780
Don't try to sneak out
through the balcony.

43
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,580
If you want to leave, the back door
is a good choice.

44
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,130
Thank you, Zhouguo.

(Braised Food)

46
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,680
How long have we known each other?

47
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,890
For over 20 years, since I graduated
from primary school.

48
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,860
Then what does this money mean?

49
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,800
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

50
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,300
You suddenly brought over a sum of money.

51
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,170
Hei helped you with something, right?

52
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,909
Didn't I tell you

53
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,400
that if you didn't stop my grandson

54
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,260
from doing something wrong,

55
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,860
I'd hold you responsible?

56
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,100
I did! I stopped him!

57
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,960
-Mr. Dou!
-I stopped him!

58
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,670
Grandma, why did you hit him?

(Braised Food)

60
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,640
You...

61
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,970
You're just in time. Explain yourself.

62
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,170
Speak.

63
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,520
Ms. Hei, calm down.

64
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,860
This money is for the small favor

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
that Bai and Hei did for me last time.

66
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,890
This is a thank-you gift.

67
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,630
What kind of small favor
is worth this much?

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,240
This money is for Jiali's heart surgery

69
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,909
and post-operative care.

70
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,120
Jiali?

(Braised Food)

72
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,280
How dare you
(Braised Food)

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,409
hide this from me all this time!

74
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,180
Grandma!

75
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,320
"Going abroad for training," huh?

76
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,620
You guys ganged up to lie to me!

77
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,480
Where did you get the surgery fee?

78
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,300
Grandma, this is my money.

79
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,520
Hei has nothing to do

80
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,060
with all of that shady business.

81
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,260
I promised you, and I kept that promise.

82
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,050
Why would you want to pay
for Jiali's surgery?

83
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,150
I want you to love me a bit more.

84
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,840
How much?

85
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,580
These two jars of pickled radish
should cover it.

86
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,550
(Braised Food)
These two jars of pickled radish
should cover it.

87
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,440
You think my pickled radishes

88
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,850
are made of gold or something?

89
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,150
What you've given me

90
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,180
is more valuable than gold or diamonds.

91
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,720
Alright, don't be mad anymore.

92
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,740
It's okay, it's okay.

93
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,200
All right, take them and get out of here!

94
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,090
Don't loiter around here all day!

95
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,990
-Bye!
-Find someone to take care of yourself!

96
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,030
Which ward is Jiali in?

97
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,730
Grandma, I'll take you there.

98
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,530
No need!

99
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,260
Take care of your own mess first!

100
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,520
Each one of you is worse than the next!

101
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,580
So, Bai being gone

102
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,810
must be tied up in all of this too, right?

103
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,550
I'm warning you.

104
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,620
Even if you have to crawl on your knees,
get Bai back for me!

105
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,750
If you're a man, face this head-on!

106
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,010
If you can't bring him back, don't bother
coming back either!

107
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,380
The balcony is on the other side.

108
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,710
I'm here to see Grandpa.

109
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,210
Shh, keep it down.

110
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,159
Let's go. Hurry.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,050
Let him in.

112
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,410
I want to see what he wants.

113
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm disciplining my grandson.

114
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,690
You have a problem with that?

115
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,090
Grandpa, I'm Bai's boyfriend.

116
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,390
I'm here today to pay you a formal visit.

117
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,630
No need for visits.

118
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,170
We don't welcome strangers.

119
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,640
Please approve our relationship.

120
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,930
And why should I?

121
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,110
You have no background

122
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,280
or talent.

123
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,200
You jump from one odd job to the next,

124
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,310
associate with all sorts of shady people,

125
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,900
and have even joined
a criminal organization

126
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,390
to be their underling.

127
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,360
What gives you the confidence
to stand here at all?

128
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,970
Not to mention, you're a man,

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,490
and my grandson is also a man.

130
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,330
Don't you feel ashamed...

131
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,760
I know this may be

132
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,970
hard for you to accept.

133
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,370
I will never accept it.

134
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,400
Only an idiot like Bai Zhouqi

135
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,480
would rush into something like this.

136
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
Grandpa,

137
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,720
can you please know more about us?

138
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,240
Hei...

139
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,640
Did I say you could speak?

140
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,630
Did I say you could stand up?

141
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,360
You've gotten hurt time and again,

142
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,650
all for him.

143
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,990
You still want to defend him,

144
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,790
a man who can't even protect you?

145
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,870
I've lived my whole life

146
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,560
for others.

147
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,520
Until you stood in front of me that day.

148
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730
It was the first time I dared to think

149
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,830
that maybe I could stop caring
about everyone else

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,590
and just care about you.

151
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,790
But I didn't dare.

152
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,100
I was afraid that I wasn't worthy.

153
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,710
I was afraid that I couldn't give enough.

154
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,620
I was afraid that you'd regret it someday.

155
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,850
Grandpa.

156
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,010
I know I'm not good enough.

157
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,630
But as long as Bai wants me
by his side,

158
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,490
I'll do whatever it takes.

159
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,100
You are the person he loves
and respects the most.

160
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,270
I hope to get your approval.

161
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,150
Don't even think about it

162
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,820
in this life.

163
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,080
Then I'll prove it to you
through my persistence.

164
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,510
In your world, there may be

165
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,570
clear lines between right and wrong.

166
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,980
But in mine,

167
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,550
everything about Bai defines those lines.

168
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,360
Bai.

169
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,340
Zhouguo.

170
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,020
He has to pass

171
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,850
Grandpa's test himself.

172
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,270
Zhouguo.

173
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,220
Go.

174
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,650
Go.

175
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,180
(Hei)

176
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,710
I want to be by your side openly
and with pride.
(Hei)

177
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,500
I don't want you sneaking around, hiding.

178
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,440
And I definitely don't want you

179
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,050
to live the rest of your life
under Grandpa's disapproval.

180
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,280
In the future,

181
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,370
just treat me better to make up for it.

182
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,980
I want to be by your side openly
and with pride.

183
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,710
I don't want you sneaking around, hiding.

184
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,870
And I definitely don't want you

185
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,400
to live the rest of your life
under Grandpa's disapproval.

186
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,600
In the future,

187
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,690
just treat me better to make up for it.

188
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,160
Grandma.

189
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,000
Grandma.

190
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,710
Hei has been kneeling for a whole day.

191
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,600
He'll dehydrate at this rate.

192
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
Please go bring him back, okay?

193
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,390
Kneeling for a whole day?

194
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,720
Tell me clearly!

195
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
What's going on outside?

196
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,080
He came to ask Grandpa for permission

197
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,830
for himself and Bai to be together.

198
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,430
His courage is commendable.

199
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,650
Wait a sec.

200
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
What?

201
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,340
They've both sacrificed so much
for each other.

202
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,800
It's very touching, okay?

203
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,060
Come here.

204
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,940
You don't look presentable enough.

205
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Advisor Bai will scold you for that.

206
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,310
He's been in a bad mood lately.

207
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,570
Be careful not to get caught in his anger.

208
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,630
Hey.

209
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,090
Don't just worry about others.

210
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,800
Take care of yourself too.

211
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,120
So, you're Bai Gangzheng's grandson.

212
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,060
What do you mean?

213
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,930
Grandma, you know my grandpa?

214
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,120
I saw you when you were little too.

215
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,650
The first time we met

216
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,580
was at your father's funeral.

217
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,190
You were still small back then,

218
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,080
hugging your brother and crying.

219
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,690
Bai Gangzheng scolded you like hell.

220
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,520
You were there, Grandma?

221
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,630
Then you must know

222
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,060
how scary my grandpa is.

223
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,960
Grandma.

224
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,390
Please go persuade Hei to come back, okay?

225
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,930
He always listens to you.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,270
Listen to me?

227
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,790
He needs to be taught a lesson this time!

228
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,990
He lied to me!

229
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,140
You were complicit too, right?

230
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,780
Keeping Jiali's hospitalization a secret
from me!

231
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,210
Actually, to catch Dou Keyi,

232
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,700
I was sent undercover to Hei's side.

233
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,940
I saw

234
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,320
Hei being used

235
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,690
as a scapegoat...

236
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,620
in one of Dou Keyi's deals,

237
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,080
so I blocked a shot for him.

238
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,770
When Grandpa found out,

239
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,730
he got furious and locked me up,

240
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,290
not letting me see Hei.

241
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,100
Grandma.

242
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,340
Although

243
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,870
I approached Hei with a purpose
in the beginning,

244
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,540
I genuinely fell in love with him.

245
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,030
Grandma, please trust me.

246
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,950
Good for him.

247
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,110
Doing all of this behind my back
yet not taking care of yourself properly.

248
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,110
Grandma.

249
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,060
Grandma, it wasn't Hei's fault!

250
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,640
Go on, keep spoiling him.

251
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,940
Men won't learn without getting

252
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,140
taught a lesson!

253
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,450
Grandma!

254
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,950
Grandma!

255
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,240
Grandma, don't...

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,250
Stop hitting him!

257
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,550
You dare to run?

258
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,710
Grandma, stop hitting him!

259
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,640
No!

260
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,280
You hid Jiali's condition from me,

261
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,640
so I couldn't take proper care of
my granddaughter!

262
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,580
And for money, you almost went astray

263
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,570
and made a big mistake!

264
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,120
Do you have any idea?

265
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
You put yourself in danger

266
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,150
and even dragged innocent Bai into this!

267
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,060
That's another crime on top!

268
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,560
I...

269
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,359
Who's making a scene in my house?

270
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,369
What?

271
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,109
I can't hit people?

272
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,130
Hei... Hei...

273
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,640
Hei what?

274
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,260
Haven't seen each other
for over ten years;

275
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,060
don't you recognize me anymore?

276
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,849
Why are you here?

277
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,849
Aren't you supposed to be upstairs?

278
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,930
Keep your voice down.

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,440
Raising grandchildren isn't like
commanding subordinates.

280
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,650
Why so fierce?

281
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,770
Well? Aren't you going to
introduce me to them?

282
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,030
This is Ms. Hei Shilin,

283
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,810
also known as the Black Rose,

284
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,890
a formidable figure who can
shake things up.

285
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,410
(Black Rose = Hei Shilin)

286
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,610
People from both sides of the law

287
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,970
owe favors to the Black Rose.

288
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,120
Sister, what kind of major event

289
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,120
brings you here in person today?

290
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,010
I heard you made my grandson kneel
for two days.

291
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,770
Your grandson?

292
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,500
Your grandson, Bai, has got his eye
on my Hei.

293
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,370
You're not happy with that?

294
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,140
No, no, well...

295
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,690
T-They...

296
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,350
What about them?

297
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,530
I raised Hei myself.

298
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,920
Are you despising me?

299
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,610
No.

300
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,960
That's not what I meant.

301
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,130
Then what?

302
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,750
Your Bai family has never been good
with women.

303
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,170
Bai has finally found

304
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,060
someone as good as my Hei.

305
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,310
Look how happy they are together.

306
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,460
What do you think?

307
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,940
Do you approve of their relationship
or not?

308
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,420
I...

309
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,560
I understand.

310
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,820
You care about face, right?

311
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,860
Let's talk in private. Come on.

312
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,890
We can just talk here.

313
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,250
Afraid I'll eat you or something? Come on!

314
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,720
Are you okay?

315
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,350
Have some water first.

316
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,630
You used to take care of Dou Keyi
like that,

317
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,180
when he was punished, right?

318
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,370
Zhouguo, you know Dou Keyi too?

319
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,460
He's a legend.

320
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,590
Who in the Intelligence Bureau
doesn't know him?

321
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,820
No Sir,

322
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,620
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,800
I've let you down.

324
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,420
If I could have

325
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,500
been like you back then...

326
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,210
risking my future

327
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,600
to trust him,

328
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,430
maybe...

329
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,610
I could have pulled him back.

330
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,850
But instead,

331
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,100
I pushed him away, along with
everyone else.

332
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,150
Maybe...

333
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,530
I was the one who betrayed him.

334
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,020
Why so sentimental all of a sudden?

335
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,050
Why are you like a drunkard?

336
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,670
Carrying this around every day.

337
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,400
I don't carry it every day.

338
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,370
Only when you're around.

339
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,690
Zhouguo,

340
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,220
why are you talking to No Sir

341
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,670
so gently?

342
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,330
Gave me goosebumps.

343
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,210
Mind your own business.

344
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,140
We are elites.

345
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,330
Don't be influenced by kids.

346
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,090
Let's go.

347
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,500
Kids are still better than you,
lonely singles!

348
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,070
Don't envy us!

349
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
The men in your Bai family

350
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,020
are really terrible.

351
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,040
Couldn't keep your mother

352
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
and your wife.

353
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,630
You couldn't even keep your own woman.

354
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,120
So, you want to drive Bai out too?

355
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,030
Let the kids handle their own lives.

356
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,180
They have their own battles to fight.

357
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,040
We shouldn't always think

358
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,250
we can shield them from everything.

359
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,110
Think about how glorious I was back then.

360
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,840
But my son

361
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,260
just couldn't get through his own battles.

362
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,360
Hei, Bai!

363
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,040
Come here.

364
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,630
Since you two have found each other,

365
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,880
cherish what you have.

366
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,840
Understand?

367
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,180
Bai, don't worry.

368
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,020
My grandson is a good boy.

369
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,450
That's right.

370
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,070
Alright, come on, let's keep chatting.
Let's go.

371
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,660
Let's go. Stop looking.

372
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,380
Thank you for everything...

373
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,430
you've done for me.

374
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,630
Now there's no escape for you anymore.

375
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,610
Besides Grandma and Jiali,

376
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,680
now you have me too.

377
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,710
I swear...

378
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,930
We will live a good life.

379
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,410
If there's ever anything I don't do right,

380
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,060
you have to tell me.

381
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,260
Because I want our relationship

382
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,420
to last a very, very long time.

383
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,210
You stink.

384
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,470
Really?

385
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,330
I'm kidding!

386
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,840
One more kiss.

387
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,530
No! You're grossed out by me!

388
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,090
-Come on, I'm not.
-No!

389
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,450
One more kiss!

390
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,900
One more!

391
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,970
Don't...

392
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,250
One more.

393
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,610
You think I'm stinky.

394
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,860
No, kiss me before we go home.

395
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,460
Back then, everything I did
was for Grandpa.

But now I have you.

400
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,620
If I had trusted you more back then,

401
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,150
would things be different now?

402
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,980
I just came to check on you.

403
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,670
Don't abandon me.

404
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,540
As a man of loyalty...

405
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,860
If you find dating troublesome,

406
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,390
then just get married.

407
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,290
Get married.

408
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,280
Get married?

409
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,370
You're stuck

410
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,540
with me for life.
