Right and wrong stand clear,

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,250
a chasm wide and sheer.

4
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,960
No doubts,

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,190
no gray areas.

6
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,490
The last thing one should do

7
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,360
is to betray justice

8
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
and go against its path.

(File 3: A two-faced life riddled with flaws)

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,210
You moved out

11
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,560
because of him?

12
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm sad and disappointed.

13
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,590
You thought

14
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,890
I couldn't accept this,

15
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,790
so you moved out without a word?

16
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,949
Hei,

17
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,390
what kind of person do you think I am?

18
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,330
In your eyes,

19
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm a stubborn old woman you can't reason with.

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,230
Is that it?

21
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,480
No.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,860
I didn't want you to worry.

23
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,210
Go away.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,010
Come.

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,680
Look, he's always like this.

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,280
He keeps everything to himself, carrying it all alone.

27
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,180
Did you ever ask me?

28
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,910
How did you know I wouldn't accept him?

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,300
He

30
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,370
is all height,

31
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,800
no brains.

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,730
Once, a scammer called, saying

33
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,530
something happened to his sister.

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,680
He cried so hard and he almost sold himself.

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,170
I was scared because I was ignorant.

36
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm not stupid.

37
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,030
Bai, you look much smarter than him.

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,160
I'll leave my grandson

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,670
to you.

40
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,540
Since you are in love,

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,730
you two should get along well.

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
Your grandma is so open-minded?

43
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,930
How are we supposed to break up then?

44
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,370
Grandma,

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,829
we are both men.

46
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,700
Aren't you worried that others would think...

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,650
think we...

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,579
Hey.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,370
What?

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,060
There's a cockroach.

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,430
What's there to be worried about?

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,630
You've met someone who you can show your weakness to.

53
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,829
I'm happy for you.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,090
All right.

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,330
What's with this look?

56
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,380
It's okay.

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,580
Whether it's a man or a woman,

58
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,920
who you love is what matters most.

59
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,380
I'll always support you.

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Bai, come.

61
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,640
Let's add each other on Line.

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,070
Come to the braised food stall

63
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,220
when you have time.

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,490
I'll cook something delicious for you.

65
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,120
Okay.

66
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,150
Grandma.

67
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,530
In order not to make you worry,

69
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,020
I lied to you.

70
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,890
All right, I'm leaving.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,610
Go back.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
Remember to bring him along.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Don't stand there.

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Just go in.

75
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,520
I feel your grandma

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,480
is different from other people's grandma.

77
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,900
Since I was little, if she ever found out

78
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,100
I was bullied at school,

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,320
she'd go seek justice for me.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,300
All my classmates knew they shouldn't mess with me.

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,780
She

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,970
loves you very much.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
She loves me and my sister very much.

84
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,490
But she's scary when she gets angry.

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,050
Then how dare you lie to her

86
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,310
about living with your girlfriend?

87
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,650
It's my job.

88
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,780
I come home with injuries every time.

89
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,920
In order not to worry her,

90
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,460
I moved out.

91
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,890
Isn't the work at the convenience house

92
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,490
about helping people solve problems?

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,490
Why would you get hurt?

94
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,260
I don't just work at the convenience house.

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,690
I have another job.

96
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,190
You seem to be very interested in the convenience house.

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm just concerned about you.

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,540
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,710
Anyway, I'm sorry that I got you involved.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,950
If your grandma really takes you back,

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,610
who should I keep an eye on?

102
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,690
Oh, right.

103
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,680
Well,

104
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,130
since Grandma didn't object to us,

105
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,030
should we continue

106
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,460
to pretend to be a couple?

107
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,040
Are you okay with that?

108
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,420
What do you mean?

109
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,100
Well...

110
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,440
do you have someone else to report to?

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,270
Or is there someone else who would care?

112
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't worry. I'm single.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,990
Helping you is no problem.

114
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,910
Okay.

115
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,620
So...

116
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,290
we are on the same team now?

117
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,520
For now.

118
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,510
We're on the same team.

119
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,870
We're on the same team, right?

120
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,240
Let me help you.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,410
Let me ask you.

122
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,370
Are you...

123
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,130
Very nice to you.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,230
Right?

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,380
I'm very nice to you.

126
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,200
I'm very nice to you. I'm very nice to you.

127
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,700
Hey.

128
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,190
Actually, I envy your relationship with Grandma.

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,510
But I've never met his expectations.

The gap between us

133
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,860
is this big.

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,260
No.

135
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,340
It should be this big.

136
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,690
No.

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,990
It should be this big.

138
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,270

140
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,180

141
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,080
so much about myself?

142
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,660
I think the way you are now is just fine.

143
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,970
That was the first time someone told me

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,380
I don't have to try harder to be someone else.

is to get information from him

Sorry.

166
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,350

I didn't see it.

It was not your girlfriend anyway.

171
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,410
Because the real one is here.

172
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,010
Right?

173
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,010
Did he say anything?

But he hung up after he said that.

176
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,540
Did a regular customer ask you to buy something?

177
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,830
Yes.

178
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,150
The client asked me to buy some tools

179

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,790
so I thought of Grandma's braised food stall.

193
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,200
Grandma asked you to take me there.

194
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,460
Why haven't you taken me there?

195
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,600
I...

196
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,770
Just so happens.

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,280
Look.

198
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,860
(Grandma, I'm Bai. I'm hungry.)
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)

199
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,570
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)
Look.

200
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,280
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)

201
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,590
Grandma said she'll cook something delicious
(Grandma, I'm Bai. I'm hungry.)
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)

202
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,620
(Grandma, I'm Bai. I'm hungry.)
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)

203
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,990
for me.
(Grandma, I'm Bai. I'm hungry.)
(Come. I'll cook something delicious for you.)

204
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,450
Do you want to go with me?

205
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,910
Come on. Let's go.

206
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,420
I don't know where the braised food stall is.

207
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,580
Let's go.

208
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,390
Lead the way.

209
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:42,980
Which way?

210
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,810
That way?

211
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,710
(Braised Food)

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,760
They look delicious.

213
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,830
Grandma, these look delicious.

214
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,330
Eat as much as you can.

215
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,370
Okay.

216
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,100
What do you want?

217
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,870
Order as much as you can.

218
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,090
I want mini sausages.

219
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,330
One portion of tofu skin.

220
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,260
I'll give you a little more.

221
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,920
Okay.

222
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,440
Grandma.

223
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,250
Here.

224
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,620
Business is really good.

225
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,210
When business is good,

226
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,870
I worry Grandma might get too tired.

227
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,180
When business is slow,

228
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,530
I worry she can't make enough money.

229
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,570
Eat.

230
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,670
Grandma is watching.

231
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,180
What was your major?

232
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,270
Physical education.

233
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,840
Physical education?

234
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,530
Why did you choose your current job

235
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,680
instead of being a teacher

236
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,820
or a fitness coach or something?

237
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,050
I did.

238
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,470
I was a PE teacher.

239
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,550
But something happened to my family later.

240
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,190
I need to make more money.

241
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,830
So you can make a lot of money

242
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,450
at Dou Keyi Convenience House?

243
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,330
I just want to know how much you need.

244
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,030
I can lend it to you.

245
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,820
No need.

246
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,510
Talking about money with friends can ruin the friendships.

247
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,510
Friends?

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
Friends?

249
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,420
Yes.

250
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,770
We're friends.

251
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,400
And I'm your boyfriend.

252
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,990
Your grandma's braised food is really delicious.

253
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,970
Yes, listen,

254
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,310
the pig's trotters she makes are absolutely amazing.

255
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,990
But I like kelp sprouts.

256
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,300
Kelp sprouts are delicious, right?

257
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,930
I haven't been so relaxed for a long time.

258
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,780
I don't think you've been that busy.

259
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,410
You don't understand.

260
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,740
Being forced to do something you're not good at

261
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,790
is really painful.

262
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,150
So...

263
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,830
being a postgraduate is not what you want?

264
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,950
This is life.

265
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,190
Not everyone is like your grandma.

266
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,730
Grandma

267
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,140
always told us

268
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,250
life is short.

269
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,970
So,

270
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,420
just don't have regrets.

271
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,350
What about your sister?

272
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,800
Grandma said you sent her abroad.

273
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,570
Why put so much pressure on yourself?

274
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,290
Didn't you want to watch the game?

275
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,510
Let's go.

276
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,180
Hurry!

277
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,710
So why did you send your sister abroad?

278
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,510
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,240
Hei.

280
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Take off your clothes.

281
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,150
What do you want to do?

282
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,880
To do the laundry.

283
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,540
Hey, what are you doing?

284
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,140
You really know how to get hurt.

285
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,720
Why do you have such a huge bruise on your waist again?

286
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,300
It looks like a fresh one.

287
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,910
Did Screwdriver No. 3 hit you?

288
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,390
Perhaps I accidentally bumped into something

289
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,750
when I was moving goods.

290
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,390
It doesn't hurt.

291
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,590
No wonder you're worried Grandma would worry.

292
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,060
It's easy to get bruised while doing sports or moving goods.

293
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,930
It's okay.

294
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,290
Come on. Let's play another round.

295
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,790
With you being so careless,

296
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,300
why do you still do this job?

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,230
For your sister.

298
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,520
Looks like

299
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,750
Dou Keyi lent him money.

300
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,000
He owes him a favor.

301
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,520
With his straightforward personality,

302
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,090
he'll definitely do his best.

303
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,730
Although I'm not that capable,

304
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,380
as long as you need me,

305
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,910
I'm here.

306
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,490
Hey.

307
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,970
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)

308
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,400
Do you want some water?

309
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,100
No?

310
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,730
Let's go.

311
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,770
Morning, Di.

312
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,720
Hey.

313
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,780
I know Mr. Dou has always been protective of you,

314
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,020
but

315
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,660
there are things that still need to be done.

316
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,950
Di, give orders anytime.

317
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,140
I won't let Mr. Dou know.

318
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
Wait a minute.

319
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,570
Go swap the tie bear for a lace bear.

320
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,450
Be careful.

321
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,950
The lace bear must not get dirty.

322
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,800
Come back as soon as you get it.

323
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,570
The client will check it personally.

324
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,490
Be careful.

325
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,480
Come on. Let's go.

326
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,270
(Wrench No. 11)
(My love for you is endless)

327
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,950
(Wrench No. 11)

328
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,370
(Wrench No. 11)

329
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,490
Handsome guy, are you waiting for someone?

330
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,460
I'm not waiting for a person.

331
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,880
Are you waiting for me?

332
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,280
Or anyone will do?

333
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,170
You're so boring.

334
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,580
Lower your head.

335
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,770
Otherwise, how am I supposed to tell you the password?

336
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,110
My love for you is endless.

337
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,220
Where is it?

338
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,850
What's the rush?

339
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,440
Bai?

340
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,050
Why are you here?

341
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,390
You're bleeding a lot.

342
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,380
Blood?

343
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,180
I think Hei Yubo is different from the others

344
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,170
of Dou Keyi Convenience House.

345
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,550
You think?

346
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,970
That day, you said our relationship

347
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,970
started to be different.

348
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,120
How?

349
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,870
Although we're not a real couple,

350
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,180
we live together and shared weal and woe.

351
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,530
Isn't that different?

352
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,970
Just friends?

353
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,410
Because you said

354
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,740
you are my boyfriend.

355
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,460
That's why you're so nice to me.
