1
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,900
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,270
People around me always say I have an overflow of sympathy,

3
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,190
but I just feel

4
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,710
behind every situation, there's a reason for it.

5
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,500
Isn't that right?

6
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,000
(File 2: Become one of yours)

7
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,250
My family, just like my surname,

8
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,090
cannot tolerate any stains.

9
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,720
But there are times

10
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,460
when you have to accept things.

11
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,360
Such as me,

12
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,470
Bai Zhouqi.

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,730
Bai Zhouqi.

14
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,050
If your surveillance target

15
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,590
and a colleague from the Intelligence Bureau both fall into the sea,

16
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,850
who would you save?

17
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,550
Is the other party elderly, weak, or a child?

18
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,640
Can the other party swim?

19
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,760
Is the other party injured?

20
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,730
Bai Zhouqi!

21
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,760
There are only two kinds of people in this world.

22
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,620
One is the righteous side like us,

23
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,320
and the other is the enemy side.

24
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,860
Yes!

25
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,850
If you encounter a situation during a mission,

26
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,940
how would you solve it?

27
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,550
Can right and wrong

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,740
be judged without even understanding

29
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,480
the situation first?

30
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,970
Bu Xing.

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,840
Yes.

32
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,570
Bai Zhouqi has always been

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
too soft-hearted and indecisive

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,500
since childhood.

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,079
Help him get back on the right path.

36
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,550
Advisor, you're being modest.

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,700
Zhouqi is your grandson.

38
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,770
He must be outstanding.

39
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,420
He inherited neither my traits

40
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,079
nor half —

41
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,270
no,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,520
not even a third — of his brother's caliber.

43
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,140
Discipline him strictly.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,860
Don't worry about my feelings.

45
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,210
Yes.

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,040
From now on,

47
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,420
you should follow the chief's guidance.

48
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,560
Remember,

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,030
your actions

50
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,170
represent the Bai family.

51
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,780
I won't disappoint Grandpa

53
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,210
or Chief.

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,510
Bai Zhouqi.

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,640
When I came here from Hong Kong,

56
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,990
it was your grandfather who trained me.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
I didn't even dare to breathe loudly in front of him.

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,590
But you don't need to be like that in front of me.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Relax.

60
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,350
However, I will still speak my mind.

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,330
Understand?

62
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,250
Yes, sir!

63
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,160
Call me No Sir.

64
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,230
Yes, sir!

65
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,080
No Sir.

66
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,850
(Leader) (Dou Keyi Convenience House)

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,820
Come here.

68
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,660
Oh.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,180
(Dou Keyi, the leader)

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,780
Dou Keyi?

71
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,510
It's said that as long as you pay,

72
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,710
the owner of Dou Keyi Convenience House

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,820
can solve any problem for you.

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,770
Any problem?

75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,980
It's actually crying up wine and selling vinegar.

76
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,600
On the surface, he's a good neighbor,

77
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,780
walking dogs and looking for cats.

78
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,330
But behind the scenes,

79
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,830
he's involved in smuggling, murder, and serving as a middleman.

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,900
He plays both sides.

81
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,090
(Smuggling origins: Thailand, Myanmar) (Contact person: Xiong)

82
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,090
I've been unable to find concrete criminal evidence against him.
(Smuggling origins: Thailand, Myanmar) (Contact person: Xiong)

83
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,420
Those who got caught all have the same story.

84
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,170
Even the informants we sent couldn't gather any solid proof.

85
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,900
It's as if nothing is connected to him at all.

86
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,970
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,770
Do you know what that means?

88
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,930
It means he might be innocent.

89
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,990
It means

90
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,410
Dou Keyi is far more meticulous and subtle

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,800
than we thought.

92
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,090
Understand?

93
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,500
Mm.

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,420
Someone who seems harmless on the surface

95
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,740
but is secretly using others for his gain

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,460
must not be spared.

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,750
We must bring him to justice.

98
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,650
Arrest him!

99
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,960
That's your surveillance target.

100
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,290
(Hei Yubo
Nickname: Hei
Fitness coach)

101
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,490
Hei Yubo.
(Hei Yubo
Nickname: Hei
Fitness coach)

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,620
His nickname is Hei.

103
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,490
He's a new member of Dou Keyi Convenience House.

104
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,760
He's treated like a younger brother by Dou Keyi.

105
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,440
He looks like a small fry.

106
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,890
He's about your age.

107
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,890
Get close to him first,

108
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
gather information,

109
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,130
and then we'll take them all down

110
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,850
at one stroke.

111
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,760
Mm!

112
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,150
All tasks are of the same importance.

113
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,850
It's all about how much effort we put in.

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,070
Understand?

115
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,190
Yes, sir!

116
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
No Sir!

117
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,820
Go.

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,909
Advisor Bai's precious grandson,

119
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,510
just collect information.

120
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,560
If anything happens to you,

121
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
I can't afford to take the blame.

122
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,450
I've been following him for a week.

123
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,710
Looks like Hei's tasks

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,940
are really...

125
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,990
ordinary.

126
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,270
Will these reports help No Sir?

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,640
At this rate,

128
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,670
when can I find solid evidence

129
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,390
of Dou Keyi's crimes?

130
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,130
And

131
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,110
if the distance is not close enough,

132
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,340
I can't even catch a single word

133
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
of their conversation.

134
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,470
How can I get closer to him?

135
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,450
No, no.

136
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,710
Don't misunderstand.

137
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,020
This is so embarrassing!

138
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,950
Does he think I...

139
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,490
Yeah, I'll double-check for you next week.

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,960
How have you been lately?

141
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,660
Not bad.

142
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,110
What about your sister?

143
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,310
The doctor has scheduled the surgery.

144
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,470
Let me know if you need anything.

145
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,520
Okay.

146
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,530
Mr. Dou,

147
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,760
actually, I've been wanting to tell you...

148
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,660
Hey.

149
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,200
Save me the nagging stuff.

150
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,440
Here.

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,700
What's wrong with your hand?

152
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,410
Nothing.

153
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,180
If Ms. Hei finds out,

154
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,510
we're both dead.

155
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,590
Don't worry.

156
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,400
I won't implicate you.

157
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,300
What I meant is

158
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,470
it's just a job,

159
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,260
so don't take it so seriously, okay?

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,340
Isn't being an elementary school PE teacher nice?

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,760
Rest assured.

162
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,890
Hei Yubo and Dou Keyi's relationship

163
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,370
is really special.

164
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,970
He must know something.

165
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,090
Be careful on the way.

166
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,250
Bye bye.

167
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,980
Who are you?

168
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,730
No.

169
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,270
-Come!
-I was just passing by.

170
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,970
Come here!

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,260
You were sneaking around. What are you up to?

172
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,600
I want to make a request for help.

173
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,820
Bai?

174
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,210
What are you doing here?

175
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,660
Hey.

176
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,680
You know him?

177
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,120
He's my roommate.

178
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,550
Hello.

179
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,550
I heard Dou Keyi Convenience House can help solve any problem.

180
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,660
You heard?

181
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,110
Where did you hear that?

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,450
There.

183
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,510
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)
There.

184
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,200
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)

185
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,320
Kid,

186
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,780
what's your request?

187
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
I want you to accept my interview.

188
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,460
-Interview?
-Interview?

189
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,220
Mm.

190
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,870
What are you doing?

191
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,950
What interview?

192
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,530
If I can't finish my interview,

193
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,240
I won't be able to graduate.

194
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,710
Then my grandpa will beat me to death.

195
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,370
Hey!

196
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,410
What do you want to interview us about?

197
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
The topic is

198
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,530
the pros and cons of multi-business operations

199
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,310
for community workers

200
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,180
and the importance

201
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,750
of ethical education and cultural influence.

202
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,590
Wait. I need to take this call.

203
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,120
Hello?

204
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,310
Di.

205
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,790
He's a postgraduate.

206
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,800
He's writing his thesis.

207
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,320
So you knew each other before?

208
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,350
We knew each other after renting the place.

209
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,780
Renting the place?

210
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,290
That was when you just joined the convenience house, right?

211
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,900
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,260
I have to go.

213
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,370
Hey.

214
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,720
What about your thesis interview?

215
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,110
Of course I'll do it.

216
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,180
I'll come to you next time.

217
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,070
See you.

218
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,300
Make a request?

219
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,230
He didn't even ask about the fee and just ran off.

220
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,750
I hope I'm just overthinking it.

221
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,460
Our business is very complicated.

222
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,720
Many people on both sides of the law want to take Mr. Dou down.

223
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,740
Stay sharp.

224
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,630
Spacing out?

225
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,860
Let's go.

226
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,110
No Sir.

227
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,380
The informant told me

228
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,910
you approached Shi Difen at the convenience house.

229
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,370
Do you know why

230
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,580
I called you back?

231
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,700
You must have your reason.

232
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
But I just don't quite understand.

233
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,770
Before you,

234
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,520
some of your seniors also lurked around.

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,150
But one by one, they got exposed.

236
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,890
They are more cunning than we thought.

237
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,700
I don't want you to walk the same path.

238
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Understand?

239
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,790
Just focus on Hei.

240
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,890
Thank you for the warning, No Sir.

241
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,910
(Surveillance Report)

242
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,130
I think Hei Yubo is inexperienced.

243

(Unusual Behaviors or Events)
I think Hei Yubo is inexperienced.

245
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,400
Is there a way to make him one of us?

246
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
One of us?

247
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,390
I'll do my best.

248
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,850
Okay.

250
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,420
Hello?

251
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Mr. Hei,

252
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,080
the boss is going abroad for a while.

253
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,840
Training sessions are on hold for now.

254
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,300
I'll let you know when he's back.

255
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,330
Okay. Got it.

256
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,190
What's that sound?

257
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,080
What is he doing inside?

258
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,320
What were you doing at the door?

259
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,150
I saw a cockroach.

260
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,250
I wanted to help you get rid of it.

261
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,290
Where?

262
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,810
(Grandma)

Recently,

264
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,200
has he been a little...

265
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,380
weird?

266
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,650
Here.

267
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,440
Open your mouth.

268
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,080
Open your mouth.

269
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,720
Open your mouth.

270
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,420
What kind of job

271
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,100
gets you hurt like this?

272
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,760
How can I get closer to him?

273
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,920
No, no.

274
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,240
Don't misunderstand.

275
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,700
If I can't finish my interview,

276
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,660
I won't be able to graduate.

277
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,150
Am I imagining this?

278
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,850
Why do I feel...

279
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,130
he is...

280
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,000
Grandma?

281
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,080
Why are you here?

282
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,510
I can't come?

283
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,290
That's not what I meant.

284
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,040
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

285
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,160
I called, but you didn't answer my call.

286
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,540
Where?

287
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,850
Where is what?

288
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,850
Grandma.

289
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,870
Grandma.

290
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,080
Where?

291
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,620
Where is what?

292
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,330
Where is she?

293
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,510
Who?

294
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,400
Grandma. Grandma.

295
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,630
Who?

296
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,010
The woman who wouldn't let me come.

297
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,319
Where is she?

298
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,619
No such thing.

299
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,040
No?

300
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,359
She didn't forbid me to come?

301
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,050
Or...

302
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,609
there is no such person?

303
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,390
If there is no such person,

304
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,760
I...

305
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,560
I wouldn't have needed to move out.

306
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,430
It's just...

307
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,200
It's just she's not here.

308
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,829
Not here?

309
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,020
Okay, I'll wait for her here.

310
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,460
Grandma.

311
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,680
No, she...

312
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,590
She...

313
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,450
She might come back very late.

314
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,050
How about this?

315
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,690
I'll take her to the braised food stall to see you.

316
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,190
Okay?

317
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,650
Come on.

318
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,250
Let's go.

319
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:39,890
Let's go.

320
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Why are you so flustered?

321
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,490
I just want to see

322
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,950
what kind of woman my grandson likes.

323
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,100
Are you shy?

324
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,670
Grandma, go home and rest first.

325
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,160
I'll introduce her to you when I have time.

326
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,260
Don't be so flustered.

327
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,760
You'll scare her.

328
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,840
Why are you so nervous?

329
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,220
Isn't she almost one of us already?

330
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,920
Grandma, it's not that fast.

331
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,610
Then you need to try harder.

332
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,800
Make it faster.

333
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,460
No, Grandma.

334
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,120
Why aren't you opening the braised food stall today?

335
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,570
Go back to take care of your business.

336
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,790
Right.

337
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,880
Since I don't know how to make him one of us,

338
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,030
I'll just become one of them first.

339
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,780
Hello, Grandma.

340
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,330
I'm Hei's girlfriend,

341
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,030
Bai.

342
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,590
What are you doing?

343
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,890
Grandma, I'm sorry.

344
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,890
I told Hei not to tell you.

345
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,280
Because I was worried you wouldn't accept me.

346
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,610
What are you doing?

347
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm being kind enough to help you out.

348
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,400
It's fine if you don't appreciate it,

349
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,500
but you pushed me away.

350
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,690
Help me out?

351
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,860
You're a man.

352
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,920
Do you have a better idea?

353
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,670
You're the one who lied.

354
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,490
I'm the only one in the house now.

355
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,780
Then just stay in your room.

356
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,920
You scared Grandma.

357
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,410
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,070
I scared Grandma because I'm a man.

359
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,210
Why don't you go to Dou Keyi Convenience House

360
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,650
to hire a girlfriend?

361
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,530
I forgot you're an employee of Dou Keyi Convenience House.

362
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,240
That way, Grandma would think we're...

363
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,150
That is wonderful.

364
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,770
If Grandma can't accept your boyfriend,

365
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,090
we'll just break up.

366
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,340
Wouldn't that be great?

367
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,650
Or...

368
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,000
you really have a girlfriend?

369
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
Then I should stay out of this.

370
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,640
Hey.

371
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,350
So...

372
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,580
you really have a girlfriend?

373
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,470
Or do you think I'm not good enough?

374
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,030
Then why won't you accept me?

375
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,780
Because I don't like lying.

376
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,310
What if...

377
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,990
it's a white lie?

378
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,170
What's wrong?

379
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,030
There is a cockroach.

380
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,480
Really?

381
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,400
Really.

382
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,710
Is it still there?

383
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,880
We can only get closer.

384
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,190
Is it still there?

385
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,600
Has it left?

386
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,870
Yes.

387
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,580
It has left.

388
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,660
So?

389
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm very useful.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,770
Why don't you consider making me your boyfriend?

391
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,110
Are we going to keep pretending

392
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,320
to be a couple from now on?

393
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,310
Is it convenient for you?

394
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,560
Now, we are...

395
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,060
on the same team?

396
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,160
I think the way you are now

397
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,220
is great.

398
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,980
Why did you get hurt?

399
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,900
Although I'm not that capable,

400
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,360
as long as you need me,

401
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
I'm here.

402
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,320
Go exchange the tie for lace.

403
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,580
What are you doing here?

404
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,960
I'll call the police!
