00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,980
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,080
Your kindness to me,

3
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,150
the days we spent together,

4
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,520
and those happy memories —

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,170
I don't know

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,330
which parts are real

7
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,430
and which parts are fake.

8
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,350
I only know that I've always been sincere.

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,460
Thank you for showing up.

10
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:34,009
(File 9: Everything is fake)

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,640
(Braised Food)

12
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,180
Don't eat spicy food if you can't.

13
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,210
I'm not like someone,

14
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,240
who had gastric perforation due to eating spicy food.

15
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,570
Bai

16
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,590
is Bai Zhouguo's younger brother.

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,720
You should've trained him before sending him here.

18
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,770
You planted an inexperienced person

19
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,300
around me.

20
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,200
What?

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,040
The Intelligence Bureau is training green hands?

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,170
Your fledgling

23
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:19,640
has been tagging along

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,380
behind my newbie all day long.

25
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,610
Does the convenience house

26
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,210
like to use such green rookies on missions now?

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
So, that Bai —

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,550
am I supposed

29
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,210
to deal with him or ignore him?

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,660
Then that Hei —

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,010
am I supposed to let him go

32
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,340
or should I bring him in?

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,770
Did you eat too much chili?

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,840
You're at peace sometimes,

35
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,900
and sometimes, you're against each other.

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,579
Excuse me.

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,530
Excuse me!

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,270
The worst thing is being confused

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,850
and unable to let go.

40
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,330
Just like pig's blood cakes —

41
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,860
if you stew them too long, they'll stick to the bottom of the pot.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,050
That smell...

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,140
Wait.

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,210
Wear this shirt.

45
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,930
I think something's wrong with the deal.

46
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,410
Be careful.

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,890
Bai Zhouqi, I order you to stay.

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,980
How dare you disobey me?

49
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,230
Don't go there. Do you hear me?

50
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,680
I can't do that.

51
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,360
Sorry, No Sir.

52
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,900
I told you he's my responsibility.

53
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,970
You go get the person you want.

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,740
I'll take care of my man.

55
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,740
Dou Keyi, not bad.

56
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,730
You're so confident.

57
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,600
You came alone.

58
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,670
So this is what Di meant.

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,860
Aren't you worried I might do something to you?

60
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,520
Or is there an ambush outside?

61
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,040
I'm so scared.

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,640
I'm so scared.

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,010
Who are you?

64
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
Where is Dou Keyi?

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
I came in his place today.

66
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,860
I thought I could get rid of Dou Keyi.

67
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,740
I didn't expect a pretty boy to show up and get himself killed.

68
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,160
And I paid for this.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,170
Can I get a refund now

70
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,640
or a discount?

71
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,380
It's okay.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,400
Give it to me.

73
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,910
(Two people are sharing locations)

74
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,380
Your boss sent you here to die.

75
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,290
I can spare your life.

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,340
Stop!

77
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,250
Stop!

78
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,170
Run!

79
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,820
Run!

80
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,590
Bai?

81
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,240
Bai.

82
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,750
Let's go.

83
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,070
Let's go to the hospital.

84
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,770
No.

85
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,100
The police will investigate you.

86
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,070
Why are you

87
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,280
here?

88
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,909
If

89
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,760
you know why I'm here,

90
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,240
will you forgive me?

91
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,909
(Hospital)

92
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,050
Hei Yubo.

93
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,430
Everything's arranged at the hospital.

94
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,160
The police won't come asking questions.

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,210
Go back and take good care of Bai.

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,950
It'll be over once he recovers.

97
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,350
Over?

98
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,150
What do you mean?

99
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,690
What's your relationship with Bai?

100
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm Bai Zhouqi's supervisor.

101
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,740
As for the rest,

102
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,130
think about it.

103
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,430
Or

104
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,490
ask him yourself.

105
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,770
Hei.

106
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,010
Hei.

107
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,480
Hei.

108
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,840
Hei!

109
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,789
Don't be afraid.

110
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,270
I'm here.

111
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,760
Hei.

112
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,470
Don't be afraid.

113
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm here.

114
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,390
Are you okay?

115
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,080
I'm fine.

116
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,000
The bad guys have been caught.

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
The doctor said you need a good rest.

118
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,060
Be good.

119
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,080
It won't hurt so much after you get some sleep.

120
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,720
This is the second time you got hurt for me.

121
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,390
This time,

122
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,730
did you happen to pass by again?

123
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,640
You're awake.

124
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,560
Nothing good happens when you run into me.

125
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,330
Last time, it was a knife wound.

126
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,990
This time, it's a gunshot wound.

127
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,100
I really...

128
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,840
This is called a sympathy ploy.

129
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,960
I can

130
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,160
take advantage of this

131
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,350
when you're angry in the future.

132
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,290
Nonsense.

133
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,060
Listen.

134
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,430
Don't do that again.

135
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,040
It's not very hot.

136
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,240
Here.

137
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,300
Slowly.

138
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,780
Why were you there yesterday?

139
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,450
(Professor)

140
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,050
Aren't you going to answer the call?

141
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,220
I'm tired.

142
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,110
Get some more sleep then.

143
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,510
It won't hurt so much after you fall asleep.

144
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,790
I didn't touch Hei Yubo.

145
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,550
I'll deal with you

146
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,100
after you deal with him.

147
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,290
I give you two options.

148
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,060
You come back, and I'll let him go.

149
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,330
Or

150
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,550
you stay with him,

151
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,310
and I'll investigate you both.

152
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,920
Why are you up?

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,310
Feeling unwell?

154
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,480
I have something to say.

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
It's late.

156
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,720
Let's talk tomorrow.

157
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,050
You asked me

158
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,450
why I was there yesterday.

159
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,370
I said let's talk tomorrow.

160
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:13,740
This...

161
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,270
is for wiretapping and tracking.

162
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,000
My mission

163
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,960
is to keep an eye on you.

164
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,480
What do you mean?

165
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,160
I was sent by the Intelligence Bureau

166
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,060
to work undercover around you.

167
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,850
I'm here to investigate Dou Keyi and the convenience house's

168
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,910
illegal dealings.

169
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,400
So...

170
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,420
So since the very beginning,

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,300
you've been with me

172
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
just to catch Mr. Dou?

173
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,950
You should've continued to lie.

174
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,070
Why are you telling me now?

175
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
I've been following you for so long,

176
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,730
only to find out you're of no use at all.

177
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,890
I don't want to waste any more time.

178
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,710
Then why did you save me from the knife and the bullet?

179
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,930
Why were you worried I'd be arrested for interrogations?

180
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,540
And what about this?

181
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,690
All of that was not because you love me,

182
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,750
but because they were your missions?

183
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,890
From beginning to end,

184
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,540
you've been an intelligence agent playing your part,

185
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,010
and I've been forced to play

186
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,470
the role of a fool who's been kept in the dark.

187
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,080
Thanks for the show.

188
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,300
Thank you

189
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,700
for making me believe this love foolishly.

190
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,490
Don't do this.

191
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,390
It's not like you.

192
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,920
Then what am I like?

193
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,220
Silly and cute?

194
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,590
Did you have fun watching?

195
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,400
You had to date your target

196
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
for your missions.

197
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,330
It must have been tough.

198
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,470
How do you want me to cooperate next?

199
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,440
Switch my side and help you catch Mr. Dou?

200
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,650
Or arrest me and imprison me?

201
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,910
Just tell me!

202
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,440
If you do this again,

203
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,670
what if you can't wear a ring in the future?

204
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,010
Then I'll do it after wearing a ring.

205
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,720
I won't take it off anyway.

206
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,390
Who's it from? You cherish it so much.

207
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,590
I'm waiting for you to give me one.

208
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,830
How did you feel

209
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,170
when you did all that?

210
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,140
Ridiculous

211
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,750
or pathetic?

212
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,060
That thing is fake.

214
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,020
No big deal. It's fine.

215
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,640
Also,

216
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,940
Bai was actually sent by...

217
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,690
the Intelligence Bureau.

218
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,310
The whole game

219
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,600
was just a mutual test

220
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,860
between me and the Intelligence Bureau.

221
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,590
You and Bai

222
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,570
were like this crispy chicken wing,

223
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,140
a dish served

224
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,240
with the wine.

225
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,680
So...

226
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,520
you knew everything from the beginning?

227
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,710
Do you know why

228
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,750
I only asked you to do trivial things

229
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,800
like walking dogs and looking for cats?

230
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,670
Once

231
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,370
you enter this industry,

232
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,390
no matter how careful you are,

233
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,180
your shoes will get wet.

234
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,220
Once your shoes get wet and dirty,

235
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,890
no one would

236
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,020
care about what they used to look like.

237
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,610
I won't trouble you with the convenience house's things anymore.

238
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,470
But the Bai family has been intelligence agents for generations.

239
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,570
Bai Gangzheng

240
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,440
might come and force you and Bai to cut ties.

241
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,610
Prepare for it.

242
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,850
It won't be necessary.

243
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,300
Even our love was fake.

244
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,790
I was just his target.

245
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,840
Fake?

246
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,960
Then why

247
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,460
are you sitting here unharmed?

248
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,120
Why is Bai the one who got hurt?

249
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,840
I don't agree with you two being together.

250
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,280
After all, the Bai family is too crafty.

251
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,040
It'll be hard for both of you.

252
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,460
Maybe he doesn't care at all.

253
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,400
Maybe he's dying to break free from me.

254
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,040
People lie,

255
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,590
but their eyes don't.

256
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,190
Think about

257
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,520
the way he looked at you.

258
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,690
So never

259
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,620
lose yourself

260
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,680
or misjudge others because of anger.

261
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,960
Hei.

262
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,500
Hei!

263
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,120
Hei.

264
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,360
Hei.

265
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,520
Hei!

266
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,250
Hei!

267
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,330
I admit

268
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,910
at first, I approached you with a purpose.

269
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,700
But I don't know when

270
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,050
I started to hate who I am

271
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,200
after seeing you work

272
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,880
so hard for Grandma and Jiali.

273
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,400
So,

274
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,800
I wanted to help you finish your missions quickly

275
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,100
and end everything.

276
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,160
But...

277
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,710
I somehow fell in love with you.

278
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,040
I wanted to tell you the truth many times.

279
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,610
But I knew

280
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,370
as long as I said it,

281
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,120
it would all be over between us.

282
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,670
Don't you want me anymore?

283
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,180
You're such a nice person.

284
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,180
You're supposed to say,

285
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,210
"I forgive you,"

286
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,410
or "It's okay,

287
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,810
we'll figure it out together."

288
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,400
Or at least wait until I recover.

289
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,930
And I didn't mean to say that.

290
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,770
I just didn't want you to be investigated.

291
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,450
Hei.

292
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,380
(Pay rent on the 15th day)

293
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,870
(Have a birthday feast on May 26)

294
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,700
(Reminder: utilities must be paid today)

295
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,000
(Have a birthday feast on May 26)

296
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:05,980
Wait a little longer.

297
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,070
(Preview)
Wait a little longer.

298
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,000
At least let me say...
(Preview)

299
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,490
Do you think he still wants to talk to you?
(Preview)

300
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,610
From the very beginning, you two were destined to stand on opposite sides.

301
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,120
If my presence is a burden to him,

302
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,820
is it better to let go

303
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,400
no matter how much I love him?

304
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,600
Hei.

305
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,830
Tell me,

306
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,190
what are these?

307
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,540
Was it for your mission?

308
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,340
I didn't complete the mission.

309
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,450
Because I fell in love with him.

310
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,470
What did you say?

311
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,530
What did you say?

312
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,250
I want to be the one who protects Bai

313
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,880
and shoulder everything for him.
