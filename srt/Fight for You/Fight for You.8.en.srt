1
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,019
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,730
I lie every day.

3
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,470
For justice,

4
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,210
I fabricate identities.

5
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,600
For missions,

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,610
I concoct lies.

7
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,039
But there's a kind of lie

8
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,780
that I tell to protect the person I love.

9
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,410
(File 8: Lying Is My Way of Protecting You)

10
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,979
Prepare yourself for this.

11
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,020
I'm actually an intelligence agent

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,190
tasked with following and monitoring you.

13
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,760
The goal is to eliminate Dou Keyi

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,060
and his convenience house.

15
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,830
Our encounter wasn't a coincidence.

16
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,460
All the coincidences were not accidental.

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,590
They were all meticulously arranged.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,460
But my feelings for you...

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,840
Between us...

20
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,750
Falling asleep at this kind of timing?

21
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,560
I finally mustered up my courage.

22
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,310
You must report all the information

23
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,970
to the higher-ups from now on.

24
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,050
This is your last chance.

25
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,530
Staying by his side,

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,390
at least I can find a chance

27
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,590
to help him get away as soon as possible.

28
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,420
If someone else were to follow and monitor him,

29
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,260
Hei would really get caught.

30
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,510
Bai.

31
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,980
This thing on my ear...

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,079
Did you put it on me?

33
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,840
It looks great on you.

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,090
It's just I've never worn this before,
so I'm a bit not used to it.

35
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,550
You'll get used to it if you wear it every day.

36
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,170
Well, it's all because someone said

37
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,570
he felt insecure since I didn't rely on him.

38
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,400
So I specially chose a couple gift

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,730
to express my feelings.

40
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,340
Forget it if you don't want to wear it.

41
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,400
Give it back to me.

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,260
Since it's a gift to me, it's mine now.

43
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,380
These are matching cartilage earrings.

44
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,580
Don't you take it off.

45
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,950
Okay.

46
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,520
I want to give you a gift too.

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
Can I choose?

48
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,800
You have something you want?

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,190
No matter what it is,

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,350
you'll give it to me?

51
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,350
As long as it's something you want,

52
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,080
I'll find a way to give it to you.

53
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,980
I want a wish.

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,840
A wish?

55
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,600
I'll save it for now and tell you later.

56
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,880
I see.

57
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,940
Are you going somewhere?

58
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,120
Yes, to the convenience house.

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,220
What about you?

60
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm stuck on my thesis.

61
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,800
I need to stay at home and work on it.

62
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,030
Be good and work hard.

63
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,230
By the way,

64
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
I took that cold remedy yesterday

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,620
and it made me drowsy.

66
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,480
Did you have something to tell me?

67
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,450
Hold on.

68
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,880
Hello?

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,270
Really?

70
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,360
Okay, thank you.

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,890
What is it?

72
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,520
It was the hospital,

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,140
saying there's a chance for
Jiali's heart surgery.

74
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,640
They want me to come over for
a face-to-face meeting.

75
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,540
Really?

76
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,340
That's great.

77
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,940
What did you want to say to me just now?

78
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,040
It was nothing.

79
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,680
I'll go to the hospital with you.

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,480
No need. Just focus on writing
your thesis at home.

81
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,930
Okay then.

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,790
See you later.

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,270
Okay, bye.

84
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,410
Yubo, why are you here?

85
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,970
The doctor wants to see you?

86
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,750
Your gift, pretty girl.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,080
Bai didn't come with you?

88
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,290
Bai?

89
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,640
You should call him Brother, okay?

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,070
He's busy today.

91
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,860
What?

92
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,580
You prefer him to come?

93
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,930
You've been talking about him since I came.

94
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,070
I'm the one who treats you better, okay?

95
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,200
So ungrateful.

96
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,870
I thought you broke up.

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,440
After all, you have no sense of romance.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,310
Then get better soon to get discharged, so you can
keep an eye on us yourself.

99
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,210
I've improved a lot.

100
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,270
I may not be able to get discharged.

101
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,660
A couple of days ago, I dreamed that I died.

102
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,320
Hey.

103
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,380
What kind of nonsense was that?

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,900
Listen to me.

105
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,200
The doctor said your condition is fine,

106
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,130
and the surgery can be scheduled
in the next few days.

107
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,080
The medical field is very advanced now.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
They say there's a method where

109
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,940
an artificial valve can be implanted
using a catheter.

110
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,550
And after a short rest,

111
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,880
you'll be able to get discharged in a week.

112
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,950
Don't be afraid.

113
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,170
The wound will only be 1 cm long,

114
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,430
and the surgery will only take two hours.

115
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
How much is it?

116
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,390
I've heard the doctors talk about it.

117
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,400
Yubo.

118
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,630
Where will you get the money?

119
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,270
Don't worry about that.

120
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,540
Are you going to sell yourself again?

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,150
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,020
Every time you come to see me,

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,950
you're always covered in bruises.

124
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,510
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

125
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,130
These minor injuries are nothing.

126
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,730
You always say it's nothing.

127
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,630
These are all

128
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,730
out-of-pocket expenses.

129
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,690
If you do something bad for me,

130
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,350
then I'd rather not have the surgery.

131
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,049
Hei Jiali!

132
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,740
How much money have you spent on me
since childhood?

133
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,900
It's not like I'm ever going to recover.

134
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,090
I might as well just die.

135
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,300
Are you really not going to do the surgery?

136
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,300
No.

137
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,780
I don't want treatment.

138
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,140
(Grandma)

139
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,790
Then speak to Grandma yourself.

140
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,830
Tell her you're actually in the hospital,
not abroad,

141
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,160
and you'd rather die than ask her for help.

142
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,340
If Grandma found out about this,
how heartbroken would she be?

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,860
You know how much I love you.

144
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,250
Do you really want to make me worry?

145
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,160
Be brave.

146
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,140
Money can be earned again,

147
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,350
but I only have one sister.

148
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,130
(Bai, keep an eye on silly Hei for me!)
(My surgery requires a lot of money. I'm worried he's going to do something foolish again.)

149
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,320
We recommend that your sister undergo
a catheter-based

150
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,700
artificial aortic valve implantation.

151
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,830
We suggest using a durable biological valve

152
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,100
to reduce the use of anticoagulants.

153
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,630
Regarding the items that require
out-of-pocket expenses,

154
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,960
as her family, we need your confirmation.

155
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,190
Di.

156
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,070
I need more work.

157
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,650
Didn't I already give you some?

158
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,670
Alright then, I'll add some more.

159
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,740
Happy?

160
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,140
What now?

161
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,120
The recent quests have all...

162
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,310
They've all been too simple.

163
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,930
Simple?

164
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,600
You know, I haven't even settled the score

165
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,510
with you for failing the mission last time

166
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,620
because of your relationship.

167
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,520
Do you know what I had to do to complete
that mission later?

168
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,460
I even...

169
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,610
It was my fault last time.

170
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,720
Forget it.

172
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,610
My expectations of you were too high.

173
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,170
It's better for us to count on
ourselves out here.

174
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,970
Di.

175
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,800
I promise I won't make any more mistakes.

176
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,670
Promise?

177
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,280
How can you guarantee that?

178
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,550
You might as well ask me instead of him.

179
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,640
You two seem to be really idle, huh?

180
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,340
How's Jiali been doing lately?

181
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,510
She's fine.

182
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,740
You're even lying to me now?

183
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,140
I've asked the hospital.

184
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,490
Why would they tell you?

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,490
How much more do you need?
I'll transfer it to you.

186
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,770
Mr. Dou.

187
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,180
He hasn't even paid off his previous debt,

188
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,510
and now he's asking for an even bigger sum.

189
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,270
Did he ask?

190
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm the one who asked, right?

191
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,340
You always protect him.

192
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,860
Remember to give me your account number.

193
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,470
Mr. Dou.

194
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,290
I can't take your money anymore.

195
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,790
Just think of it as me buying
a car for Jiali, alright?

196
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,930
I've had you work here and
advance your salary.

197
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,260
All I do is buy flowers, act as a purchasing agent,
and walk cats and dogs.

198
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
How much of this do you think I need to do
to pay off my debt?

199
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,920
Mr. Dou.

200
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,750
Are you taking pity on me?

201
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,620
I only take money for work.

202
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,130
Or I'll figure something else out myself.

203
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,780
Alright.

204
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,680
I heard you.

205
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Go back first.

206
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,080
Don't think I don't know what kind of job

207
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,410
you were planning to give him.

208
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,810
Being all presumptuous.

209
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,800
It's not like that, Mr. Dou.

210
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,050
Didn't you say Bai

211
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,520
works for Bu Xing?

212
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,120
I thought I'd send Hei to confuse them.

213
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,790
Who would have known he was so clueless?

214
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,250
He didn't even realize he was being watched.

215
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,600
He's not cut out for this line of work.

216
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,000
Don't drag him into this.

217
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,220
Are you still mad at me, Jiali?

218
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,640
Alright.

219
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,590
I promise you.

220
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,550
I'll be good.

221
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,050
Jiali is worried about you.

222
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,750
Alright, I admit it.

223
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
Jiali told me

224
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,320
about your fight.

225
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,140
She complained to you?

226
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,280
You talked to her on my behalf, right?

227
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,140
This time,

228
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,580
I'm on Jiali's side.

229
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,120
Let me ask you.

230
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,490
Why did you move out to live alone

231
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,410
after arranging for Jiali to be hospitalized?

232
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,730
It was because to save Jiali,

233
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,670
you might have to take risks,

234
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,550
and you didn't want Grandma to worry,

235
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,250
right?

236
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,800
What are you trying to say?

237
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,470
Have you ever considered the feelings
of the people around you?

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,610
Your grandma, who doesn't know

239
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,450
what he grandson does out there;

240
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,640
your sister, who always sees her brother

241
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,910
covered in bruises during hospital visits;

242
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,670
and

243
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,820
me, who's always been by your side.

244
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,000
We're all worried about you.

245
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,839
Don't worry.

246
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,400
Look at me. I'm so tall.

247
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,230
I'm tough and resilient.

248
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,290
Physical injuries are nothing.

249
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,940
I can share it with you.

250
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,210
I have a suggestion.

251
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,300
Jiali is like my own sister.

252
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,640
We're so close anyway,

253
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,340
so how about you let me cover
this medical expense first?

254
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,820
I'm doing this

255
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,250
out of selfish thoughts.

256
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,080
I want you to focus on our relationship.

257
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,630
You can take your time to pay me back.

258
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,420
I appreciate your kindness.

259
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,910
Why are you rejecting me?

260
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,880
Because I don't want my own matters

261
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,480
to affect our relationship.

262
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,450
Are you really going to

263
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,860
make me watch you worry?

264
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,380
You don't need to worry.

265
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,980
This matter has been solved.

266
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,960
How?

267
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,460
Mr. Dou will arrange work for me.

268
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,510
You mean the convenience house?

269
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
You call that work?

270
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,670
You do whatever they tell you to do,

271
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,400
going there blindly without
knowing anything.

272
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,650
Even when there's danger,
you can't avoid it.

273
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,810
This is my choice.

274
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,250
Can't you respect me?

275
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,070
Do you know how stupid this is?

276
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,470
Making such a dangerous decision

277
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,170
for your ridiculous pride.

278
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,810
Your family is my family.

279
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,040
Why can't you let me help you?

280
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,430
Why draw such a hard line between us?

281
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,800
Then why don't you want to

282
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
introduce your family to me?

283
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Are you worried they won't approve of me
as I am now?

284
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,440
My ridiculous pride?

285
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,080
This is the only thing left

286
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,210
that's been supporting me to this day.

287
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm not like you,

288
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,560
who grew up in a privileged environment,

289
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,100
living in an ivory tower,

290
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,250
unaware of the hardships of the world.

291
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,380
You don't know me at all!

292
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,660
Right.

293
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,980
Come to think of it,

294
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,160
I've told you everything about me,

295
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,230
but I don't know you at all.

296
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,110
Hei.

297
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
It seems we won't reach a consensus.

298
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,010
You promised me a wish.

299
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,430
Don't get involved with the convenience
house anymore.

300
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,510
If you still want to be with me,

301
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,040
then don't go.

302
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,720
I don't understand.

303
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,860
You've always been so supportive.

304
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,480
Why are you suddenly insisting that I quit now?

305
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,530
What kind of work pays enough to
cover an entire surgery bill?

306
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,320
You'd have to risk your life for that,
wouldn't you?

307
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,550
Okay.

308
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,970
I promise you.

309
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,090
I won't let anything happen to me.

310
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,690
But don't misuse your wish.

311
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,470
Next time, make another wish

312
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,780
on something that can make yourself happy.

313
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
Just don't put yourself in danger,
and I'll be happy.

314
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,180
This is your last chance.

315
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,540
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,260
I said something harsh yesterday,

317
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,430
but I know you meant well.

318
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,910
Hei.

319
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,010
Think about Grandma and Jiali.

320
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,360
Don't make one mistake after another

321
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
and get involved deeper and deeper.

322
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,470
Let's talk when I'm back.

323
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,500
After I come back, I'll listen to you on everything,

324
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,230
okay?

325
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,950
Where are you going?

326
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,860
To find Di.

327
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,830
That Shi again?

328
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,790
I'll go with you.

329
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,080
After the seduction plan failed last time,

330
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,130
he still gets a bit angry whenever
I bring you up.

331
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,440
I'll be right back.

332
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,410
Okay. Got it.

333
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,800
By the way, can you do me a favor?

334
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,290
What is it?

335
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,590
Jiali is still mad at me.

336
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,290
Can you go to the hospital and keep
her company for me?

337
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,590
And...

338
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,780
And put in a good word for her brother,

339
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,550
right?

340
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,040
Yes.

341
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:19,930
What's your relationship with Bai?

342
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,230
(Preview)
What's your relationship with Bai?

343
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,300
(Preview)

344
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,770
I'm Bai Zhouqi's supervisor.
(Preview)

345
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,340
I've been following you for so long,

346
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,950
only to find out you're of no use at all.

347
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,510
So all of this was not because you like me,

348
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,110
and it was all just a mission?

349
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,920
What were you feeling

350
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,780
when you did all this?

351
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,030
They fell in love pretty fast,

352
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,730
but they turned against each other
just as quickly.

353
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,630
Hei!

354
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,800
So confident as to dare come alone?

355
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,480
Aren't you worried I might do something
to you?
