1
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,959
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,060
We're all pretending.

3
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,250
No one can predict

4
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,090
when the pretense will become reality.

5
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,600
Don't be stubborn,

6
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,070
thinking you are definitely clear-headed

7
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,039
and fully aware.

8
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,830
(File 5: After All This Acting, What's Real and What's Fake?)

9
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,770
That day, you said our relationship

10
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,650
had started to change.

11
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,430
How?

12
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,530
Although we're not a real couple,

13
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,100
we live together,

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,900
we've kissed,

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,170
and we've gone through hardships together.

16
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,900
That changed our relationship, don't you think?

17
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,900
Why are you backing away from me?

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,390
Why are you leaning in so close?

19
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,630
What do you expect me to do?

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,780
The chicken feet are sold out today.

21
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,980
I'll give you some for free next time.

22
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,680
Okay, no problem.

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,910
Remember to remind me.

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,380
Okay.

25
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,570
Let's go home.

26
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:00,930
Alright.

27
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,980
As a man,

28
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,380
I won't hold you responsible for a kiss

29
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,910
and my injuries.

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,980
Grandma likes you so much.

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,480
When the time comes for us to tell her we're breaking up,

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,010
I'm sure she'll be very sad.

33
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,590
This is why I don't like lying.

34
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,460
Because you have to use more lies to cover it up.

35
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,790
Which part is real,

36
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,050
and which part is fake?

37
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,829
Once the convenience house matters are settled

38
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,200
and my sister's surgery goes smoothly,

39
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,530
everything will go back to normal, right?

40
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,680
Bai?

41
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,770
What's wrong?

42
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,050
Got a new mission?

43
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,590
Yes.

44
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,960
We told Grandma that

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,770
we'd experience life together, didn't we?

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,600
If there's a mission, let's do it together.

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,530
It'll be faster.

48
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,960
What kind of mission is it?

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,930
Manual labor?

50
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,300
Kind of.

51
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,770
But also... Kind of not.

52
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,370
Seduction?

53
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,010
Stop laughing.

54
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,910
Can you do it?

55
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,550
I really can't.

56
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,850
I understand.

57
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,880
You got all flustered after kissing me once,

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,610
let alone seduction.

59
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,950
Bai Zhouqi.

60
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,360
Don't be sarcastic.

61
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,089
Don't worry.

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,560
Leave it to me.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
You take care of the physical part,

64
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,300
and I take care of the soul.

65
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,940
Don't think too much.

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,400
It must be because you're handsome

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
that you got selected for this mission.

68
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,540
Will the convenience house reimburse you if you buy clothes?

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,710
Is the size okay?

70
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,370
Yes.

71
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,700
Let me adjust it for you.

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,900
Is it too tight?

73
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,000
Pardon me.

74
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,010
Pardon me.

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:21,950
Also,

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,940
during the date,

77
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,400
remember not to take her on your motorcycle.

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,070
Your mission target likes working out?

79
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,880
That's almost like having home-court advantage, isn't it?

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,730
Check out that guy.

81
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,990
He's so handsome and charming.

82
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,080
Attracting so much attention.

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
Guess you don't need my teaching.

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,360
What was that? I didn't hear you.

85
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,740
(Taste on the Tip of the Tongue)

86
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,810
Here are your dishes.
(Taste on the Tip of the Tongue)

87
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,010
-Here.
-Thank you.

88
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,190
Sorry that

89
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,490
I can only afford to treat you to these.

90
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,360
It's okay.

91
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,750
All food is just calories anyway.

92
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,730
Here.

93
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,159
Thank you.

94
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,250
You're actually very considerate.

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,540
Maybe I'm just used to taking care of my little sister since childhood.

96
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,800
How old is your sister?

97
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,420
She's in high school.

98
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,670
But she's been on leave for six months.

99
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,110
When she was born,

100
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,040
our father died due to an accident.

101
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,320
Two years later, our mother passed

102
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
from a heart attack, too.

103
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,850
Later, when she was diagnosed

104
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,050
with heart problems,

105
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,990
she kept asking

106
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,860
if she would become an angel

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,890
like our mother.

108
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,830
You know what?

109
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,900
Grandma was so scared that she cried for a long time back then.

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,500
So when my sister underwent surgery this time,

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,100
I dared not let her know.

112
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,460
So that's why you lied to Grandma that your sister's abroad?

113
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,340
You know what?

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,580
Hei Jiali is very smart.

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
Although her health is poor,

116
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,780
she always teases me,

117
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,520
saying that I only grow in height,

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,380
while she grows in intelligence.

119
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,620
When you visit Jiali next time,

120
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,760
can I go with you?

121
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,850
But you don't know her.

122
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,670
She has to meet her brother's boyfriend eventually.

123
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,370
(Taste on the Tip of the Tongue)

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:50,930
Hey.
(Taste on the Tip of the Tongue)

125
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,820
If you keep doing this,

126
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,990
I'll take it seriously.

127
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,050
(Taste on the Tip of the Tongue)

128
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,330
Bai.

129
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,750
Those who know are as guilty as those who commit the crime.

130
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,080
Don't be soft-hearted.

131
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,590
Well, how about we have a serious discussion

132
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,490
about your seduction plan?

133
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,600
Let's finish eating first.

134
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,240
Come on. Eat.

135
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,350
The first step of seduction is crucial.

136
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,090
But I really can't do it.

137
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,240
No buts.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,840
Don't you want to

139
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,170
repay Mr. Dou's favor as soon as possible?

140
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,409
Only after you repay his favor

141
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,850
can I complete my mission

142
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,980
and get out of here as soon as possible.

143
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,720
From now on,

144
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,990
we're 100% on the same side.

145
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,010
Come on.

146
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,030
I'll start with

147
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,100
the teaching of flirting, which is the most important part.

148
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,060
The first step is always the hardest.

149
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,230
The first contact with your mission target

150
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,610
is especially important.

151
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,610
Success or failure will be determined at first sight.

152
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,700
(Flirting: Take 1)

153
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,840
The target is a 22-year-old woman

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,070
who likes shopping.

155
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,070
Seize the "six-second first sight" attraction rule.

156
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,040
Baby.

157
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,020
Are you addicted to kissing?

158
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,250
I didn't mean it.

159
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,090
Be more serious.

160
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,020
I haven't even got to the point yet.

161
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,930
Alright.

162
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,590
But can you please

163
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,850
stay away from my ears?

164
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,370
What?

165
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
Is that your sensitive spot?

166
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,540
Alright.

167
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,960
I won't touch your ears.

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,900
But don't you kiss me sneakily again.

169
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,770
Turn around.

170
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,360
Come on.

171
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,260
(Flirting: Take 2)

172
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,230
Baby.

173
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,550
Sir, you got the wrong person.

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,900
I did.

175
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,200
That's because

176
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:05,630
she

177
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,340
cannot compare to you.

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,950
Wait.

179
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,950
How could you possibly succeed

180
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,150
with this kind of flirting technique?

181
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,550
Who did you learn it from?

182
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,760
Isn't this what the performance training course

183
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,820
at the Intelligence Bureau teaches?

184
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,850
How can you complete the mission

185
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,310
if you keep holding yourself back like this?

186
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,040
I can't drink.

187
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,190
A little of this and I'll be drunk.

188
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,190
You'll get drunk,

189
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,410
but you'll remember what happens,

190
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:10,940
right?

191
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,870
It's just a soda.

192
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,410
I can handle a soda.

193
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll go get you a towel.

194
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,910
Where are you going?

195
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,980
I want to take care of you.

196
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,410
Bass soup.

197
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,940
You should go take a shower.

198
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
You're more relaxed when you're drunk.

199
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,800
So, have a drink to boost your courage.

200
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,620
But you need to remember how you feel.

201
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,880
(Flirting: Take 3)

202
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,010
Baby.

203
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,250
You got the wrong person.

204
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,590
No, I didn't.

205
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,810
It's you.

206
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,870
Do you want to continue?

207
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,460
Enough!

208
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,140
No need to continue.

209
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,130
Does this wine

210
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,450
have aphrodisiac effects,

211
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,580
or are you pretending to be innocent to get what you want?

212
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,510
You should sober up.

213
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,910
I'll go use the bathroom.

214
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,700
If No Sir knows about this,

215
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,450
he'll definitely send me back for retraining.

216
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,830
Why am I so easily affected?

217
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,740
Baby.

218
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,090
What in the world is Hei Yubo's problem?

219
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,640
Did he do it on purpose or not?

220
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,590
You're quite well-behaved when you're drunk.

221
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,690
I believe you didn't do it on purpose.

222
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,210
Sleeping like this.

223
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,660
How can you navigate this world

224
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,350
with such a lack of vigilance?

225
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,810
You better

226
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,600
not get caught.

227
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,510
One more time.

228
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,460
Why did you suddenly get up?

229
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,330
Or should I have informed anyone beforehand?

230
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,300
I should be asking you.

231
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,700
Why were you leaning on top of me like a ghost?

232
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,270
I came to call you down for breakfast,

233
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,330
and I saw your mouth moving.

234
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,150
I... I was just curious.

235
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,060
Curious?

236
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:23,910
Curious?

237
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,650
Curious?

238
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,310
Why should you be curious?

239
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,880
Don't you drink again from now on.

240
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,980
I drink?

241
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,620
It was you who asked me to drink.

242
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,450
You know very well I can't hold my liquor.

243
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,120
Fine.

244
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,020
Are you blaming me now?

245
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,060
Why are you so badly-behaved when you're drunk?

246
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,560
You just kiss around when you're drunk, right?

247
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,460
Tell me.

248
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,630
How many people did you kiss

249
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,360
before you confirmed you can't hold your liquor?

250
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,100
It's not like that.

251
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,370
You're the only one.

252
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,350
The first time you kissed me, it was an act in front of Grandma.

253
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,480
The second time was for the mission.

254
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,849
If you kiss me the third time,

255
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,619
does that mean...

256
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,150
The dishes are getting cold. Come out and eat.

257
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
He's really different when he's drunk.

258
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,060
It feels like he's suddenly turned into a CEO from a student.

259
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,319
Wait for me.

260
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
You look so similar to my boyfriend...

261
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,690
She has a necklace on her which was given to her by her boyfriend.

262
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,610
Once you get it,

263
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,430
the mission will be completed.

264
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,100
Does he even need to seduce her?

265
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,620
Why do they have to get so close?

266
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,560
(Find a way to switch that thing Hei Yubo got and take it back.)

267
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,360
Besides me, did No Sir send

268
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,060
someone else to watch Hei as well?

269
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
Or has someone in the convenience house

270
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,170
been tipping him off?

271
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,140
No Sir should know that business matters cannot be overstepped, right?

272
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,070
I'm in charge of Hei's matters.

273
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,480
(Where are you going now?)
(Watching a movie.)
(When are you coming back?)
(Did it go well?)
(Where are you?)

274
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,740
(Hei)

275
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,380
Why hasn't he read my messages?

276
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,260
He's not caught, is he?

277
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,700
If he gets caught, as his supervisor,

278
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,130
I should be notified.

279
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,040
Are you waiting here for me to come home?

280
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,300
Who's waiting for you?

281
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,010
I just came back.

282
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,170
I texted you just now

283
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,620
to see if you wanted to have dinner together.

284
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,820
Why didn't you reply?

285
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,650
Did the mission go well?

286
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,460
That woman asked me

287
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
not to be distracted during the date,

288
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,790
so she snatched my phone and turned it off.

289
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,000
So you went for dinner after the movie?

290
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,370
What did you have?

291
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,070
Some French cuisine.

292
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,680
We waited forever for the food and I didn't even get full.

293
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm so hungry.

294
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,710
Hold on.

295
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
Hello, matron?

296
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
What trouble did my sister cause this time?

297
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,720
Okay.

298
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,850
I'll be right there.

299
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,030
What happened?

300
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,260
It's my sister.

301
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,760
Let's go. I'll go with you.

302
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,780
(Room 2) (Room 3)

303
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,280
You said you didn't eat enough for dinner.

304
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,990
I know you're allergic to milk.

305
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,590
You can have soy milk, right?

306
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,060
At least drink some.

307
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,340
The doctor said

308
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,210
she'll be fine.

309
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,910
Do you want to lean on me for a while?

310
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,980
It's getting late.

311
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,570
You should go back first.

312
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,960
I slept all day today.

313
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,490
I'm very energetic now.

314
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Or

315
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,560
am I bothering you by being here?

316
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,140
Didn't you say last time that

317
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,900
you're allergic to the hospital's disinfectant,

318
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,700
and you'll faint if you smell it?

319
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,840
You remember it quite clearly.

320
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,070
But in order to keep my boyfriend company,

321
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm okay with it.

322
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,040
Come on.

323
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,400
Close your eyes and get some sleep.

324
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,050
Hei, if you have dark circles

325
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,290
and look pale tomorrow,

326
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,740
your pretty little girl will be worried.

327
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,350
Go to sleep.

328
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,870
I'm really scared.

329
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,980
She still has a lot of things she wants to do.

330
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,220
Every time she saw me,

331
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,190
she'd tell me

332
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,430
what she wanted to do after she was discharged.

333
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,830
It's been a long time since she last played the claw machine.

334
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,110
But I can't help her with anything.

335
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
Who said that?

336
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,220
You are her bravest brother.

337
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,780
You're tough and strong.

338
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,490
There aren't many people like you in this world.

339
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,430
Moreover,

340
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,100
she's going to meet

341
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,300
the best match for her brother, his boyfriend, tomorrow.

342
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,840
Do you think

343
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,440
Jiali will be able to tell

344
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,370
whether we're a real couple or not?

345
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,050
How about

346
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,920
I sing you a song?

347
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,460
♫Open the door, little rabbit♫

348
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,370
♫Open it♫

349
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,070
♫I want to come in♫

350
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,170
♫No, I won't open it♫

351
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,150
What's your intention in approaching my brother?

352
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,270
(Preview)
What's your intention in approaching my brother?

354
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,570
He's not rich.

356

It's not because you covet his body, is it?

357
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,360
It's not because you covet his body, is it?

358
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,640
You're so good at it.

359
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,870
Let me see if that woman

360
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,510
will be so impressed by your handsome face that she doesn't want to leave.

361
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,310
Kiss me.

362
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,760
I'm jealous.

363
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,610
Then...

364
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,910
What about when you're with me?

365
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,670
Everything feels right when I'm with you.

366
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,420
If you kiss me again,

367
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,090
I'll take it seriously.
