1
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,030
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,530
Good and evil are no longer absolute.

3
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,270
Black and white no longer
stand in opposition.

4
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,420
Our story goes on.

5
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,690
What about ours?

6
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,230
As time goes by, some people drift apart.

7
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,030
Some people are still together.

8
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,930
(File 12: The future is the days
with you by my side)

9
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,670
Should we start saving money

10
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,840
to buy this house?

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,229
Yes.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,610
I didn't expect your grandma
to know my grandpa.

13
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,580
Mm.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,960
You didn't know

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,490
your grandma is Black Rose?

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,970
Grandma never talked much about her past.

17
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,660
I only know
Mr. Dou respects Grandma very much.

18
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,970
I heard from my relatives

19
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,310
that she was extraordinary in her youth.

20
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,000
After my parents passed away,

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,110
she poured all her energy

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,880
into raising me and my sister.

23
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,530
Luckily, we have her.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,260
Otherwise, with Grandpa's

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
cold heart, who knows

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,950
how long you'd have had to kneel?

27
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,590
I remember how much it hurt

28
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,620
when Grandma hit me with the ladle.

29
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,790
It hurt that much? Let me see.

30
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,230
Didn't you think I was dirty and smelly?

31
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,810
No matter how dirty and smelly you are,

32
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,110
you're still mine.

33
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,030
You...

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
Go take a shower first.

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,800
Get off then.

36
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,650
No.

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,790
Then help me.

38
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,680
Let's go.

39
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,000
Bai.

40
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,520
The doctor said Jiali's surgery went well.

41
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,850
She'll be able to leave the hospital soon.

42
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,550
Really?

43
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,170
Yes.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,230
That's great.

45
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,940
Jiali can finally be discharged.

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,300
Hei!

47
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,490
Hei!

48
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm free!

49
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,090
Free?

50
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,670
Yes.

51
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,420
During his training period,
Bai Zhouqi performed poorly

52
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,650
and repeatedly disobeyed orders.

53
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,700
Following the review by senior officers,

54
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,760
it's been decided
he would be dismissed from training.

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Who gets dismissed from training
and still looks this happy?

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,300
Didn't Grandpa say anything?

57
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,360
Grandpa put on a show—

58
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,260
accusing me of being unfilial.

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,640
They all said Advisor Bai
placed righteousness above family loyalty.

60
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,960
You did so much

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,090
just to become an intelligence agent.

62
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,770
You disobeyed orders

63
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,100
because of me.

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,260
You don't regret it?

65
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,510
In the past, everything I did

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,850
was for Grandpa.

67
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,880
But now I have you.

68
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,700
I don't need to be someone else.

69
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,470
I know

70
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,490
you like me just the way I am.

71
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,220
Right?

72
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,320
It's always you and me.

73
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,170
Your name means no, but my name means yes.

74
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,100
We always end up together somehow.

75
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,440
This is the first time in years
you came to me first.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,900
You've got nothing to say?

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,740
Hei Yubo and Bai taught me a lesson.

78
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,780
Seeing them

79
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,950
makes me think of how we used to be.

80
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,640
If I had trusted you more back then,

81
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,780
maybe things wouldn't

82
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,380
be like this now.

83
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,350
I've also been thinking

84
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,850
if there had been
another choice back then,

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,090
maybe we'd still be

86
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,990
walking the same path now.

87
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,960
But all I can do is thinking about it.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,490
What's done

89
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,290
can't be undone.

90
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,320
Someone asked me

91
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,720
if that day,

92
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,390
it had been you

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,650
instead of Hei Yubo,

94
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,030
would I let them pull the trigger?

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,900
You?

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,150
You definitely would.

97
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,800
Intelligence agents
must be loyal and selfless.

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,409
They must never
bend the law for personal gain.

99
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,190
As the chief,

100
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,240
I should set an example.

101
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,840
So today,

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
you came to arrest me?

103
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
No.

104
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,640
I came to admit I failed in my duty.

105
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,880
I've been after you for so many years,

106
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,630
but I could never
bring myself to arrest you.

107
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,470
You don't look like a bad person.

108
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,320
You don't look like a cop.

109
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,220
From now on, I'll withdraw
from the pursuit of you.

110
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,460
I've also decided to take a break.

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,500
I might never come back.

112
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,260
What about the convenience house?

113
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,380
Close it.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,250
Can you really let it go?

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,520
The game of cops and thieves—

116
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,870
it's no fun

117
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,110
with only one side playing.

118
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,060
What a coincidence.

119
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,890
I'm here to buy braised food.

120
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,960
Since Grandma isn't here,

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
I'll leave.

122
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,670
Bye bye.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
Bai Zhouguo.

124
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,570
Sit.

125
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,290
Sit.

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,830
From now on, I hope the Bai family

127
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,170
can take good care of Hei.

128
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,060
I...

129
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,610
I really am not stalking you.

130
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,110
I just came to take a look.

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,610
Who ordered so many dishes?

132
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,059
Gosh.

133
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,909
And... don't drink beer.

134
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,630
It can make you feel bloated.

135
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,090
Look.

136
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,970
He's leaving.

137
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,690
I've let go.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,290
Do you...

139
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,450
feel relieved now?

140
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,110
Yes.

141
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,730
Where is he?

142
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,070
Why are you the only one here?

143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,240
He left with someone.

144
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
So bitter.

145
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,350
Don't drink it if it's bitter.

146
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,330
Kid,

147
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,190
we need to look forward.

148
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,550
In this world,

149
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,810
there is so much good stuff to taste.

150
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,970
Grandma.

151
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,410
You're going abroad.

152
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,930
Be good, okay?

153
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,630
If you want to come back,

154
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,920
come to me.

155
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,010
I'll ask Hei to move out.

156
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,990
And you'll stay in Hei's room.

157
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,170
Jiali likes you so much.

158
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,170
If someone found out I live with you,

159
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,940
my reputation would be ruined.

160
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,860
What are you talking about?

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,450
You really...

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,090
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)

163
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,380
Mr. Dou,

164
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,340
I'm going with you.

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,180
If anything happens,

166
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,930
we can take care of each other.

167
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,640
If you're going to let go, do it cleanly.

168
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,460
No.

169
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,300
You saved me.

170
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,260
My life is yours.

171
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,120
Why would I want your life?

172
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,010
You have your own life.

173
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,800
Take care.

174
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,120
You two too.

175
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,540
Mr. Dou.

176
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,490
Mr. Dou!

177
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,230
Boss!

178
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,660
Boss, don't leave us too.

179
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,960
Don't give up on us.

180
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,540
I won't leave you.

181
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,700
As long as I have a bite to eat,

182
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,010
you won't starve.

183
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,100
-Really?
-Really?

184
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,170
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

185
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,570
Boss, I love you the most.

186
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,870
It's okay if you're drunk.

187
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,810
You can rest at my place.

188
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,750
What do you want?

189
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,000
To make the rumor going around
the Intelligence Bureau come true.

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Do you agree?

191
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
Are you looking for a job?

192
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,430
Yes.

193
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,630
Are you trying to save money
to buy our home?

194
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,660
I want to pay back the money
I owe Mr. Dou as soon as I can

195
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,520
and then give you the best life.

196
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,830
I'm Bai,

197
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,040
but I'm not your toy boy.

198
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,050
We agreed to work hard together.

199
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,650
Mm.

200
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,680
Do you have any job in mind?

201
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,810
I used to do errands
for the convenience house.

202
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,710
Every time I saw

203
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,440
a client's problem get solved,

204
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,350
I felt a real sense of achievement.

205
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,610
Too bad—

206
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,220
if only the convenience house

207
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,920
was just about simple errands

208
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
and not all that complicated stuff.

209
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,360
Yeah.

210
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,160
If we could open one together,

211
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,460
that would be great.

212
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,100
Actually,

213
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,240
Mr. Dou handed
the convenience house over to me.

214
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,340
What do you mean?

215
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,140
He said he was giving the shop

216
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,740
to Jiali as part of her dowry.

217
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,170
But Jiali is still young,

218
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,140
so he asked me to take care of it for now.

219
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,990
Why did he ask you instead of me?

220
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,300
Because he was worried
you'd be too stubborn

221
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,430
and talk about giving him money again.

222
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,750
(Black & White Convenience House)

223
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,580
It's beautiful, right?

224
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,010
(Black & White Convenience House)

225
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,170
(Black & White Convenience House)

226
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,000
It's been half an hour

227
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,570
since Hei Yubo

228
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,840
went into that woman's house.

229
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,100
What took him so long?

230
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,040
What are they doing?

231
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,250
Are you waiting for me?

232
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,310
Who's waiting for you?

233
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,580
I just finished my work and passed by.

234
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,710
Why does this feel so familiar?

235
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,950
Are you following me again?

236
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,050
Yes.

237
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,620
I followed you here.

238
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,460
Because of this client?

239
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,520
This woman

240
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,980
has specifically requested you twice.

241
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,370
Who knows if she was just pretending

242
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,880
to have a job for you

243
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,990
because she's actually interested in you?

244
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,760
I already explained.

245
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,840
Last time, I went shopping with her

246
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,640
to pick a gift for her boyfriend.

247
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,710
She wanted a man's opinion.

248
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,910
This time, she invited you to her place.

249
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,350
She's moving today.

250
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,740
You knew that.

251
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,150
Her boyfriend was there too.

252
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,970
But...

253
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,690
She...

254
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,160
What are you doing?

255
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,470
You look cute when you're jealous.

256
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,900
Trying to shut me up with a kiss?

257
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,870
I can kiss you too.

258
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,570
You want to do this, huh?

259
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,640
Let's go home.

260
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,590
(One year later)

261
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,250
Stop eating.

262
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,990
Look at your belly.

263
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,510
No more snacks before meals.

264
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,240
Are you suggesting I'm fat?

265
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,270
You've changed.

266
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,940
You've changed since we were together.

267
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,740
You want to control everything.

268
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,040
You were the one who said

269
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,849
you wanted to be with me forever.

270
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,010
Then I won't talk to you anymore.

271
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,090
Hei.

272
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,690
So much for bantering.

273
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,270
What is this?

274
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,010
Although I took out a loan,

275
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,280
Bai Zhouqi,

276
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,740
this is our home.

277
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,770
It is registered under your name.

278
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,660
So,

279
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,930
don't abandon me.

280
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,980
Be a loyal and responsible man.

281
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,130
I will be responsible for you.

282
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,980
Hei Yubo,

283
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,640
you're never
getting rid of me in this lifetime.

284
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,410
(Love is always there)

285
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,810
(Two years later)

286
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,760
Does the Intelligence Bureau
have nothing to do these days?

287
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,190
Why do I always

288
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,480
see you two together?

289
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,360
You even called me here.
You're so carefree.

290
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,050
You look like an adult

291
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,670
in your suit.

292
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,990
You can really get married.

293
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,240
I did just come back from a wedding.

294
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,650
But I was the emcee.

295
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,970
The bride and the groom cried so hard.

296
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,340
If it were me today,

297
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,610
I would be touched too.

298
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,760
What's wrong with my brother?

299
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,120
What?

300
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,720
Your brother is 35 years old.

301
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,720
Men at this age

302
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,560
get a little sentimental.

303
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,810
Let me tell you.

304
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,330
When my dad passed away,

305
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Bai held my leg and cried like a baby.

306
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,650
When my grandpa scolded him,

307
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,340
he wouldn't go out.

308
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,350
And when he caused trouble,

309
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,860
he'd say, "Brother, help me."

310
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,480
But...

311
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,700
Hey, Brother.

312
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,120
Everyone needs to date someone.

313
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,070
Why don't you put out a dating ad?

314
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,480
If you hate the hassle of dating,

315
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,410
go straight to marriage.

316
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,510
Marriage.

317
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:00,710
Marriage.

318
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,710
Love

319
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,130
isn't about a perfect moment.

320
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,300
It's about long, continuous time.

321
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,220
It's not just about

322
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,220
two people watching TV on the couch.

323
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,250
It's when you turn off the TV,

324
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,280
you look into each other's eyes.

325
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,920

there's mutual understanding ♪

326

I haven't finished writing it.

333
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,310
I want you to help me finish it.

334
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,960
Three years ago,

335
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,280
you walked toward me.

336
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,920
Three years later,

337
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm walking toward you.

338
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,790
What?

339
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,610
Bai Zhouqi.

340
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,090
Are you willing to spend

341
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,990
the rest of your life with me,

342
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,200
an unromantic man?

343
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,740
Too fast?

344
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,410
Then we're not getting married.

345
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,770
Stop crying. Be good.

346
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,510
We're not getting married. It's okay.

347
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,940
Hei Yubo,

348
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,870
who said we're not getting married?

349
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,180
Help me put it on.

350
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,300
Look at you.

351
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,120
Your bad habit.

352
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,580
If you keep bending the finger,
the ring won't go in.

353
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,180
What if you can't take it off?

354
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,180
I'm never going to take it off.

355
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,840
Unless you cut off my finger.

356
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,520
The way you cried just now—

357
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,070
I thought you...

358
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,020
Grandpa said

359
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,720
in the Bai family,
seniority should be respected.

360
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,630
So my brother's gotta tie the knot first.

361
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,350
Well...

362
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,810
let's give it a try.

363
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,750
Say my name.

364
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,360
Bu Xing.

365
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,220
Got it.
