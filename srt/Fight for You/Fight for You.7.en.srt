(Fight for You)

2
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,340
Who would have thought that glutinous rice mixed with pig blood

3
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,140
would become this dish?

4
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,410
Then, add peanut powder

5
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,990
and cilantro.

6
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,240
This flavor...

7
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,590
The people we meet

8
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,340
are all predestined.

9
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,500
The longer we spend together, the harder it is to tell

10
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,960
whether we're meant to be or meant to suffer.

11
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,330
(File 7: Meeting You, Is It Meant to Be or Meant to Suffer?)

12
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,140
Last time, I asked...

13
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,880
if you wanted to be with me for real.

14
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,720
What is your answer?

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,450
Are you joking or serious?

16
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,300
This is the third time.

17
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,880
If you kiss me again,

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,970
I'll take it as you mean it.

19
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,440
What do you mean?

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,920
You haven't answered yet.

21
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,970
I want to know what you really think.

22
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,550
I mean it.

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,270
I hope you're not joking.

24
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,310
Let's give it a try then.

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,620
Give... give it a try?

26
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,350
You mean dating?

27
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,850
What else would we be trying?

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,730
Then, we start from now?

29
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,940
You want to schedule a start date?

30
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,540
I'm afraid you're gonna say

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
"just friends" in the next moment

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,660
and push me away, pretending nothing happened.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,010
The deal is sealed.

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
Now I can't run away anymore.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,560
Do you feel reassured now?

36
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,980
This is more reassuring.

37
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,370
Things will always work out somehow.

38
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,420
Hello?

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,690
Okay.

40
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Go, go, go.

41
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,010
Yes, it's very strong.

42
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,490
Are you ready?

43
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,180
Yes.

44
00:03:59,250 --> 00:03:59,970
Let's go.

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,280
What flavor should we get?

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,970
That one, that one.

48
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,440
That beef patty in the middle

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
has something really yummy inside.

50
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,040
It has truffle sauce.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,130
Give it to her later.

52
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,710
Okay.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,570
This is my first time.

54
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

55
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,830
Your order's here.

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,579
Thank you.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,730
Easy enough, right?

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,269
Twelve.

59
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,220
Super duper many.

60
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,360
Twelve...

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,830
Hold on a sec.

62
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,790
That's a lot.

63
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,190
Hello?

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,720
Okay, got it.

65
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,580
Where should we go next?

66
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,560
Let's go.

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,900
What should we do?

68
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,630
Which one does the client want?

00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,560

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,760
Come on, I'll help you.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Can you do it?

73
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,750
Do you even know how to hold it?

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,650
You were like a secret agent in the movies.

75
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,420
Well?

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,980
Isn't your boyfriend cool?

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,530
Why did you...

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
I just want you to know...

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,750
it's great to have you.

what's so good about being abroad?

86
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,060
Look at you. Without me taking care of you,

87
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,560
you've become so skinny.

(Mic on/off) (Camera on/off) (Hang up)

98
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,910
Here, Grandma.

99
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,340
Okay, good boy.

100
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,540
Thank you.

101
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,610
You can eat this, right?

102
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,310
Bai.

103
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,110
What do your family members do for work?

104
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
They're civil servants.

105
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,090
Then, has Hei met them yet?

106
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,310
Not yet.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Grandma, why did you suddenly ask that?

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,190
Nothing. I just...

109
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,700
hope that we can become a family soon.

110
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,820
It's too soon.

111
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,040
He'll feel pressured.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,390
That's right.

113
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,650
It's nothing.

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Bai, I just want to know more about you.

115
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,350
Eat up.

116
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,950
Let's dig in.

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,720
Okay.

118
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,850

If

124
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,380
I can't even honestly answer

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,470
these simple questions,

126
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,410
how will I explain things to him later?

127
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,770
What's wrong? Something up?

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,280
My thesis advisor

129
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,140
wants to see me.

130
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,580
What about this?

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,190
Take this home for me.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,050
Okay.

133
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,909
Then, I'll stay and help Grandma.

134
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:40,580
Okay.

135
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,140
Go.

136
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,870
Move out of your current apartment immediately.

137
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,780
Our surveillance operation has been going smoothly lately.

138
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,840
Why all of a sudden?

139
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,730
Explain it.

140
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,280
Did this happen all of a sudden?

141
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,810
I trained you myself.

142
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,070
You can't fool me.

143
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,150
No Sir...

144
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,650
I warned you before!

145
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,520
Don't let us down!

146
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,440
Intelligence Officer Bai Zhouqi,

147
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,760
because you have developed personal feelings

148
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,160
for your surveillance target, Hei Yubo...

149
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,730
you have lost the ability to judge right from wrong.

150
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,280
You've deceived your superiors

151
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,610
and betrayed our trust.

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,130
As per regulations, you must be dealt with severely.

153
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,270
I hereby order you to withdraw from the mission immediately.

154
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,930
All subsequent matters will be arranged and taken over by others.

155
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
I do...

156
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,810
have feelings

157
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,430
for Hei—no, for Hei Yubo.

158
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,490
I'm so disappointed in you, Bai Zhouqi.

159
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,790
I gave you a chance.

160
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,530
Hei Yubo is always on guard

161
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,410
and doesn't easily trust others.

162
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,720
At first, to get intel from him,

163
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,740
I did everything I could to get close to him

164
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,940
and gain his trust.

165
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,560
That's why I slipped up and crossed the line.

166
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,550
I've watched you grow up since you were little.

167
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,000
This is the first time I've seen you so brave.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,090
I know that Hei Yubo is my mission target.

169
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,370
I also know I shouldn't have other emotions toward him

170
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,660
to cloud my judgment.

171
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,490
But since you've been having him and me followed,

172
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,040
you should know

173
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,740
that he, like me,

174
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,340
is just a cover.

175
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,130
Getting smarter, huh?

176
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,110
So?

177
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,030
If you've only been using us

178
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,660
as pawns from the beginning,

179
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,940
you might as well continue.

180
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,830
If you bring in someone new now

181
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,950
who has to build a relationship with him from scratch,

182
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,210
all the effort invested in him previously will go to waste.

183
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:29,680
Instead,

184
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,020
you continue with your plan,

185
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,500
and I'll continue with mine.

186
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,490
You keep digging for your leverage,

187
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,630
and I'll be responsible for confirming

188
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,030
whether the person I like

189
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,860
is worth my doing all this.

190
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
I believe

191
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,240
that with Bai blood running through me,

192
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,350
I promise I'll hand him over myself.

193
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,830
Brother?

194
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,690
You still remember that you have a big brother?

195
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,870
The thing you want.

196
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:28,770
Honestly,

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,860
our family is a bit stuck in the past.

198
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
It's a new era now.

199
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,110
And you?

200
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,450
Still trying to have it both ways like in the old days.

201
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,260
Appearing obedient on the surface

202
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,930
while stubbornly doing whatever you want behind the scenes.

203
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,700
Zhouguo.

204
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,230
You heard, right?

205
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,320
Then... does Grandpa know about this yet?

206
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,680
These things haven't reached his ears yet.

207
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,260
The chief wants me to withdraw from the mission.

208
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,810
You know Bai is easily softhearted.

209
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,890
When he sees that young man doing

210
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,250
whatever it takes for his family,

211
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,450
of course, his sympathy overflows.

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
What?

213
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,830
No drinking during work hours.

214
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,400
What a pity.

215
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,070
It's vintage '61 Macallan inside.

216
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,190
This whisky...

217
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,510
stored in a container like this... is such a waste.

218
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,140
Just like your Bai,

219
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,330
being with you all... is such a waste.

220
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,450
Then, try to understand from the perspective of someone who's been there.

221
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,310
Weren't you the same with Dou Keyi before?

222
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,320
You were thick as thieves with him.

223
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,410
That was different.

224
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,490
How was it different?

225
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,650
You two were always together, inseparable.

226
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,250
Back then, rumors about you two were also spreading everywhere.

227
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,320
I... I mean,

228
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,180
judging people clearly is something

229
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,180
you only grasp after having experienced it yourself.

230
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,420
Don't

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,450
always use my grandfather's approach

232
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,420
of resorting to severe punishment for everything.

233
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,220
It's hard enough to recruit new people these days.

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,740
As far as I know,

235
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,430
you don't have

236
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,510
anyone around to replace Bai, right?

237
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,260
Anyway, our Bai

238
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,180
is just a smokescreen in your plan.

239
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,820
If you pull him out now,

240
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,990
what if my grandfather finds out?

241
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,270
What if it catches Dou Keyi's attention?

242
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,760
Aren't you afraid...

243
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,190
this could blow up?

244
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,980
What if he makes a mistake?

245
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We don't dare to trouble you, Chief.

246
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,460
Our Bai family

247
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,940
will bring him back and discipline him strictly ourselves.

248
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,190
You've given your word.

249
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,790
Yes.

250
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,460
What?

251
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
During work hours...

252
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,480
proper attire...

253
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,610
brings out your aura as the chief.

254
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,750
This flask is for you.

255
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll treat you to something even better next time.

256
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,640
Thank you, Zhouguo.

257
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,090
But please respect your work.

258
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,530
If something is wrong,

259
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,940
remember to correct it.

260
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,670
Correct it?

261
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,840
Zhouguo, he's really not a bad person.

262
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,550
It's not up to us to determine whether he's a bad guy or not.

263
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,320
Yes.

264
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,040
The higher-ups determine

265
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,540
who is good or bad.

266
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,060
Even though I can understand your feelings,

267
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,270
remember,

268
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,940
everything you say and do

269
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,470
represents our Bai family.

270
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,250
Keep your head clear.

271
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,810
Don't let emotions mess things up.

272
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm off.

273
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,120
Be good.

274
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,910
Got it?

275
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,980
Who was that guy?

276
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,670
What are you doing?

277
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,400
Why did he get to touch you like that?

278
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,010
You mean that really handsome guy just now?

279
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,780
You're calling another man handsome?

280
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,310
Explain yourself clearly.

281
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,320
He...

282
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,840
is pretty good-looking.

283
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't forget that you have a boyfriend.

284
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,090
Who was the one who went out

285
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,760
to eat with that girl before?

286
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,310
We're even now.

287
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,540
It can work like that?

288
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,990
Idiot.

289
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,240
That was my brother.

290
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,890
He is your brother?

291
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,590
Then, let's ask him to come back...

292
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,390
He had something to take care of.

293
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's go.

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
Let's go home.

295
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,090
Let's go.

296
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,750
Well... does your brother know we're together?

297
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,610
I didn't get a chance to tell him.

298
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,440
When can I meet your grandpa and your brother?

299
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,010
You will.

300
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,800
Don't worry.

301
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,670
You need to introduce us to each other.

302
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,370
Okay.

303
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,450
You want surveillance gear,

304
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,410
but you wouldn't apply through the department

305
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,630
because you are afraid of being bugged yourself?

306
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,480
Zhouguo, do you know

307
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,550
why No Sir assigned me this mission?

308
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,800
He has his reasons. Not our place to ask.

309
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
Why can you all

310
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,329
trust the organization's orders

311
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,950
so unconditionally?

312
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,060
Just doing whatever they instruct you to do.

313
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,560
Perhaps it's the subservience that's been passed down

314
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,420
through our Bai family line, etched into our bones.

315
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,270
I know you can't accept it from the bottom of your heart,

316
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,840
but...

317
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,870
do you dare to defy Grandpa?

318
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
What's wrong?

319
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,550
I have a cold.

320
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,810
I wanna some medicine.

321
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,800
Why are you up drinking alone

322
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,260
in the middle of the night?

323
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,060
I was scolded by my thesis advisor this afternoon.

324
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,990
So I'm drinking some beer to relieve stress.

325
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,440
Are you hiding something from me?

326
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,210
What do you mean?

327
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,090
Whether it's me almost being caught in a lie by Grandma

328
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,090
or me encountering difficulties on a task,

329
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,820
you're always there to help me.

330
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,320
You're involved in everything in my life.

331
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,210
But when it comes to your matters, you won't let me get involved.

332
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,610
Aren't I your boyfriend?

333
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,400
Getting scolded by my advisor happens all the time.

334
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,360
It's really just a minor thing.

335
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,920
Then why don't you rely on me more?

336
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,050
Or do you think I'm not someone you can trust?

337
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,650
Of course not.

338
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,540
I just don't want

339
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,530
to trouble you with my problems.

340
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,060
I know you're holding something back from me.

341
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,410
Bai,

342
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,770
what do your family members do for work?

343
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,590
They're civil servants.

344
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,160
Then, has Hei met them yet?

345
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,360
Not yet.

346
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,110
Maybe I still have a long way to go before I earn your trust.

347
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,230
But give me a little more time.

348
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,070
I'll definitely become a better person

349
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,000
so you can feel more at ease with me.

350
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,000
You're already great.

351
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,390
You love your family.

352
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,130
You're loyal to your friends.

353
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,270
I'm the one who's not good enough.

354
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,590
Bai.

355
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,800
Tell me what you're actually thinking.

356
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,830
If...

357
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,610
you get to know the real me someday,

358
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,220
you might regret it.

359
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,570
How could I?

360
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,910
You really trust me that much?

361
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,070
Of course.

362
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,360
How much do you trust me?

363
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,960
Other than my family,

364
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,360
you're the first person I've ever trusted.

365
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,980
Whenever I encounter a problem,

366
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,860
you're always the first one there to help me.

367
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,850
When I'm in danger,

368
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,180
you stand in front of me.

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,100
No matter what worries or past you have,

370
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,800
I'll accept them all.

371
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,460
Bai.

372
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,570
You must believe me.

373
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,510
Wait for me a second.

374
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,970
I need to use the bathroom.

375
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,590
I'm not that smart.

376
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,890
I can't guess if you don't tell me.

377
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,720
It shouldn't be just you giving me everything

378
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,290
while I give nothing back.

379
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,640
Or do you think...

380
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,840
I have nothing to give?

381
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,410
Bai,

382
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:56,880
(Preview)
Bai,

383
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,080
did you put this
(Preview)

384
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,370
on my ear for me?
(Preview)

385
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,850
It looks great on you.

386
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,320
If you've done something wrong for my sake,

387
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,890
I'd rather not have the surgery.

388
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,830
Hei Jiali.

389
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,850
What kind of task pays enough to cover an entire surgery bill?

390
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,570
You'd have to risk your life for that, right?

391
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,950
I need more tasks.

392
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,180
Why don't you let me help you?

393
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,530
Why draw such a hard line between us?

394
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,430
Then why haven't you introduced me

395
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,870
to your family?

396
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,640
Are you afraid they won't approve of me as I am now?

397
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,670
You don't know me at all!

398
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,730
Looks like we won't be able to find common ground.
