A person should have self-knowledge.

If you can't afford it,

4
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,820
just admire it from afar.

5
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,780
But what if one day,

6
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,810
someone gives you the apple?

7
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Would you be willing to give it back?

Why didn't you wake me up?

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,710
Did they do the morning rounds?

13
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,770
How is your sister?

14
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,670
Don't worry.

15
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,220
We can go in to see her soon.

16
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,480
How about...

17
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,960
singing you a song?

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm going to the bathroom.

22
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,720
I'll buy you breakfast on the way.

23
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,850
Don't threaten the doctor into hiding things from me from now on.

24
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,110
Nothing really happened.

25
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,380
They were too nervous.

26
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,920
I'm okay.

27
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,630
What if something really happened?

28
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,090
You didn't tell me anything either.

29
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,960
Your brother was worried about you.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,130
He didn't sleep at all last night.

31
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,990
He waited outside the whole time.

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,820
So... you accompanied him?

33
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,890
Grandma said my brother has a boyfriend.

34
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,100
Yes.

35
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,810
It's me.

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,880
Since when did my brother start liking men?

37
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,020
He's so busy. How could he have time to date?

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,270
What's your intention of approaching my brother?

39
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,280
He's not rich.

40
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,070
Do you covet his body?

41
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,990

Jiali...

44
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,860
The Intelligence Bureau should

45
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,600
hire someone like her.

46
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,410
I wonder if she's willing to work there.

47
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,579
Don't zone out.

48
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,490

52

54

Money doesn't matter either.

55
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,890
Besides, I've got both the looks and the brains.

56
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,010
Right,

57
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,510
I met your grandma too.

58
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,820
She likes me a lot.

59
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,590
Who would praise himself like that?

60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,920
Because I'm worth it.

61
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,260
Brother,

62
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
I want some juice.

63
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,810
Did the doctor say you can drink it?

64
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,410
Yes.

65
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,270
I'll go.

66
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,580
You stay with your sister.

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,890
It's okay.

68
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,370
Let my brother go.

69
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,510
He knows what I like to drink.

70
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,740
You stay with me.

71
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,980
What's wrong?

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,730
My brother doesn't trust others easily.

73
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,030
He brought you here.

74
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,030
That means you're different to him.

75
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,880
Can I ask you for a favor?

76
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,520
Go ahead.

77
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,730
Don't let him do bad things.

78
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,350
He's at his wits' end because of my illness.

79
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm sure he'll go to Dou Keyi.

80
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm worried he'll be dragged into their mess.

81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,210
Help me stop him.

82
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,970
Otherwise, I'd rather die.

83
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,080
Don't worry.

84
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,290
Leave it to me.

85
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,110
If he doesn't behave,

86
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,410
I'll spank him.

87
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,300
Then take him away later.

88
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,720
And call the doctor here.

89
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,730
What's wrong?

90
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,950
Are you not feeling well?

91
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm going now.

92
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,700
Just a little discomfort.

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
Don't tell my brother.

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,180
He gets nervous easily.

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,990
He won't leave if he knows.

96
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,040
Have a good rest.

97
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,750
We'll fight through this together.

98
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,680
The doctor said

99
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,570
as long as there's no rejection to the new medicine,

100
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,630
Jiali can have surgery soon.

101
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,110
You can worry.

102
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,620
But don't forget

103
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,340
you are not alone.

104
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm with you.

105
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,659
I've been accepted by both Grandma and Jiali.

106
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,650
If this continues,

107
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,250
it'll become increasingly real.

108
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,490
What's wrong?

109
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,760
That woman just asked me out again.

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,750
Once the convenience house's matters are settled,

111
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,950
and my sister's surgery goes smoothly,

112
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,120
everything will go back to normal, right?

113
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,640
Help me stop him.

114
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,110
Otherwise, I'd rather die.

115
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,890
Make it quick,

116
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,980
so that there won't be more trouble.

117
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,570
If I go with you,

118
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,900
at least I can protect you

119
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,240
if anything happens.

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
You look like her ex-boyfriend.

121
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,230
You just want to get something back

122
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,460
from her, right?

123
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,770
No more hesitation.

124
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,850
Just mesmerize her.

125
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,580
Mesmerize her?

126
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,600
Just being around her makes me uncomfortable.

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,670
Then...

128
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,560
what about when you're around me?

129
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,670
I like it very much.

130
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,909
When I'm around you...

131
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,150
everything feels just right.

132
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,539
Why don't you teach me again?

133
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,809
I can just pretend

134
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,630
she's you. Right?

135
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,840
You want me to drive your car to pick her up?

136
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,610
Yes.

137
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,780
You can't ride a motorbike for a date, right?

138
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,980
Do you have a license?

139
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,190
Yes.

140
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,810
What?

141
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,910
Handsome, right?

142
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,260
What are you doing?

143
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,120
Unbuckling your seatbelt.

144
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,040
In case I don't want to get off because you're so handsome.

145
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,140
You're so good at this.

146
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,180
Then you try it.

147
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,750
Let me see if that woman will be so impressed

148
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,680
by your handsome face that she doesn't want to leave.

149
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,610
So?

150
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,620
Did I pass?

151
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,800
Not bad.

152
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,080
But you were not hot enough to keep me in the car.

153
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,910
You're back.

154
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,720
You're all dressed up. Where are you going?

155
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,520
I thought the date was tomorrow.

156
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,710
Just now, there was a case

157
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,630
about profiles on a dating website.

158
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,810
They said I should wear formal clothes.

159
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,070
It's rare to see you dressed so formally.

160
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,450
I went to the monthly meeting.

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,880
It really gave me a headache.

162
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,700
So annoying.

163
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,950
There were a bunch of professors.

164
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,750
Old-school.

165
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,000
Did you drink?

166
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,150
No.

167
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,270
You told me to learn how to mesmerize people, right?

168
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,960
I just realized you look great when you take off your clothes.

169
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,250
You try it.

170
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,690
Take off my clothes?

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,110
Should I continue?

172
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,030
Enough!

173
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,360
Enough.

174
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,790
Is that okay?

175
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,940
Enough.

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm going to the bathroom.

177
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,410
To the bathroom again?

178
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,710
You want to use the bathroom?

179
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,710
You can use it now.

180
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,420
Do you want to be with me for real?

181
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,880
Can I be with you for real?

182
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,860
Don't say no.

183
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,440
If I'm with you because...

184
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,830
If you like someone,

185
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,530
just...

186
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,340
do it.

187
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,200
Do you want to be with me for real?

188
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,670
Impressive.

189
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,700
You're not bad even without drinking.

190
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,570
Go like this tomorrow.

191
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,570
Wish you success.

192
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,200
Bai Zhouqi!

193
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,740
You know I was not kidding.

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,830
It's quite concise.
(Dou Keyi Convenience House)

205
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,910
I thought

206
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,170
there was no need to go over the mundane stuff.

207
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,710
Why waste words?

208
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,490
So...

209
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,980
no progress?

210
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,420
If I'm not the only one

211
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,460
sent by No Sir to tail Hei,

212
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,780
he must know his whereabouts.

213
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
I can't lie to him.

214
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,970
He's made contact with the target,

215
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,270
but he didn't get anything back.

216
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,930
They're expected to act again tomorrow.

217
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,050
But from what I've observed,

218
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,720
they don't really know what they're doing.

219
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,350
Hello?

220
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,790
Hello?

221
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,970
That's it then.

222
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,280
You can choose how you want to do it.

223
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,300
But...

224
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,360
don't let us down.

225
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,340
You said you'd treat me to a meal

226
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,410
to cheer me up.

227
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,370
This is it?

228
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,180
Mm.

229
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,829
Why don't we terminate the mission?

230
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,790
Why?

231
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,810
Didn't you ask me to repay Mr. Dou's favor

232
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,940
as soon as possible?

233
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,020
But seeing you seduce someone

234
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,580
makes me feel like you're cheating on me.

235
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,800
I'm jealous.

236
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,660
There must be something fishy

237
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,020
about the call from No Sir.

238
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,170
It might be safer to make you

239
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,780
fail early.

240
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,500
So you still want to go?

241
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,550
Yes.

242
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,400
I've come this far.

243
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,930
I don't want to make things difficult for Mr. Dou and the others.

244
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,270
Mr. Dou, Mr. Dou.

245
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,580
Maybe your Mr. Dou has never

246
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,980
wanted you to get involved.

247
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,600
That Shi wants to drag you into this.

248
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,290
I don't want to owe them.

249
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,800
Whatever.

250
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,070
You won't listen to me,

251
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,220
but you do whatever they tell you to do.

252
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,450
Once this case is closed,

253
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,430
we'll go our separate ways.

254
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,580
Back to strangers.

255
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,640
You're not eating?

256
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,900
I've lost my appetite!

257
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,810
He drove my car

258
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,150
to pick her up for dinner.

259
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,460
And in a romantic environment...

260
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,520
That woman probably won't make the delivery today.

261
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,170
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,270
Grandma?

263
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,730
You should watch where you're going!

264
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,100
Sorry, I didn't see you.

265
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,040
Let me help you.

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,570
Right,

267
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,000
why are you alone?

268
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,690
Hei is working.

269
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,820
Grandma.

270
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,780
Have you seen Hei in a suit?

271
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,210
No.

272
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,280
He looks amazing.

273
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,550
Really?

274
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,380
Yes, let me show you.

275
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,410
Come. Sit.

276
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,360
Look.

277
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,050
Bai.

278
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Talk to him when you have time.

279
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,960
I know money is very important,

280
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,510
but as long as we don't starve, that's enough.

281
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,460
I've never spent a penny of the money he gave me.

282
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,270
I've saved it all.

283
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
I'll give it back to him

284
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,870
before I die.

285
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,990
Grandma.

286
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,490
You know in my family, it's all men.

287
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,030
Grandma couldn't stand Grandpa.

288
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,100
My mom couldn't stand my dad.

289
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,660
We grew up being beaten and scolded.

290
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,060
It was that kind

291
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,340
of iron-blooded parenting.

292
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,560
So,

293
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,380
I really envy you and Hei.

294
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,030
I'll do my best to help him.

295
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,100
Don't worry.

296
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,850
After his parents passed away,

297
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,090
I forced Hei to bring his sister

298
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,350
to live with me.

299
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,780
How could a teenager know how to live alone?

300
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,440
You know his temper.

301
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,260
He's stubborn.

302
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,010
He didn't want me to be tired from running the braised food stall,

303
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,350
so he told me to shut it down.

304
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,910
My business was fine.

305
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,710
Why should I shut it down? Right?

306
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,830
He even got mad and said

307
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,070
he'd earn the living expenses himself.

308
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,770
He just won't listen.

309
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,880
He listened.

310
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,940
But he didn't take it to heart.

311
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,670
Yeah.

312
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,690
We haven't known each other for long,

313
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,230
but I think

314
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,100
you are my destined lover.

315
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,700
What about your boyfriend?

316
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,180
He's already dead.

317
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,050
Why are you mentioning him?

318
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,190
You're still wearing the necklace he gave you.

319
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,990
How are you going to prove

320
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,060
he's not important to you anymore?

321
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,260
What will it take for you to believe me?

322
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,930
Give me the necklace. I'll throw it away.

323
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,560
Tell me you love me.

324
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,090
Then I'll give you everything.

325
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,350
Kiss me.

326
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,500
Where did you come from?

327
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,800
He's mine!

328
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,620
Hei, who is he?

329
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,760
Hei?

330
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,910
Hei?

331
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,890
Tell her who I am.

332
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
He is my...

333
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,890
You adulterers!

334
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,550
Don't beat him!

335
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,180
Don't!

336
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,430
You are the other woman!

337
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,880
You homewrecker!

338
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,120
Be gentle!

339
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Be gentle!

340
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,340
I almost succeeded.

341
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
Why did you suddenly show up?

342
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,980
(On this dark and windy night, which romantic place will you go?)
(We'll just take a walk by the riverside.)

343
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,350
(Humph! Don't cross the line!)
(On this dark and windy night, which romantic place will you go?)
(We'll just take a walk by the riverside.)

344
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,440
We haven't known each other for long,

345
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,250
but I think

346
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,740
you are my destined lover.

347
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,010
You're still wearing the necklace he gave you.

348
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,270
Give me the necklace. I'll throw it away.

349
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,200
Kiss me.

350
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,900
I told you

351
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,580
I don't want to see you with anyone else,

352
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,580
even if it's just an act.

353
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,930
Why?

354
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
You helped me so much before.

355
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,830
I regret it.

356
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,520
I feel uncomfortable seeing you with someone else.

357
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,850
What?

358
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,520
You want to go?

359
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Go ahead.

360
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,770
I asked you

361
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,020
if you want to be with me for real.

362
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,750
Your answer is...

363
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,690
Were you serious or not?

364
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,330
This is the third time.

365
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,910
If you kiss me again,

366
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,920
I'll take it seriously.

367
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,040

Bai,

373

what do your family members do?

374
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,590
Move out of your current apartment immediately.

375
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,880
I gave you a chance!

376
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,350
I'm so disappointed in you, Bai Zhouqi.

377
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,370
I order you to withdraw from the mission immediately.

378
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,940
You should dress appropriately during work hours

379
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,280
to demonstrate your demeanor as the chief.

380
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,520
If you get to know more about the real me,

381
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,920
you might regret it.

382
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,800
Are you hiding something from me?

383
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,910
What do you mean?
