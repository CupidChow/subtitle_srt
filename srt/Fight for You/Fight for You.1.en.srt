(Fight for You)

2
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,850
Sometimes it's not about right or wrong.

3
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,900
Don't you have anyone you care about?

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,810
For them,

5
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm willing to do anything.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,920
(File 1: A relationship that starts with cohabitation)

7
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,750
What color do you want for the sofa?

8
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,160
I want black.

9
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,640
White.

10
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,550
White gets dirty easily.

11
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,160
Black hides the dirt.

12
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,370
In terms of physics,

13
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,460
black and white are not colors,

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
but chroma.

15
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,750
In other words,

16
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,440
white is the presence of all light,

17
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,350
while black is the absence of it.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,650
It absorbs all the surrounding light,

19
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,870
which makes it appear black.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Just like coal — an excellent light absorber,

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,810
which is why it looks so black.

22
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,090
Also, why am I the one in charge of the bathroom?

23
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,370
Because I'm in charge of other areas.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,840
That was your own decision.

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,360
Did you ever ask me?

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,100
What do you want then?

27
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,260
Since you both have no objection, forget about the sofa.

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,030
Let's go upstairs to see your rooms.

29
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,620
-I want this one.
-I want this one.

30
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,680
I already stated that I wanted a room with sunlight.

31
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,180
I paid the deposit first.

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,620
I should choose first.

33
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,580
Are you doing this on purpose?

34
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,120
Who would be that childish?

35
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,710
The other room doesn't get sunlight. I don't like it.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,350
Since you both like this room,

37
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,960
how about...

38
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,160
sharing a room?

39
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,610
The room is big enough, and it's a double bed.

40
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,110
Sharing a room

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,410
might even help you get along better.

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,110
Hengsi, what are you doing?

43
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,720
What took you so long?

44
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,390
It's just renting a place, not buying a house.

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
Or are you giving them a hard time?

46
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,890
They were arguing about the sofa's color just now,

47
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,650
and now they're fighting over the room.

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,950
I just suggested they could share a room

49
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,530
to improve their relationship.

50
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,300
They're a couple?

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,790
Who's a couple with him?

52
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,170
Why are you two so in sync then?

53
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,890
It's okay.

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,320
If you share a room,

55
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,540
I can give you a discount.

56
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,240
I'll give you three minutes to think about it.

57
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,770
No need to force yourselves if you don't like it.

58
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,360
Time should be spent on love,

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,180
not arguing.

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,090
By the way,

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,140
if you decide to rent,

62
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,310
don't touch anything here.

63
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,290
Bai Zhouqi, what are you doing?

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,050
Have you forgotten why you came here?

65
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,890
Where are you going?

66
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,080
I'll let you have this room. I'll find another one.

67
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,010
Don't waste time.

68
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,380
Finding another one is such a hassle.

69
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,310
Take that room.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,310
Come. Look.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
This room is perfect for me.

72
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,520
Didn't you say you don't like rooms without sunlight?

73
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,440
It suddenly occurred to me I'm afraid of getting tanned.

74
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,180
Besides, first come, first served, right?

75
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,450
You can have that room.

76
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,130
I'm okay with cleaning the bathroom too.

77
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,050
Fate brought us together.

78
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,840
Since we'll live in the same place,

79
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,909
we should get along.

80
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,590
Right?

81
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,210
Besides, the environment here is peaceful,

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
the rent is cheap,

83
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,640
and the space is nice.

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,180
Why should we give it up to someone else?

85
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,880
It's better to make friends than enemies.

86
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,830
Why don't we rent it together

87
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,990
and negotiate a lower price with the landlord?

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,950
Okay.

89
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,920
Hello, my name is Bai Zhouqi.

90
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,090
You can just call me Bai.

91
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,700
What a coincidence.

92
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,300
I'm Hei, Hei Yubo.

93
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,000
Hei?

94
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,810
Nice to meet you.

95
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,940
Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,159
You're going out so early?

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
To work.

98
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,560
Work?

99
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,970
By the way, what do you do?

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,560
I work for someone.

101
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,140
Where do you work?

102
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,230
Aren't you going to school?

103
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,350
I don't have class today.

104
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,700
Oh.

105
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,860
Wait.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,850
This is for you. My treat.

107
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,420
I don't owe others favors.

108
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,950
And... I'm allergic to milk.

109
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,150
Jump.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,650
You go... left. Left.

111
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,250
Yeah.

112
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,810
Press A?

113
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,850
A. Yes.

114
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,680
Wait.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,850
One, two, three.

116
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,159
(Grandma)
(Answer) (Refuse)

117
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,840
Hello, Grandma.

118
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,140
Have you forgotten me since you moved out?

119
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,730
You haven't even given me a phone call.

120
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,870
No.

121
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,740
There's just been too much going on with the move.

122
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,780
Too much to do, or too annoying?

123
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,670
What do you mean?

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,840
You moved out to live with your girlfriend.

125
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,350
You're so busy, yet you still need to take care of her.

126
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,700
Isn't that annoying?

127
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,450
Grandma,

128
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,950
I never said you couldn't come.

129
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,120
It's messy here right now.

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
It's not that she doesn't want to see you.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,350
You've watched too many dramas.

132
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,660
(Hei Shilin) (Hei Yubo) (Girlfriend)

133
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,090
Very filial.
(Hei Shilin) (Hei Yubo) (Girlfriend)

134
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,970
(Hei Shilin) (Hei Yubo) (Girlfriend)

135
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,039
But he used living with his girlfriend
(Hei Shilin) (Hei Yubo) (Girlfriend)

136
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,630
as an excuse to move out.
(Hei Shilin) (Hei Yubo) (Girlfriend)

(Hei Yubo) (Hei Jiali) (Sister)

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,919
(Hei Yubo) (Hei Jiali) (Sister) (Hei Shilin)

139
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,990
Is it necessary for him to move out
(Hei Yubo) (Hei Jiali) (Sister) (Hei Shilin)

140
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,580
to save up for medical expenses?

(Answer) (Refuse)

142
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,120
Pretty girl, how's your health?

(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

144
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,490
Brother, the new medicine makes me uncomfortable.

(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

146
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,460
Can I switch back to the old medicine?
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

147
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,010
Be good. The doctor said the new medicine works better.

148
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
You'll get used to it.

149
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:38,640
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,880
But I heard this medicine is very expensive.
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

151
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,890
It's not that expensive.

152
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,710
By the way,

153
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,400
I told Grandma

154
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,850
you went abroad for a training camp.

155
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,380
She scolded me for ages.

156
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,170
Come back soon, okay?

157
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,650
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)
Come back soon, okay?

158
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:53,760
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

159
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
I don't want to get caught.

160
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,110
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

161
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,260
Right.

162
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,650
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

163
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,950
Your favorite claw machine just got a new set of prizes.
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)

164
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,170
This time, I got one for just 120 NT dollars.

165
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,160
I'll bring it to you next time.

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:17,820
Okay.

167
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,420
(Mic on/off)(Camera on/off)
Okay.

168
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,470

170
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,630
Okay.

171
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,340
Here, enjoy. Your drinks will be ready soon.

172
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,730
Mr. Dou?

173
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,660
(Braised Food)

174
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,940
Long time no see.

175
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,310
I thought you were dead.

176
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,910
Or were you imprisoned?

177
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,980
Ms. Hei, you missed me, right?

178
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,210
Why would I miss you?

179
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,230
I'm right here. You can look all you want.

180
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,960
Who wants to look? What do you want to eat?

181
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,050
The same as usual.

182
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,910
Okay.

183
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,940
Wait.

184
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,660
Madam.

185
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,560
I want the same.

186
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,910
The same? What do you mean?

187
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,840
The... The same as that.

188
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,600
It's a limited edition. You can't afford it.

189
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,810
Here. Order here.

190
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,580
Order whatever you want. They're all delicious.

191
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:54,890
I want this.

192
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,610
Okay.

193
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,570
Go find a seat. Suit yourself.

194
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,600
Wait a minute.

195
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,370
Health insurance doesn't cover it?

196
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,180
Huh?

197
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,650
Valve repair without sternotomy?

198
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,010
May I ask how much the valve replacement costs?

199
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,360
Self-pay?

200
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,960
No problem.

201
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,320
Okay, thank you.

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,850
Ms. Hei, can I borrow someone to help carry some goods?

204
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,050

Does your grandma know about this?

208
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,950
I don't want her to worry.

209
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,150
My sister doesn't want her to know either.

210
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,240
How much?

211
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,490
I asked how much.

212
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,650
After deducting what health insurance covers,

213
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,130
I still need about 400,000 NT dollars.

214
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,280
Stop playing.

215
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,540
Go take care of it.

216
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,150
Us?

217
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,560
Should I go?

218
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,220
Okay.

It'll be fine if she doesn't know.

240

If you don't agree,

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,430

Was it really just a cat?

370
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,860
How can I get closer to him?

371
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,010
From now on,

372
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,480
you should follow the chief's guidance.

373
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,550
Yes, sir!

374
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,920
Call me No Sir.

375
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,780
Hei Yubo is inexperienced.

376
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,970
Is there a way

377
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,700
to make him one of us?

378
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,290
Where is she?

379
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,520
Who?

380
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,650
The woman who wouldn't let me come.

381
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,890
Where is she?

382
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,510
So?

383
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,910
I'm pretty useful.

384
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,050
Why don't you consider making me your boyfriend?

385
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,150
Hmm?
