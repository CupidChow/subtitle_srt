00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,959
(Fight for You)

2
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,370
People always say that good and evil cannot coexist.

3
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,280
But can the right and the wrong

4
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,070
be absolute?

5
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,450
Whether we're a match or not,

6
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,850
we decide for ourselves.

7
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,440
There is a kind of willingness...

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,680
that exists because that person is you.

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,860
There's a kind of persistence that lasts until the end

10
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,390
because that person is you.

11
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:41,020
(File 10: I Won't Give Up on You)

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,940
You still changed the bandages for me.

13
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,380
That means even if you're angry,

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,039
you'll still forgive me, right?

15
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,650
I admit,

16
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,970
at first, I approached you with ulterior motives.

17
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,789
But I don't know when it started—

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,580
watching you work so hard for Grandma

19
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,850
and for Jiali,

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,680
I started to hate who I was.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,729
So I wanted to quickly help you finish the task

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,130
and end everything.

23
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,800
But somewhere along the way, I fell for you.

24
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,579
I wanted to tell you the truth many times...

25
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,250
but I knew

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,800
that the moment I did,

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,320
it would all be over between us.

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,140
Don't you want me anymore?

29
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,940
Hei...

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,340
Just wait for me a little longer.

31
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,170
At least let me say goodbye...

32
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,300
You think he still wants to talk to you?

33
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,010
From renting this place

34
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,540
to becoming his roommate to surveilling him—

35
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,250
from the very beginning, you two were destined to be on opposite sides.

36
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,980
Now, you just say, “Sorry, it was for the mission.

37
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,579
Let's just be friends?"

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,210
Bai Zhouqi,

39
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,720
are you the idiot here, or is he?

40
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,370
I don't know,

41
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,690
and I don't want to know

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,840
just how real your act with him became.

43
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,570
But let me give you a piece of advice:

44
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,720
don't challenge our grandfather.

45
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,360
Stop struggling.

46
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,340
Or you'll reopen your wound.

47
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,450
Okay.

48
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll go pack up.

49
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,600
No need.

50
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,830
I'll send someone to pack for you.

51
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,430
Don't keep Grandpa waiting.

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,409
Zhouguo...

53
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,110
Let's go.

54
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,280
-Zhouguo...
-Go!

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,470
Zhouguo...

56
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,020
Outlier.

57
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,760
How could our Bai family have an outlier like you?

58
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,560
Rumors at the Intelligence Bureau say my grandson

59
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,540
has lost control over a target

60
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
and has even fallen in love with him!

61
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,850
And now you've even taken a bullet for such a person!

62
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,050
What kind of person?

63
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,260
Grandpa, you've never seen Hei

64
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,790
and don't understand him.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,960
How can you deny everything about him

66
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,150
just because he's on the other side?

67
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,550
Since ancient times, good and evil have always been enemies.

68
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,720
People like him are a threat

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,580
and the source of chaos.

70
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,110
They shouldn't even exist!

71
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,320
Hei is the most loyal

72
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,240
and kind-hearted person I've ever met!

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,409
Still talking back?

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,070
This is the first time in our family's history

75
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,740
that someone has been suspended as punishment.

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,990
What a disgrace!

77
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,980
Grandpa, stop clinging to those outdated ways of thinking!

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,710
You think you're clear-headed

79
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,770
about right and wrong, but you're not!

80
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,800
What did you say?

81
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,060
What did you say?

82
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,120
What did you say?

83
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,940
What did you say?

84
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,910
Grandpa!

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,140
Bai hasn't recovered yet.

86
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,390
You can wait until he's better

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,790
before disciplining him.

88
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,830
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)
before disciplining him.

89
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:10,860
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,520
How are you being his brother?
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

91
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:12,790
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

92
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,750
Don't tell me you know nothing.
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,680
And that Bu Xing.

94
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,740
What kind of boss is he?

95
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,570
That convenience house has been around for years, and we still haven't caught them.

96
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:24,700
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

97
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,860
Is he incompetent,
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

98
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,500
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

99
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,830
or is he deliberately letting them slide?
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

100
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,410
Understood.

101
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,870
I'll relay your message

102
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,170
to Bu Xing.

103
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,820
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

104
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,260
(Loyalty, Compassion, and Integrity)

105
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,350
Are you alright?

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,810
I told you

107
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
not to go head-to-head with Grandpa.

108
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,380
Hei!

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,380
Zhouguo.

110
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,770
I'm here to get his things.

111
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,510
Is Bai alright?

112
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,750
Even if he wasn't, what could you do about it?

113
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,090
Don't be too hard on him. He's injured now.

114
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
You really care about him...

115
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,650
and don't hate him?

116
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,300
He lied to you.

117
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,120
He's suffering just as much from having lied to me.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,990
This job was never right for him.

119
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,100
That's the mission of a man from the Bai family.

120
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,230
No one cares whether you want it or not.

121
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,980
If he hadn't met you,

122
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,840
he wouldn't be in such a difficult position.

123
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,910
He had never been in a relationship before,

124
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,570
and his sympathy runs wild.

125
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,690
But you...

126
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,680
you look tough enough.

127
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Hold back and don't contact him.

128
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,530
As time goes by,

129
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,660
he'll forget.

130
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,159
Hei,

131
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,220
the drinks in the fridge are all mine.

132
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,150
You drink water.

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,860
I found it.

134
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,610
It was right underneath. How could you not see it?

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,190
Look!

136
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,760
I managed to keep it alive.

137
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,730
For you.

138
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,340
We sent our Bai to the Intelligence Bureau all safe and sound,

139
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,800
and now he returns home with a gunshot wound.

140
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,850
Chief,

141
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,450
don't you owe us an explanation?

142
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
Forget it.

143
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,490
Seeing you like this

144
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,770
is worse than scolding you.

145
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,820
You got beaten up too?

146
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,490
It really hurts!

147
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,500
You would have been beaten too if you had been there.

148
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
So, after all that trouble,

149
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,720
did you catch them?

150
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,130
Yes.

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,740
The thing they were trading that day.

152
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,270
Isn't this...

153
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,730
Sweet potato starch!

154
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,870
Dou Keyi is really something.

155
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,090
My poor Bai took a bullet

156
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,450
for this small bag of sweet potato starch.

157
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,570
Right,

158
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
how are you going to handle Hei Yubo?

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
What about him?

160
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,690
He showed up at the scene with a box of sweet potato starch

161
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,810
and was ambushed before he could do anything else.

162
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,780
And your brother has defended him like that.

163
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,150
So, I've asked Bai to deal with him.

164
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,910
What a joke, right?

165
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,510
Yeah.

166
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,040
Dou Keyi got away clean

167
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,850
and even got the Intelligence Bureau

168
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,780
to get rid of the man he was planning to double-cross.

169
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,340
Two birds with one stone.

170
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,360
Dou Keyi really is a genius.

171
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,470
What?

172
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,860
Hand Dou Keyi's case to someone else.

173
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,170
Do you know that you're mixing

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,930
in too many personal feelings?

175
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,920
If it had been Dou Keyi standing there

176
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,990
that day instead of Hei,

177
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,520
would you still have let them open fire?

178
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,960
I heard

179
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,430
what you said outside my door that day.

180
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,540
Are you okay?

181
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,480
Shall we talk properly?

182
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,210
Just remember

183
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,940
that unfulfilled wish of mine.

184
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,580
You promised me a wish!

185
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,040
Don't get involved with the convenience house anymore.

186
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,200
If you still want to be with me,

187
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,320
then don't go.

188
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,950
Why don't you eat?

189
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
You said

190
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,220
as long as I cut ties with him,

191
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,710
you would leave him alone.

192
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,730
Why are you still having people investigate him?

193
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,140
If he hasn't done anything wrong, why should he
be afraid of being investigated?

194
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,480
Every time I mention that Hei guy,

195
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,810
whatever I say, you argue back.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,970
You're hopeless!

197
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,740
Tell me, what is all this?

198
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,190
Was all of this just for the mission?

199
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,350
Isn't your boyfriend cool?

200
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,180
It's great to have you.

201
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,380
Don't forget,

202
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,630
you have a boyfriend now.

203
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,970
I know. You have strong empathy.

204
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,480
Combined with your guilt,

205
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,840
it's making you unable to move on.

206
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,750
It's understandable.

207
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,510
All right.

208
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,180
The mission is done.

209
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,310
I failed the mission!

210
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,280
Because I've fallen in love with him.

211
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,380
It must be that Hei guy who taught you these bad ideas!

212
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,580
Grandpa,

213
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,980
I'm the cruel one.

214
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,410
I'm the one who fell in love with him!

215
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,250
Shut up!

216
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,490
Both of you are men.

217
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,040
What love?

218
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,330
How can two men be together?

219
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,490
How inappropriate!

220
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,690
Times have changed, Grandpa.

221
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,300
Why can't we?

222
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,020
Why can't my love for someone

223
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,350
simply be accepted?

224
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,240
Zhouguo, it hurts.

225
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,050
Be gentler!

226
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,020
Didn't you just act all tough earlier,

227
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,550
not making a peep?

228
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,030
That was different.

229
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,070
In the heat of the moment, I had to hold it together!

230
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,090
You're so brave, huh?

231
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Is it worth it?

232
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,440
What if he doesn't want you anymore after all this?

233
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,210
Hei is not that kind of person.

234
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,430
You sure trust him, don't you?

235
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,490
How's Grandpa doing?

236
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,250
Finding out you've fallen in love with your mission target—

237
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,650
and a man at that—

238
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,220
is a huge shock

239
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,830
for him.

240
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,960
Do you understand?

241
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,400
I know it's hard for Grandpa.

242
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,150
But a little bump

243
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,369
won't dent a steel wall.

244
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,140
If you want to break through, go big!

245
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,910
You...

246
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,550
you look harmless on the outside,

247
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,480
but you're actually

248
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,680
the most stubborn one in our Bai family.

249
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,530
You're already like this,

250
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,330
and you're still going on a hunger strike protest?

251
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,610
If only Hei were here.

252
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,920
Sorry to disappoint.

253
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,080
I'm not Hei.

254
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,060
I never thought

255
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,990
I'd do this behind Grandpa's back.

256
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,530
I'm helping you not because I approve of you,

257
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,130
but because our Bai Zhouqi

258
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,200
is the type who never gives up once he's made up his mind.

259
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm afraid if you ignored him,

260
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,510
he'd blame himself

261
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,400
and might even come to resent others.

262
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,410
But I...

263
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,010
I'm also afraid that he doesn't want to talk to me.

264
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,340
I'm more afraid that he'll run away from home because of you.

265
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,200
If Grandpa really goes berserk, no one can stop him.

266
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,540
He's really torn, too.

267
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,540
Grandpa forced him to cut ties with you

268
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,280
by offering to let you off.

269
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,500
He's worried that you'll keep getting tangled up with the convenience house.

270
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,440
To be honest,

271
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,240
you are just two kids

272
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,740
who know nothing.

273
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,890
You two kids

274
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,620
just behave yourselves for a while.

275
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,340
Wait until we adults sort things out,

276
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,070
and then you can date or break up however you like.

277
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
We won't break up.

278
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,960
I want to be the one who protects Bai

279
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,840
and shoulders everything for him.

280
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,930
Let me just say this:

281
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,670
if you're going to do that, wait a bit.

282
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,820
Don't be impulsive.

283
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,950
Picked this up while passing by.

284
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,190
I heard

285
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,940
that this stall is pretty good.

286
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,760
What are you cutting?

287
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,200
Dried tofu.

288
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,640
You're cutting it so neatly.

289
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,110
Let's play tic-tac-toe.

290
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,370
Here.

291
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,270
Your turn. Which spot do you want?

292
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,980
Is this how you're gonna play?

293
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,680
Yes.

294
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,580
I'll go here.

295
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,780
My turn. I choose here.

296
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,570
You can't use that spot.

297
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,100
Why did you eat it?

298
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
Grandma's cooking is amazing.

299
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,800
In the future, we should start a chain.

300
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,960
Let's start with home delivery.

301
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,830
From now on,

302
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,010
we'll be the braised food stall duo!

303
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,910
(Hei)

304
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,670
(No Answer)

305
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,280
(Hei)

306
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,800
(Bai)

307
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,880
What are you doing here?

308
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,720
I...

309
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,540
Shh. Come in first.

310
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,570
Hurry.

311
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,910
Idiot.

312
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,850
Why were you standing in the rain outside?

313
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,080
Take off your clothes.

314
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
Isn't that moving a bit too fast?

315
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,060
Just keep your voice down.

316
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,310
It must hurt a lot.

317
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,840
I owe you an apology.

318
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,230
Okay.

319
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
You give me your apology,

320
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,670
and I'll give you our future.

321
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,320
Be good.

322
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,050
Save this for next time.

323
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,020
We can make mistakes,

324
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,090
(Preview)
We can make mistakes,

326
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,830
but we can't miss out.

What you can't let go of, hold on to
with everything you've got.

329
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,200
What you can't let go of, hold on to
with everything you've got.

330
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
Please approve of our relationship.

331
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,010
I will never accept it.

332
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,660
Then I'll prove it to you through my persistence.

333
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,430
As long as Bai wants me by his side,

334
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,710
I will do everything I can.

335
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,820
Did Hei help you do something?

336
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,780
Grandma!

337
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,830
Stop hitting him!

338
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,670
Who's making a scene in my house?

339
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,610
Hei...

340
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,860
Hei what?

341
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,410
I hope our love lasts a long, long time.
