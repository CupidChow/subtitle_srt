00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,380
You never know what someone's thinking.

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,710
You still don't know how I feel until now.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,360
Senior.

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,160
That's why I'm telling you to be more careful.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,630
Things are unpredictable.

10
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,340
There might be times when I won't be able to help you out.

11
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,310
Yes, Senior. I'll be more careful next time.

12
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,510
Well done with the fan sign event.

13
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,090
Jihoon, thank you so much.

14
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,070
No problem.

15
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,090
And I have something to ask you two.

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,210
Our MV teaser will be released soon.

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,789
To promote it and increase the views,

18
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,450
I was thinking we should make a pledge to the fans.

19
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,430
What do you think?

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,630
Sure. Sounds good.

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,220
Isn't it customary these days to do so?

22
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,560
If we're going to do it,

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,430
let's do something exciting.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,840
What do you think, Eden?

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,690
If Jihoon and Ms. Dajung think so,

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,490
I'm on board.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,840
Usually, they make unique pledges.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,620
What kind of pledge should we make?

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's check out what your fans like.

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,070
After the last interview, there's a lot of mention of water and swimming.

44
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,310
Then how about we make a pledge

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,950
of couple freediving for 5 million views?

46
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,790
What?

47
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,720
That's too...

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,890
Is that dangerous?

49
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
Then what about water skiing?

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,270
Yes, that'd be good.

51
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,840
Are you crazy?

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,390
Let alone swimming, I'm scared to death just looking at water.

53
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,600
Diving?

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,060
Water skiing?

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,280
I can't do it.

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,110
Absolutely not.

57
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,120
Swimming is a bit difficult for me too.

58
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,670
But I doubt we can get 5 million views.

59
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,280
5 million views on a teaser is not an easy feat.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,770
It's practically impossible. But still...

61
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,590
Water skiing is better than diving.

62
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,250
Okay, let's assume it's impossible

63
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,160
and make a pledge of water skiing for 5 million views.

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,350
Eden, are you in?

65
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,060
Of course not.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,420
What if we really get 5 million views?

67
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,280
I can't do it.

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,520
Absolutely not.

69
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,930
Okay.

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,430
Then...

71
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,710
how about this?

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,380
Let's film it first

73
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,910
and report it to CEO Nicki.

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,880
Then, we'll upload it.

thank you so much.

84
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,450
If our MV teaser exceeds 5 million views,

85
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,650
what did you say we were going to do?

86
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,510
I tremble whenever I see water...

87
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,040
I'm trembling even now.

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,820
I tremble whenever I see water,

89
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,310
but I'm going to take on that challenge.

90
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,820
Since you're doing it,

91
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,079
I'll join you too.

92
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,670
But...

93
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,590
what's that challenge?

94
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,090
It's not just snow skiing

95
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,340
but water skiing!

96
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,480
We're going to take on that challenge.

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,520
Challenge!

98
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,040
Challenge.

99
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,230
Come on.

100
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,600
Right.

102
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,020

103
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,880
Down.

104
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,160
Is this right?

105
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,420
CEO Nicki.

106
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,050
I've told you repeatedly,

107
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,930
but I can never do it. Never!

108
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,360
I've also filmed the pledge video for now,

109
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,510
and 5 million views are not an easy feat.

110
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,810
I believe you will make a wise decision.

111
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,450
CEO Nicki.

112
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,790
It's rare for MV teasers to get 5 million views.

113
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,740
We have to assume it's impossible and go with it.

114
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,330
If it's impossible, why are we making such a pledge?

115
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,730
Besides, Eden has expressed his reluctance. Are you out of your mind?

116
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,500
As a manager, you should protect your artists more than anyone else.

117
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,620
No matter how important it is to promote it, how could you plan such a dangerous thing?

118
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,380
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,820
Choi Dajung.

120
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,500
Since you joined the company,

121
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,100
this is your best work yet.

129
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,610
That's right. This is it.

130
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,950
It only took 150 hours, 
breaking the record of the minimum time for a MV teaser to reach 5 million views.

131
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,690
I thought it was impossible to achieve too.

132
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,480
Jihoon, Eden.

133
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,150
Well done.

134
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,550
Well done too, Dajung.

135
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,890
You guys are so awesome.

136
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,230
It's all thanks to your insight.

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,170
So, since it's a promise to the fans,

138
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll try to book a water skiing venue as soon as possible.

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,380
I'll also invite some reporters who are friendly with us.

140
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,090
Okay, a pledge has to be fulfilled,

141
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,890
so let's start preparing for the water skiing date.

142
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,690
Wait.

143
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,540
Why don't we just not plan a schedule

144
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,990
and let this be up to them to decide what to do on this date?

145
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,930
Jihoon will drive,

146
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,380
you'll take selfies and videos together, and upload them directly.

147
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,390
Lion Heart, you'll only get busier from now on.

148
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,810
So take it as a vacation and enjoy it.

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,850
Okay.

150
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380

151
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,830
Who are you?

152
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,820
It's me, Eden.

153
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,900
Are you going to rob the bank with me?

154
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,920
Your outfit...

155
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,950
After all, our identities shouldn't be revealed.

156
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,890
CEO Nicki told us

157
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,000
to take the trip without anyone knowing.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,350
You're really a superstar.

159
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,720
There's no one here.

160
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Are you going for the secret couple concept

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,060
where “We’re just good friends, nothing less and nothing more”?

162
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,680
Let's be casual.

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,250
Let's just go on this trip casually.

164
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,930

165
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,380
Yes?

166
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,030
Why were you here so early?

167
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,030
You were so worried about the water skiing mission that you couldn't sleep too, right?

168
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,580
What's there to worry about?

169
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,150
I was sleeping like a log.

170
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,170
I was so worried all night that I couldn't get any sleep.

171
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,770
But

172
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,020
I feel better after seeing you.

173

[Note: Jihoon gave Eden the Homerun Ball chocolate puffs snack]

184
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,820
You always take care of me.

185
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,090
Thank you.

186
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,130
Since you're driving,

187
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,110
I should have prepared these in advance.

188
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,660
Sorry.

189
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,460
All right.

190
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,090
Superstar Eden!

191
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,500
Shall we set off?

192
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,540
Do you see that taxi?

193
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,770
It's definitely following us.

194
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,490
Don't worry about it. We'll just have to

195
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,250
relax and enjoy the trip as we like.

196
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,470
Senior.

197
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,330
The taxi that was following us disappeared.

198
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,070
It was clearly following us all the way.

199
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,470
That's weird.

200
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,590
It'll probably suddenly show up again soon.

201
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,460
Don't worry about that.

202
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,430
We don't know when photos of us will be taken.

203
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,970
So make sure you're mindful and look cool even when making ugly faces.

204
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,300
Got it?

205
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,010
What? It'll suddenly show up again soon?

206
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,330
A cool ugly face?

207
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,840
What are you mumbling on about?

208
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,590
Aren't you going to get our luggage out?

209
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,010
Yes, Senior.

[With the pianist J]
[Do Hyunbin's Mini Concert]

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,580
Hello, I'm your emcee Do Hyunbin.

213
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,780
Do Hyunbin's Mini Concert today...

214
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,810
Wow. This place is amazing.

215
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,810
We're now at the outdoor stage of Midas J Studio.

216
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,120
Let's welcome our special guest today.

217
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,390
Let's welcome the world-class pianist

218
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,160
and the art director of Midas J Studio,

219
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,780
J.

220
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,090
Hello, J.

221
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,190
Hello.

222
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,220
I'm the pianist J.

223
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,190
Nice to meet you.

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,290
You're one of the most popular artists in the musical, film, and music scenes right now.

225
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,510
You even invited us

226
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,310
and took some time out to perform for us.

227
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,310
Thank you so much.

228
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,150
As far as I know, you're Korean with U.S. citizenship.

229
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,090
Is this your first time in Korea?

230
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,690
I predominantly perform in America and Europe,

231
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,650
so I rarely perform in Korea.

232
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,720
This performance is not my first time in Korea.

233
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,460
About seven years ago,

234
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,050
when the studio opened here,

235
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,950
I came back to perform.

236
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,650
Recently, compared to performing,

237
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,320
you've been more active as an art director.

238
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,700
May I ask

239
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,180
what kind of projects you're working on right now?

240
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm working on an original musical Bap Shim with Korean food as the subject matter, 
which will be showcased soon.

241
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,540
I'm also focusing on developing and producing k-dramas and k-movies
on global streaming platforms.

242
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,690
Next, let's listen to another of J's piano performance.

243
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,870
A number from the musical Bronte, about three sisters

244
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,540
with difficult lives aspiring to be authors,

245
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,210
"The Story, Finally".

246
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,020
The song...

247
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,380
I'll do it again from "Next, let's listen to...".

249
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,970
Next, let's listen to anothoer of J's piano performance.

250
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,200
A number from the musical Bronte, about three sisters

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,050
with difficult lives aspiring to be authors,

252
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,370
"The Story, Finally".

253
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,950
The song will be sung by the musical actress, Go Ra-eun.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,370
The story leaves my hand.

255
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:41,520
What form will it take as it travels this world?

256
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,980
Walking step by step, and falling sometimes.

257
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,740
This song is nice.

258
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,960
Running full force at times too.

259
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,580
Eden, let's go that way.

260
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,280
This way is nearer.

261
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,880
Let's listen to the music for a while more.

262
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,530
Let's hurry and go now.

263
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,570
Why are you so easily distracted?

264
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,050
I guess it can't be found.

265
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,250
No one remembers it.

266
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay, slowly.

267
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay. Slowly. Relax your legs.

268
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,460
Relax. Relax.

269
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,410
Okay. Get up.

270
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,720
Thank you, instructor.

271
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,590
Hyunbin.

272
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,030
What were you doing?

273
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,600
Didn't I tell you to practice a lot before you came?

274
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,500
How could you make a mistake while singing?

275
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,420
Did you see the producer uneasily watching to see if J was annoyed?

276
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,920
Okay, Hyunbin.

277
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,450
I told you I got it, so stop.

278
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,440
Do you know how hard it was for me to get you and J involved?

279
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,410
Of course I know.

280
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,780
That's why I'm doing everything you ask me to.

281
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,070
Okay.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,330
I'm afraid it won't take long before I have something to ask you to do for me.

283
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,740
What is it? Just tell me.

284
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,380
I have to film now. I'll talk to you later.

285
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,720
Should I wait for you?

286
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,180
No, you should go back first. Be careful of the cars.

287
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,760
By the way, J...

288
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,540
I think I've seen him somewhere.

289
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,050
He seems familiar.

290
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,920
Senior, why do you look like that?

291
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,980
It's because you're afraid of the water, right?

292
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,410
Senior.

293
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,060
No, I'm fine.

294
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,390
Now, put on your skis and get on the boat.

295
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,400
Hey.

296
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,970
Smile.

297
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,900
Be mindful of your facial expressions.

298
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Can't you see they're taking pictures up there?

299
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,790
But the fans up there really didn't intrude at all.

300
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,730
To be honest, I was a little worried.

301
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,910
They're not trying to get in the way anyway.

302
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,190
Should we give them

303
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,790
an exclusive social media scoop?

304
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,660
Exclusive social media scoop?

305
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,740
Now that we've had some rest, let's get to work.

306
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,910

[In the next episode]

308
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,740
Well, instead of calling me Senior...

309
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,630
Eden.

310
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,910
Yes?

311
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,070
Jihoon had a tough time because of you.

312
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:21,630
What?

313
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,150
Who drove the car?

314
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,220
Jihoon. Can I talk to you privately?

315
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,770
How did this happen?

316
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,690
We're not just close,

317
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,900
but inseparable.

318
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,210
The person who I'm inseparable with now is...
