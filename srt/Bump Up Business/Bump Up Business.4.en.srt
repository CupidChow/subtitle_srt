But... it was a love that couldn't be fulfilled.

97

As Lion Heart members, you're temporarily banned from drinking.

189
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,980
You're going to debut soon. Take good care of yourselves.

190
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,590
Jihoon. Let's talk privately.

191
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,340
Oh, right.

192
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,540
Thank you for your hard work yesterday.

193
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,590
Especially the ice cream kiss. That was brilliant.

194
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,790
By the way, who drank in broad daylight?

195
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,610
Something's off.

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,710
You might feel uncomfortable but it's about Do Hyunbin.

197
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,050
You know his Mini Concert is very popular these days, right?

198
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,280
The show sent an invitation to us

199
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,850
and it was even done by Do Hyunbin personally.

200
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,780
How did this happen?

201
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,310
You know our situation.

202
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,630
Yes, I know.

203
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,830
But in this industry, you'll run into each other sooner or later.

204
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,080
It's also a pity to just give up the chance to be on that show.

205
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,910
Senior.

206
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,560
Is something wrong?

207
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,740
Why did CEO Nicki...

208
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,070
It's nothing.

209
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,460
I'll tell you later.

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,660
Okay.

211
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,900
Also, thank you for yesterday.

212
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,630
For what?

213
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,370
I was drunk yesterday so I don't remember anything.

214
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,260
But I think you drove me home.

215
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,740
And... what's with the necklace?

216
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,860
I didn't make any mistake yesterday, did I?

217
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,050
You...

218
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,800
don't remember anything?

219
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,170
Well...

220
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,570
I remember up until talking about my first love.

221
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,920
Gosh.

222
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,140
No wonder.

223
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,790
Don't drink anymore from now on.

224
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,930
What?

225
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,800
What's going on?

226
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,600
Darn it.

227
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,880
Senior.

228
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,500
Senior.

229
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,080
What did you bring?

230
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,490
Did I tell you about this?

231
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,090
You never texted me in private,

232
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,940
so I went through all your interviews.

233
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,790
When you're in a bad mood and want to release my stress,

234
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,060
you would dance, and have a Guinness Whopper burger

235
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,630
and a milkshake.

236
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,790
Okay.

237
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,500
Thanks to you, I feel much better.

238
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,120
Thank you, Eden.

239
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,990
That's a relief.

240
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,410
But... we shouldn't eat junk food during our promotional period.

241
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,260
Oh.

242
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,300
Then what should we do with this?

243
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,260
Well,

244
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,930
we can just share it.

245
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,540
How is it?

246
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,710
Isn't it good?

247
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,310
Thank you.

248
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,430
It's delicious.

249
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,450
The first performance of two men who burst onto the scene.

250
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,470
Here's a song

251
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,030
from the lovable duo Lion Heart.

252
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,440
[On Air]

253
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,430
Lion Heart's Evergreen.

254
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,590
Let's meet them now.

255
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,020
You're my evergreen.

256
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,370
Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

257
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,080
You're like an evergreen tree.

258
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,690
You're my evergreen.

259
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,540
Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

260
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,210
I'll be the shade that keeps you cool.

261
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,930
This moment is shining.

262
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,020
You're my only one, my evergreen.

263
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,930
Lion Heart, you two are so cool.

264
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,120
You did really well.

265
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,380
That was awesome.

266
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,060
Senior, thank you for your hard work.

267
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,120
You too, Ms. Dajung.

268
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,880
It's your first time on stage after your debut

269
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,180
but you didn't get nervous and did well.

270
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,220
Thank you.

271
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,580
Gong Jihoon.

272
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,800
I missed you.

273
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,320
Congratulations on your second debut.

274
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,180
Why are you here?

275
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,080
You're still so cold.

276
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,750
Your body is the same too.

277
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,510
Hello, Senior Do Hyunbin.

278
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm a huge fan of yours.

279
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,810
I saw you filming at Midas J Studio last time.

280
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,480
My name is Kang Eden.

281
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,770
Nice to meet you.

282
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,480
Kang Eden.

283
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,670
Okay.

284
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,130
Isn't it tiring working with my Jihoon?

285
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,200
My Jihoon is a bit difficult to deal with.

286
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,890
Have you drank together before?

287
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,210
When he drinks, he gets harder to deal with.

288
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,160
Jihoon.

289
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
Do you remember those times?

290
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,880
You called me and complained whenever you were drunk.

291
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,960
Don't you remember?

292
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,150
You two must have been really close.

293
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,810
We weren't just close,

294
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,950
but inseparable.

295
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,100
Inseparable?

296
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,320
The person I'm inseparable with now...

297
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,770
is Kang Eden.

298
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,280
Senior. What do you mean?

299
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,550
Are you saying that we aren't inseparable?

300
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,700
That's not what I meant...

301
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,540
You two didn't forget about your appearance on my show, right?

302
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,530
Eden, see you then.

303
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,490
Okay.

304
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,810
Jihoon, see you again.

305
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,730
Goodbye.

306
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,810
We're going to appear on Do Hyunbin's Mini Concert?

307
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,740
That's great.

308
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,260
[In the next episode]

309
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,950
Are you two really close?

310
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,000
That rumor...

311
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,310
Because he's my dearest younger brother.

312
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,940
What would I have done without you?

313
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,980
Thank you for your hard work too.

314
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,050
Really?

315
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,720
Of course.

316
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,710
He's just my type.

317
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,730
Help!

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,940
What happened?

319
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,990
Why don't you see him another time?

320
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,700
Yeah?
