00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,760
Good morning, Eden.

6
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,500
Did you have a good dream?

7
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,010
Good morning. Dong-gun.

8
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,450
Hi.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,250
What good dream?

10
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,120
We all practiced hard together,

11
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,740
but I'm debuting first. I'm sorry.

12
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,090
Don't be sorry.

13
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,080
We agreed to congratulate each other

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,800
whenever someone gets to debut.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,520
Yes.

16
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,970
Congratulations on your debut.

17
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,020
Thank you.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,759
Well, to be honest, I'm congratulating you,

19
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,170
but I do feel a little jealous inside.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,009
Anyway, do your best.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
I'll catch up with you soon.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm next.

23

As your senior, I'm rooting for you.

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,220
Congratulations.

Anyway, Dong-gun's always saying stuff he doesn't mean.

26

Hey, it's Senior Jihoon.

-Shh.

Even though

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,030
people say Jihoon is past his prime,

34
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,900
he still has such a glowing aura...

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,890
Hush.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,290
He's so rude.

37
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,190
It'll be exhausting to be in the same group as that jerk.

38
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,270
He's a senior after all. How can you call him a jerk?

39
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,800
Maybe he just doesn't want to be disturbed while working out.

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,730
Our Eden is so kind.

41
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,190
I hope you become partners with a senior like Gong Jihoon.

42
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,060
Jihoon and Eden in the same group?

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,720
That's too much.

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,130
Why are you cursing me in the morning on the first day of my debut?

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,050
Hush.

The first person I'll introduce is Kang Eden, 23 years old.

61
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,850
In this member selection of Lion Heart with 3 rounds

62

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,530
popularity with the general public, and so on,

64
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,890
he got the highest scores in all aspects.

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,770
Additionally, he lived abroad for a long time

66
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,390
and can speak fluent English,

67
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,510
so he's globally competitive.

68

As such, Eden is deemed as an all-rounded artist

69
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,920
who is most suited to the image of this project group Lion Heart

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,580

Gong Jihoon, 26 years old.

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,670
He has already debuted once before.

76
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,440
A few years ago,

77
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,810
he became popular with his good looks and great singing skills.

78
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,409
Also, he once formed a band and actively promoted

79
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,090
with the current top artist Do Hyunbin.

80
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,700
As the leader of this project group,

81
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,100
we believe he can be the pillar of Lion Heart.

82
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,940
Hence, he was selected as a member.

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,390
But as we all know,

84
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,950
due to several scandals,

85
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,530
Jihoon's not as popular as before.

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,950
Okay, let's get to the point.

87
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,610
You two will become partners

88
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,240

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,140
Wait.

90
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,410
Are Jihoon and I going to be in the same group?

91
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,610
Is there a problem?

92
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,160
No, not really.

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,150
It's just that... Jihoon has already debuted before but I'm a rookie.

94
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,990
Is it appropriate to debut together?

95
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,720
That's why you two are placed together.

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,690
Jihoon can take this opportunity to restore his image

97
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,920
and it'll be easier for you to gain popularity.

98
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,040
But...

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,790
Eden, do you have an issue with being in the same group as Jihoon?

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,670
No, but...

101
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,860
Then, let me tell you the direction of this project group.

102
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,010
Lion Heart is a rare male duo.

103
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,830
So we clearly stand out in terms of that.

104
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,180
The problem is the potential of going viral.

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,080
I'd like to suggest the Business Gay Performance concept for Lion Heart.

106
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,110
Are you saying... I have to be gay?

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,700
Don't you understand what "performance" means?

108
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,510
CEO Nicki, that's not what I mean.

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,430
I just don't think homosexuality should be used as a concept.

110
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,240
I'm curious too.

111
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,030
Are there any successful cases through the Business Gay Performance concept?

112
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,100
Of course.

113
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,120
JNK Entertainment even developed a department just for it.

114
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,950
There are several successful cases, including those overseas.

115
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,020
As for the marketing concept and execution process,

116
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,680
we're already discussing them with external experts.

117
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,780
So I hope you'd regard the success rate as high.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,170
In that case, I...

119
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,540
What was your name again?

120
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,560
You're Eden, right?

121
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,500
If he's okay with it, I'll try it.

122
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,180
Good. What about you, Eden?

123
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,380
I...

124
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,390
Thanks, Eden.

125
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,460
But to be honest, I...

126
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,900
The company has deliberated upon this concept before we decided on it,

127
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,410
so I hope you'd trust the company and follow the company's decision.

128
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,530
If you really can't accept it,

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,950
then tell me now

130
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,630
so that I can consider other plans.

131
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,050
I'll do it too.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,980
I'm counting on you from now on.

133
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,710
Me too.

134
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,900
This is what you mean, right?

135
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,780
It's easy.

136
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,150
Get closer.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,320
Get closer.

138
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,820
One, two.

139
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,570
Okay.

140
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,080
Wait. Wait.

141
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,210
This won't do.

142
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,350
I don't see an ounce of chemistry between the two.

143
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,880
This awkward vibe is not what we want.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,540
Then what should we do?

145
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,760
It's okay. I'll take the lead from now on.

146
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,170
Okay.

147
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,340
Open your eyes.

148
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,640
Okay. Good.

149
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,480
Good.

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,370
-Thank you for your hard work. 
-You're welcome.

151
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,450
Did you photograph that too?

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,710
Jihoon suddenly hugged Eden.

153
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,120
I was so shocked that my jaw dropped.

154
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,680
He sure is professional.

155
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,970
Good job.

156
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,210
The photo shoot turned out well.

157
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,450
Look, there's already a lot of buzz.

158
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,810
There are also many comments.

159
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,150
Of course, there's still some negativity towards Jihoon.

160
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,250
Bad publicity is still publicity.

161
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,100
We're off to a good start.

162
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,150
Business Gay Performance.

163
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,990
I knew this concept would work.

164
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,250
As the members of Lion Heart, how do you feel?

165
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,960
I'm happy, of course.

166
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,090
It's all thanks to Senior Gong Jihoon.

167
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,390
Well, me too.

168
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,130
Good.

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,380
Eden, even though you're a rookie,

170
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,250
the public has taken notice of you.

171
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,190
With this momentum,

172
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,150
we'll announce the release date of Lion Heart's album.

173
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
So...

174
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
I hope you can maintain the Business Gay Performance concept outside of work too.

175
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,110
Outside of work too?

176
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,340
I know it's a demanding request,

177
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,730
but you know how quick-witted fans are these days.

178
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,770
That's right.

179
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,570
Even now, they're saying that you're trying to profit off a gay concept,

180
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,310
that Gong Jihoon still hasn't come to his senses,

181
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,890
that they feel so bad for Eden because of Gong Jihoon...

182
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,360
I was just reading the comments.

183
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,500
Jihoon, I'm sorry.

184
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,230
It's fine. I don't care about those comments.

185
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,550
Besides, they're true.

186
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,080
As expected, you're a broad-minded artist.

187
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,590
That's why, to silence those critiques,

188
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,740
you two must act like you're really close.

189
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,300
Have meals and try to spend more time together.

190
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,280
It would be better if you really become close in time.

191
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,330
Of course I'd like to get along with Jihoon.

192
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,500
But having to pretend all the time...

193
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,440
We just need to get along well like we belong to the same group.

194
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,900
Am I right, CEO Nicki?

195
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,060
Yes.

196
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,320
Okay, Jihoon.

197
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,550
I'm counting on you from now on.

198
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,550
Hey, Kang Eden.

199
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,840
What do you like?

200
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,230
Me?

201
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,120
What are you referring to exactly?

202
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,650
For sports, I like basketball and soccer.

203
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,950
For food, since I lived in America,

204
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,800
I like spicy rice cakes and kimchi stew.

205
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,080
-Oh, right. I also like spicy hot pot...
-Okay. Enough.

206
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,510
Text me when you've come to a conclusion.

207
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,460
Okay.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,040
In order to promote together in the future,

209
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,430
we need to know everything about each other.

210
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,340
Also, since CEO Nicki wants us to be close,

211
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,750
shouldn't we know more about each other?

212
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,840
Senior.

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,280
But, don't you hate it?

214
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,630
Between men...

215
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,740
Not really. I don't hate it.

216
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,870
Because it's just work.

217
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,350
Right, it's just work.

218
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,390
-Jihoon! Eden!
-Jihoon! Eden!

219
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,760
So, don't worry too much.

220
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,610
Okay.

221
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,720
Eden.

222
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,270
Jihoon, what are you doing at my house?

223
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,330
Because you wanted it.

224
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,070
Did I invite you here? I don't remember.

225
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,080
But why are you dressed like this?

226
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,960
Do you want me to say it again?

227
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,200
Because you wanted it.

228
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,240
[In the next episode]

229
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:49,850
What happened to your face?

230
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,440
Anyway, I don't feel the best.

231
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,460
You're my evergreen...

232
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,240
Senior.

234
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,820
I heard that Eden is becoming popular with that rude Gong Jihoon.

235
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,160
Kang Eden is piggybacking on Jihoon's popularity.

236
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,030
Kang Eden!

237
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,450
Yes.

238
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,780
Jihoon, you care for Eden like he's your lover.

239
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,720
About earlier...

240
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,580
You're grateful, right?

241
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,040
Senior.
