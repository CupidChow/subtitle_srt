[Episode 7]

4
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,650
You've finally won the first place on Music Start. Congratulations.

5
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,380
Congratulations. I knew you would win.

6
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,990
It still feels like a dream.

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,690
It's still early to be happy.

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,490
You said you like that pianist J, right?

9
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,900
The pianist and music director?

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,780
He's the heir of Midas J Studio

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,930
and the only adopted son 
of the American streaming platform MacGuffin's major shareholder.

12
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,460
Really?

13
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,370
J wants to cast you as the main lead for MacGuffin's new production.

14
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,690
I'm sure you all know that J is the chief producer and chief music director

15
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,000
of MacGuffin's original productions.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,539
Why does such a big shot want me?

17
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,600
Maybe he thinks highly of your potential

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,539
and the training process and system of our ES Entertainment?

19
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,530
In any case, they want to see you as soon as possible,

20
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,670
so I'll contact them to set a date.

21
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,090
Let's blow out the candles first.

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,700
Okay. I'll put the candles on the cake.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Congratulations. That's great news.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,920
Thank you, Senior.

25
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,450
J, you play the piano so well.

26
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,400
Hello.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,660
I'm Nicki, CEO of ES Entertainment.

28
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,200
Hello, I'm J.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,829
And this is Kang Eden from Lion Heart.

30
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,860
Greet him.

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,470
Hello. I'm Lion Heart's Kang Eden.

32
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,240
Eden, don't you remember me? 
I miss you so bad. This is me, J.

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,950
J?

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,480
Do you know how much I've been looking for you?

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,130
Wait, do you know me?

36
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:20,290
You're joking, right, Eden? Come on. 
Don't you remember me? I'm getting a little upset.

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,510
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Where have we met before?

39
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,610
What a relief. While Eden became a total star, he's still the polite guy we always knew.

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,280
No way...

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,380
Yup, It is the J from Santiago.

42
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,540
I'm glad you two already know each other.

43
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,010
He was a really close friend of mine when I was in America.

44
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,070
Friends? More like first love to me.

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,620
I really didn't know it was you.

46
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,930
You've grown taller and more handsome.

47
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,430
You played the piano well too when you were young,

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,780
but I never once thought you are the pianist J.

49
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so glad to see you again, my childhood friend.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,310
But what's "childhood friend" in English?

51
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,540
Well, a childhood friend is a childhood friend.

52
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,120
J, do you come to Korea often?

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,220
I'm in America, Korea, and Europe for four months each in a year.

54
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,300
I'm here longer this time because of the drama.

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,960
I see.

56
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,020
To be honest, because of today's audition,

57
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,560
I haven't eaten anything since lunch yesterday, so I'm hungry.

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,590
J, what do you want to eat?

59
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,930
Tell me. I'll treat you to anything.

60
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,330
There's something I want to eat indeed.

61
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,150
Are you really treating me to anything?

62
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,040
Why spicy rice cakes?

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,250
I said I'd treat you to something more expensive.

64
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,230
No, this is what I'm craving the most.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,040
Eden, do you remember?

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,360
Your grandma used to make us a huge pot of spicy rice cakes.

67
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,820
We used to eat it up so hurriedly.

68
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,130
Come on. That's just a simple fare.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,520
But I do miss my grandma.

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,000
When I said I wanted to be a singer,

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,430
she was the only one who supported me.

72
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,950
My mom loves me like her biological son,

73
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,190
but she can't master the cooking of Korean food.

74
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,100
Then let's go eat Korean food whenever we're free.

75
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,420
Okay. Don't worry.

76
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,670
So I'm going to stay here for a long time this time.

77
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,670
I'll also eat delicious food with you every day.

78
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,870
With me every day?

79
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,320
Come on, you're busier than me.

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,610
Okay, fine.

81
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,460
Let's meet often whenever we have time then.

82
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,830
I'm not busy.

83
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,620
You're a member of the most popular group Lion Heart, and you're Eden.

84
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,530
We casted you in our drama.

85
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,860
Nothing is more important than this.

86
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,210
But how did you recognize me?

87
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,500
There was a chance that I wasn't the person you're looking for.

88
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,920
Well, when I saw you on TV,

89
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,510
I recognized you at first sight.

90
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,930
Well, for some reason, when I hear your piano performances,

91
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,270
I feel at ease.

92
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,370
It felt familiar.

93
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,190
But I'm still a rookie.

94
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,740
If you casted me for the drama because of our childhood ties,

95
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,230
it's a bit burdensome.

96
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,460
Eden.

97
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,240
You know my dad is American.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,610
I learned business from him since I was young.

99
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,080
This decision was made with the casting director

100
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,470
because we recognized your star quality and potential.

101
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,360
So you don't have to feel burdened.

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,020
Okay.

103
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,310
Jihoon.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,860
You're early.

105
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,190
Yes, I just came a while ago.

106
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,070
Did something happen? You seem to be in a bad mood.

107
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,690
What do you mean?

108
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,150
Nothing's wrong.

109
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,290
You have to start preparations for the drama

110
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,580
and I have my solo activities too.

111
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,940
It'll be better if we don't interfere in each other's matters.

112
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,790
Don't say that.

113
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,800
In any case, Lion Heart comes first.

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,580
Lion Heart...

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,930
So our relationship was nothing more than the Business Gay Performance concept.

116
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,180
That's not what I meant.

117
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,350
I meant our relationship is the priority.

118
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,470
Our relationship is the priority...

119
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,920
Is that really true?

120
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
The J you've been looking for is back...

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,930
Jihoon, what's wrong with you?

122
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,460
What did I do?

123
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,110
You told me that.

124
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,870
You liked J and that he was your first love.

125
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,250
How can there be first love between men?

126
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,330
It's all a misunderstanding.

127
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,520
Between men...

128
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,530
A misunderstanding?

129
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,730
Also, I was casted for MacGuffin's original drama

130
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,059
by the casting director.

131
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,049
You're really...

132
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,930
so innocent that you're a fool.

133
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,670
What?

134
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,160
A fool?

135
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,110
Give me a minute.

136
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,450
Well, it's nothing else.

137
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,160
I'm thinking of halting Lion Heart's activities temporarily.

138
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,890
Eden and Jihoon, I think

139
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,130
it'll be better for you two to go solo for a while.

140
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,610
There's no other special reason.

141
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,220
If there's no special reason,

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,790
why do you have to break up Lion Heart?

143
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,500
I agree.

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,140
Jihoon's working harder than before

145
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,940
and Lion Heart's international influence is also rising rapidly.

146
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,490
Why do you want to halt their activities?

147
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,690
Why are you like this too?

148
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,010
I'm not trying to separate them.

149
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,570
I just think it's time for them to recalibrate.

150
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,410
Eden's also going to be in MacGuffin's original drama

151
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,980
so I think it'd be good for him to focus on the drama.

152
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,080
CEO Nicki.

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,110
Of course I'll focus on the drama.

154
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,040
But I can manage my activities with Jihoon simultaneously.

155
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,590
Also, MacGuffin didn't state that I have to halt all other activities.

156
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,640
If that's the case,

157
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,530
I'll try talking to J about it.

158
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,070
What exactly are you going to talk to J about?

159
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,650
Are you that thoughtless?

160
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,440
Do you really not know the importance of this opportunity to you

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,680
or are you playing dumb?

162
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,790
Are you really a fool?

163
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,110
-CEO Nicki.
-Stop it!

164
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,580
You're going overboard.

165
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,960
Eden. Jihoon.

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,560
I stand by what I said.

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,800
Just understand that this is the best choice for you two.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,080
End of discussion.

169
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,990
I'll get going too.

170
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,540
Let's be honest.

171
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,770
CEO Nikki. You know about my relationship with Jihoon.

172
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,050
J.

173
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,900
You should tell CEO Nicki about how you feel about Eden.

174
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,260
Sure. It's true.

175
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,320
My feelings for him haven't changed.

176
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,550
Go on.

177
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,910
Since you've confirmed J's feelings for Eden,

178
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,490
why don't we do this?

179
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,130
It's simple.

180
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,250
Let's try to get what we all want.

181
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,270
First of all, J and I will try to get back our lovers.

182
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,010
As for you, you'll get fame and fortune through J

183
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,380
and make Eden into an international star.

184
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,070
What do you think?

185
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,460
Jihoon, wait.

186
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
Listen to me.

187
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,620
This is the first time I'm hearing of this too.

188
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,500
Eden.

189
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,830
You don't have to try so hard for Lion Heart.

190
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,520
You also don't need to be called a fool by others.

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,230
I'm fine.

192
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,220
Sorry for making you worry.

193
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,970
No, it's my fault.

194
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,110
What? Why?

195
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,270
I was too selfish and misunderstood you.

196
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,850
This is my fault.

197
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,630
From now on, if it's not for business,

198
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,000
you don't have to force yourself to be with me.

199
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry for everything.

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,190
Jihoon, wait.

201
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,070
What do you mean by that?

202
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,940
Eden.

203
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,210
J, what are you doing here?

204
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,280
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

205
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,970
I came because I missed you.

206
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,920
There's a restaurant I want to visit

207
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,100
and also have something about the drama I want to talk about.

208
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,680
I see. Hang on.

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,060
Let's go now.

210
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,430
J.

211
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,740
Why are you drinking alone pitifully?

212
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,710
Did you drink a lot?

213
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,080
What are you doing here?

214
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,590
How did you know I was here?

215
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,500
I'll get going. Drink yourself.

216
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,270
Wait, sit down first.

217
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,890
You should listen to what I have to say before you go.

218
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,710
I have nothing to say to you.

219
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,550
I got it, so just take a look at this.

220
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,920
What do you want me to do?

221
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,420
What else?

222
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,820
I want you to face the reality.

223
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,270
Nicki is hooked on J, the gold mine,

224
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,610
and no longer cares about Lion Heart.

225
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,650
So you're just a burden to Eden now.

226
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,110
What did you say? Are you done?

227
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,730
Calm down.

228
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,930
This is the reality.

229
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,680
What can you do for Eden?

230
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,980
Love?

231
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,060
That's also something you can do when you're rich and powerful.

232
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,720
Jihoon.

233
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,690
I won't ask to get back together.

234
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,350
I just want you to act like you did when you first debuted,

235
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,020
and work and get along as friends with you.

236
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,800
Look.

237
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Director Choi has been looking to work with us for a show.

238
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,570
Jihoon.

239
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,070
Jihoon.

240
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,500
Senior, you misunderstood.

241
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,010
Actually, Senior... no, Bro,

242
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,820
I... I love...

243
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,060
That's not it.

244
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,980
I'm so nervous.

245
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,460
[In the next episode]

246
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,370
Are you able to contact Eden?

247
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,740
I think I really fell in love with him.

248
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,630
I don't want to hear things like "thank you".

249
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,020
It would be better if it was something like "I love you".

250
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,430
Can you handle the consequences?

251
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,740
It doesn't matter.

252
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,640
What are you two doing?

253
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,360
You even use separate waiting rooms.

254
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Has our Business Gay Performance plan

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,580
come to an end too?

256
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,820
Come to an end?
