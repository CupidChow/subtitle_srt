Eden.

[Episode 2]

6
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,080
When I close my eyes, I think of you.

7
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,170
I don't want to wake up from my dream.

8
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,550
When I open the window, it seems like your voice is drifting towards me with the wind

9
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,710
and waking me up.

10
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,560
What's wrong?

11
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,030
What happened to your face? Did you drink?

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,150
No way.

13
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,670
Today is the first day of recording. There's no way you'd drink.

14
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,520
I didn't. It's not like I didn't get a good sleep but...

15
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,960
Anyway, I don't feel the best.

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,210
If CEO Nicki finds out,

17
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,620
she'll berate me for not managing you guys properly.

18
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,410
So before your official debut,

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,220
you must prioritize your health and appearance management, okay?

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,020
Yes, I understand. Don't worry.

21
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,090
Jihoon should almost be done. Head to the recording studio now.

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay, after you.

23
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,120
You're my evergreen. Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,030
You're like an evergreen tree.

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,160
You're my evergreen. Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

26
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,970
Because you wanted it.

27
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,700
I'll be the shade that keeps you cool.

28
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,820
You're my evergreen. Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

29
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,660
Perfect timing.

30
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,730
It's your turn to record your part.

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,190
Okay.

32
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,360
How oh how did I become so obsessed with you?

33
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,520
Fine, I'll look for you. Wandering aimlessly like a child.

34
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,050
I want to stay in the season that resembles you so that you can see me.

35
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,540
You're my evergreen...

36
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,370
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,950
Fine, I'll look for you. Wandering aimlessly like a child.

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,820
I want to stay in the season that resembles you so that you can see me.

39
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,840
You're my evergreen...

40
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

41
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,350
I'll do it again. I'm sorry.

42
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,110
Never let these moments be tarnished.

43
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,780
I'll hold on to the memories and never let go.

44
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,120
Never let these moments be tarnished

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,010
[I'm not a picky eater.
Maybe it's because I grew up in America
that I like Korean food more.]

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,730
I'll hold on to the memories and never let go.

47
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,890
It's finally over.

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,360
How many times did I re-record it?

50
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,560
Good job.

51
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,410
Here. You said this is your favorite drink.

52
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,610
Drink it.

53
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,700
Thank you.

54
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,300
Is something wrong?

55
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,940
What? No. How can that be?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,910
Then what's wrong with you?

57
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,800
You never make mistakes.

58
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,240
If something's wrong...

59
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,530
No, well...

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,610
Did I make you uncomfortable?

61
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,630
No, that's not it.

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,510
I'm sorry. I just saw you as a little brother.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,550
I was careless.

64
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,240
You said you hated such intimacy, right?

65
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,260
In any case, if something's wrong,

66
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,900
you must let Ms. Dajung know.

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,870
You don't look well. I'll get going.

68
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,790
Senior.

69
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,680
You misunderstood.

70
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,090
I just had a bad dream.

71
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,210
I didn't get a good sleep. That's all.

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,380
That's a relief.

73
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,130
Yes.

74
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,430
But what kind of dream did you have?

75
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,480
I didn't dream of anyone.

76
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,090
What?

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,290
I didn't ask you who you dreamed of.

78
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,360
Did you dream of someone?

79
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,600
No.

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,480
Did I appear in your dreams?

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
No, well...

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,970
Did I do something with you in the dream?

83
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,170
I told you I didn't dream of anyone.

84
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,680
I’ll get going.

85
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,470
Hey, Woosung.

86
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,830
Did you hear about Kang Eden?

87
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,100
He seems to be doing well and quite busy.

88
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,270
I know.

89
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,230
I heard he's getting popular with that rude Gong Jihoon.

90
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,890
I envy him.

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,850
He's so lucky.

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
Anyway, thanks to that rude Gong Jihoon,

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,730
there were so many fans gathered in front of the company. Did you see that?

94
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,940
Kang Eden is just piggybacking on Jihoon's popularity.

95
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,750
Isn't it the case for all rookies?

96
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,920
To be honest, there's nothing attractive about Kang Eden.

97
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,380
His popularity is all thanks to Gong Jihoon.

98
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,500
Still, how could you be so harsh?

99
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm the bad guy again, right?

100
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,750
You are a bad guy.

101
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,580
What?

102
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,010
I'm just kidding.

103
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,750
Forget it. I'm not talking to you anymore.

104
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,050
Are you angry?

105
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,680
Let me buy you ice cream.

106
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
Today's interview

107
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,630
will be livestreaming on both the newspaper's channel and our company's channel.

108
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,010
I've mentioned that before, right?

109
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,840
And the fact that the reporter is very cranky.

110
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,700
Be cautious with your words so that they can't twist your words.

111
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,910
Especially Eden.

112
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,390
Don't fall for his subtle manipulation when he questions you.

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,530
Phrase your answers cautiously.

114
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,260
Eden. Kang Eden!

115
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,780
Yes.

116
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,970
Got it, Ms. Dajung.

117
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,380
What's wrong with him? He's making me anxious.

118
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,960
Jihoon, long time no see.

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't tell me you're still upset

120
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,159
about the article I wrote about you before, right?

121
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,659
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,020
That was a long time ago.

123
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,230
That's not important.

124
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,090
I hope you'd write this article about Lion Heart in a positive light.

125
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,190
Especially about our Eden.

126
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,050
Is it because of your Business Gay Performance concept?

127
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,420
You're so sweet to Eden, like a lover.

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,620
Am I?

129
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,870
With regards to Lion Heart's song Evergreen,

130
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,540
even though only a debut teaser has been released,

131
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,650
the reception is good.

132
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,020
Jihoon, do you think it's because of you

133
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,890
or because of your lover-like chemistry?

134
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,410
To be honest, this is my second time debuting,

135
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:25,670
so, at first, I was very worried about what the fans would think of my chemistry with Eden.

136
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,130
Fortunately, we have similar personalities and views on music.

137
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,880
We also share the same hobbies and are quite similar.

138
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,840
That's how we became close quickly.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,890
As such, our teamwork improved.

140
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,710
I think that's why our fans like us.

141
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,700
Conversely, there are people who say that you two aren't actually close

142
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,620
or that you're just trying to profit from the Business Gay Performance concept.

143
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,470
What do you think about that?

144
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,320
Could Eden answer this time?

145
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,020
Well...

146
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,960
Do you think we don't look close?

147
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,530
We're actually very close.

148
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,750
And to me, Jihoon is like a role model.

149
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,250
When we first formed our duo,

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,570
we promised each other

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,390
that we'd always be honest and sincere to our fans.

152
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,670
Gong Jihoon is being sacrificed to launch the debut of Eden.

153
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,740
What are your thoughts on that?

154
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,640
Anyway, thanks to that rude Gong Jihoon,

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,130
there were many fans gathered in front of the company. Did you see that?

156
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,740
Kang Eden is just piggybacking on Jihoon's popularity.

157
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,850
To be honest, there's nothing attractive about Kang Eden.

158
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,260
His popularity is all thanks to Gong Jihoon.

159
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,710
How can that be?

160
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,930
It's not Eden who's using Gong Jihoon,

161
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,120
but Gong Jihoon who's using Eden.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Even if it's not to the extent of using him,

163
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,670
I'm indeed benefiting from my association with him.

164
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,720
Without him,

165
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,120
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to step on stage again.

166
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,750
You know about my past image too.

167
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
Senior.

168
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,630
I heard that unlike your appearance, you're a master of many sports.

169
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,740
I spent my teen years in America,

170
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,350
so I liked to play sports with my schoolmates.

171
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,340
They were just hobbies.

172
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,010
But I heard that if you participate in this idol track or swimming competition,

173
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,510
you can get first place.

174
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,110
That's absolutely false.

175
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,840
Actually, I nearly drowned when I was young.

176
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,290
Not to mention swimming, I can't even go near bodies of water.

177
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,100
Jihoon, what about you? What sports are you good at?

178
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,060
I know how to play several sports,

179
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,410
but I haven't learned how to swim yet.

180
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,860
Even this is something I have in common with Eden.

181
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,980
-See you again.
-Okay.

182
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,430
Senior, thank you for the good work.

183
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,750
You too.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,090
Senior, wait.

185
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,170
Just now...

186
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,450
You're grateful, right?

187
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,640
Yes.

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,350
You heard that the reporter is that kind of person.

189
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,120
In the future, you should be more well-prepared.

190
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,080
There are plenty of reporters who are worse than him.

191
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,920
Okay, Senior.

192
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,730
And about what the other trainees said just now,

193
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,670
don't take it to heart.

194
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,970
They said that because they're envious.

195
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,040
Did you hear that too?

196
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,480
I just happened to hear it.

197
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,090
Let me repeat myself.

198
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,310
You got here with your skills.

199
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,830
Don't mind what others say.

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,400
Thank you, Senior.

201
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,240
Okay. Then...

202
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,130
let me ask you a question.

203
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,080
What is it?

204
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,450
The person you dreamed of...

205
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,730
was me, right?

206
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
Well...

207
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,310
Yes.

208
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,220
What did I do in your dream?

209
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,020
Nothing.

210
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,450
Why do you keep asking?

211
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,590
Because it's troubling me.

212
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,820
What?

213
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,000
It's troubling me because it's troubling you.

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,090
We're in the same group.

215
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,810
Our debut is imminent.

216
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Would it make sense for you to be uncomfortable around me?

217
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,270
You're right. I'm really fine.

218
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,270
Senior, I'll get going then.

219
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,190
Hey, Eden.

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,860
Yes?

221
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,130
Nothing. Bye.

222
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,190
Eden, why's your face so stiff?

223
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,630
It's just a pre-debut fan sign event.

224
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,330
There aren't that many people here either.

225
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,470
Don't worry too much.

226
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,660
Okay.

227
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,680
Thank you for waiting.

228
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,160
Lion Heart's pre-debut fan sign event will commence now.

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,440
If you want an autograph,

230
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,610
please come up orderly and stay in line.

231
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,340
Excessive physical contact with the artists

232
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,070
will be restrained by the staff.

233
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,840
You may come up front now.

234
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,340
Hello.

235
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,110
Jihoon, do you remember me?

236
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,260
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

237
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,690
It's really been a while.

238
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,610
You were at every fan sign event, right?

239
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,200
You didn't forget me.

240
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,420
You've become more handsome.

241
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,580
Thank you.

242
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,500
Your name is Yoon...

243
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,260
Jihoon, I'm Yoon-na.

244
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,760
Yes, your name is Yoon-na.

245
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,820
I remember I said that I'd treat you to a meal when you turn 18, right?

246
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,670
Jihoon, you remember!

247
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,850
Hi, Eden.

248
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,410
Hello.

249
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,770
I became a fan right after I saw your photoshoot.

250
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,050
I look forward to your debut.

251
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,200
Thank you.

252
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,400
What’s your name?

253
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,410
My name is Kim Yeji.

254
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,420
Okay.

255
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,470
Hello.

256
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,130
I asked for a leave at work today.

257
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,630
Really? Thank you.

258
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,230
To become handsome like you,

259
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,420
I started working out too.

260
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,360
You're my role model.

261
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,920
Thank you so much. Good luck with working out.

262
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,970
If you don't mind, can I ask for a hug?

263
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,700
Yes. Sure.

264
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,430
I'm sorry but I'm afraid that's not allowed.

265
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,810
Senior.

266
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,180
I get jealous easily.

267
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,910
If you don't mind,

268
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,720
can I hug you instead?

269
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,610
I'm afraid that's not...

270
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:36,920
Thank you.

271
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

272
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,950
Hello.

273
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,850
I'm An-na.

274
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,580
I'm a big fan of yours.

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Thank you.

276
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,730
Do you have something to tell me?

277
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,130
Why are you walking on eggshells around me?

278
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,110
You seem to be in a bad mood.

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,450
Why are you so careless?

280
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,150
What if that man suddenly kisses you?

281
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,860
He doesn't look like someone who would do that.

282
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,730
You never know what someone's thinking.

283
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,700
You still don't know how I feel until now.

284
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Senior.

285
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,160
[In the next episode]

286
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,220
There might be times when I won't be able to help you out.

287
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,490
Okay, Senior.

288
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll be more careful next time.

289
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,090
Our MV teaser will be released soon.

290
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,660
Let's promote it and increase the views.

291
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,120
I can never do that. Never!

292
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,190
How could you plan such a dangerous thing?

293
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,510
The song...

295
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,510
Let's listen to the music for a while more.

296
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,650
Let's hurry and go now.
