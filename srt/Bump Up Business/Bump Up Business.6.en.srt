Ms. Dajung. We're leaving tomorrow morning by plane, right?

186
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,370
Yes, that's right.

187
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,120
But, Jihoon, will you be able to take the plane?

188
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,450
I asked the doctor for some medicine just in case.

189
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,240
I'll be fine.

190
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,160
Besides, Eden is by my side.

191
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,230
By the way, there are no more work activities

192
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,010
scheduled for today, right?

193
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,650
Yes, that's right.

194
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,680
So,

195
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,230
why don't the three of us have some sashimi?

196
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,230
Oh? Senior.

197
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,190
Jihoon.

198
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,290
Where are you going?

199
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,130
Come on. Charge forward.

200
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,550
Together.

201
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,620
One, two.

202
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,310
I'm not done filming.

203
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,280
One, two, three.

204
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,260
Eden.

205
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,840
Yes?

206
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,070
What are you thinking so deeply about?

207
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,110
Oh, nothing.

208
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,090
This is where I always come at Jeheung Island.

209
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,970
What do you think?

210
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,340
Do you like it?

211
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,800
Yes.

212
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,770
It's so beautiful.

213
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,910
Everything is beautiful.

214
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,310
That's a relief.

215
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,000
Bro!

216
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,640
Thank you!

217
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,290
For everything!

218
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,410
No.

219
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,910
I love you.

220
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,650
Darn it.

[Rich brat J- piano]

222
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,460
Hello, J.

223
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,390
What's up?

224
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,350
Hello.

225
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,450
I've been keeping up with your show.

226
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,680
Recently, on your show,

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,550
there was a group called Lion Heart.

228
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,310
Do you know the member named Eden?

229
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,870
Eden?

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,550
What about Eden?

231
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,150
I know him well.

232
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,960
this flight will arrive at Gimpo International Airport soon.

234
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,120
Please fasten your seatbelts and open the window shades.

235
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,900
Put your seats back upright and tray table back in place.

236
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,880
Please store your luggage under the front seat or in the overhead bins.

237
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:10,240
Also, we hope the popularity of Lion Heart's two members, 
who are currently on board, will spread worldwide.

238
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,610
When you become globally famous, we hope you'll take our airline again.

239
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,330
Thank you.

240
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,410
[In the next episode]

241
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,550
MacGuffin's original new drama.

242
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,550
Congratulations.

243
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,220
That's great news.

244
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,190
Eden?

245
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,530
Don't you remember me?

246
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,840
So our relationship was nothing more than the Business Gay Performance concept.

247
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,510
It was all just a misunderstanding.

248
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,250
I'm thinking about halting Lion Heart's activities for a while.

249
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,070
That's right.

250
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,860
My feelings haven't changed.

251
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,940
I got it,

252
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,390
so take a look at this first.

253
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,700
Actually, Senior...

254
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,840
I mean, Bro...
