We've kept Hyunbin's opening portion.

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,710
Let's move on to the talk segment now.

6
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,360
It's okay, so relax.

7
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,830
Take a deep breath.

8
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,530
Everyone, be quiet.

9
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,380
Okay.

00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,630

Today, we have important guests.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,970
Lion Heart's Gong Jihoon and Kang Eden.

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,260
Hello.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,870
Let's greet everyone.

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,630
Two, three.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,300
Hello.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
We're Lion Heart's Gong Jihoon...

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,130
And Kang Eden.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,630
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,010
It's been a long time, Jihoon.

22
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,280
You've been doing well, right?

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,140
Yes.

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,470
Hello.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,700
Well, it's been a while since we've met.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,720
Jihoon and I used to be in a project group together a long time ago.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,610
He has already debuted once.

28
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,680
It wouldn't be easy to be promoting as a group with a rookie.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,789
How was it like for you?

30
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,700
Eden is a rookie,

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,550
but he got the highest scores in every aspect of our company's debut audition.

32
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,520
He's really talented.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,130
I'm just piggybacking on Eden's talents.

34
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,110
Before starting the shoot,

35
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,420
you took great care of Eden who wasn't familiar with shoots.

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,690
Are you two really close?

37
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,810
Yes.

38
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,780
While preparing for the debut of Lion Heart,

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,880
we practiced and worked together for a long time,

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,330
so we've gotten very close with each other.

41
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,880
And Eden's...

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,300
greatest strength is that he's sincere and honest.

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,250
Your MV teaser got 5 million views in the shortest amount of time.

44
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,200
Wow, that's amazing, Eden.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,050
The pledge of the water skiing mission is

46
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,640
also the talk of the town right now.

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,780
Actually, I'm scared of water.

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,540
I think that's why there's a lot of funny footage.

49
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,380
Also,

50
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,810
Jihoon kept encouraging me by telling me

51
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,660
not to give up

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,140
and to work together to complete the mission.

53
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,840
I think that's why I could complete it.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,560
I think that's also why the fans

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,190
support and cheer for us.

56
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,120
Do Hyunbin's Mini Concert.

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,550
We're filming a Summer Special episode of Lion Heart

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,070
at this special stage of Midas J Studio.

59
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,760
On the day Jihoon and Eden were taking on the water skiing mission,

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,090
I was right here filming

61
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,060
with the pianist J.

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,700
Yes, I remember.

63
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,660
I think I saw you that day.

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,220
I was worried because I was scared of water.

65
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,170
But after listening to J's piano performance,

66
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,940
I felt calmer inside while water skiing.

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,440
And that day, there was another video that went viral.

68
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,860
It's also known as the ice cream shot.

69
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,930
But some netizens think that your interactions

70
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,230
are 100% fake

71
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,650
and that you're just doing it because of the company's policy.

72
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,530
There are also rumors that you two are not close,

73
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,040
but you're pretending to be so.

74
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,660
What do you think about that?

75
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,220
Those rumors...

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,150
I'm sure that everyone watching knows

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,860
that I'm close to Jihoon personally.

78
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,870
That's why I know what kind of person he likes.

79
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,060
But no matter how I see it,

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,910
Eden...

81
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,820
you don't seem like his type.

82
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,100
We've spent a lot of time together,

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,910
so I really can't hide anything from you, Hyunbin.

84
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,360
But...

85
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,370
as time goes by, your ideal type also changes a lot.

86
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,180
Over the time you've been in America,

87
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,200
I've changed a lot too.

88
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,800
At first,

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't expect to become this close

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,570
with Eden.

91
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,220
Jihoon, you're really good on talk shows indeed.

92
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,850
Eden.

93
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,910
I was just kidding.

94
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,270
How can you get flustered at this?

95
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,020
Yes.

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,810
I still need to teach him more.

97
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,370
Because he's...

98
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,400
my dearest younger brother.

99
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,480
We have practice and a packed schedule every day.

100
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Aren't you tired?

101
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,380
Why?

102
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
Do you have something to tell me?

103
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,400
No.

104
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,460
I just feel like... I was quite foolish.

105
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,230
You must be having a tough time.

106
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,980
Are you okay?

107
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,410
Do you want me to tell you the truth or...

108
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,390
say something professional?

109
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,130
Didn't you just call me Bro on the show?

110
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,460
Of course you should be honest.

111
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,510
To be honest, I'm having a tough time.

112
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,170
I'm physically and mentally exhausted.

113
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,610
I dare not trust anyone

114
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,650
and I don't have anyone to talk to either.

115
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
I also really miss my mom in America.

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,440
It seems like you might burst into tears at any moment.

117
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,140
Don't be like this.

118
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,840
To relieve stress,

119
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
if there's anywhere you want to go or anything you want to do,

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,280
just tell me.

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
Is that possible?

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
If possible,

123
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,610
I'd like to go visit my home in America.

124
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,640
But...

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,210
I don't think there'd be time for that.

126
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,820
I just want to go somewhere by plane

127
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,040
and get some rest for a few days.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,580
Okay. I'll try asking the higher-ups for that.

129
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,450
What?

130
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,840
Really?

131
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,360
Even if I can't go, thank you so much for saying that.

132
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,650
And thank you for earlier.

133
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,580
I panicked and didn't know how to answer.

134
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,320
It almost became a disaster.

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,940
Thank you for answering in my stead.

136
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,240
Hey, What would you do without me?

137
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
I know.

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,860
What would I have done without you?

139
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,960
Tell me if you need anything from now on.

140
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,460
Also, Eden,

141
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,320
from now on, why don't you just call me Bro without qualms?

142
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,650
Well, should I?

143
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,020
Bro.

144
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,930
Also,

145
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,610
try to stay away from Do Hyunbin from now on.

146
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,810
Okay.

147
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,080
Gong Jihoon.

148
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,150
Thank you for your hard work.

149
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,970
You too.

150
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,700
Jihoon.

151
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,290
Thank you for your hard work.

152
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,430
Don't ever think about trying to meet me through shows or anything else again.

153
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,380
Don't contact me either.

154
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,120
This is the last time.

155
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,760
Thank you.

156
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,300
You're all here.

157
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,710
Gong Jihoon, Kang Eden.

158
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,340
You've been so busy since you became a group.

159
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,640
So

160
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,210
go to Jeheung Island for a few days

161
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,860
to eat and rest well.

162
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,960
All of a sudden?

163
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,090
Are you serious?

164
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,890
Of course.

165
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,490
Here are your tickets.

166
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,940
I specially got business class tickets.

167
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,070
Is it really business class?

168
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,400
No way.

169
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,930
Are we really just going there for a break?

170
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,490
Of course. Just go rest.

171
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,170
Are you afraid I'll make you work?

172
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,350
Just go there and get a good rest. And if you get a minute,

173
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,970
attend the ambassador appointment ceremony at the city hall.

174
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,929
Yes, that's it. That's all the work you have to do.

175
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,549
I knew it.

176
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,590
I knew it was too good to be true.

177
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,299
Listen.

178
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,970
I wanted you to just rest well there.

179
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,820
But Dajung insisted that since you're going there any way,

180
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,590
you should do some work there.

181
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,300
CEO Nicki.

182
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,580
When did I say that?

183
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,130
Anyway, Dajung, go and adjust their schedules first.

184
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,570
Okay?

185
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,630
Oh, right. I have an appointment.

186
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,480
Listen.

187
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,590
It wasn't me.

188
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,790
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

189
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,150
I know.

190
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,110
I know how CEO Nikki is.

191
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,020
I've never been to Jeheung Island before.

192
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,260
I'm looking forward to it so much that I'm getting happy.

193
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,210
How about you?

194
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,890
Have you been to Jeheung Island many times?

195
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,990
Yes, I've been to Jeheung Island many times.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,490
By boat.

197
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,280
You take business class often too, right?

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,810
Actually, I've never been in business class before.

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,090
Jihoon is wasting his time.

200
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,880
You can tell he's straight.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,190
He's quite handsome.

202
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,870
He's exactly my type.

203
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,130
What's handsome about him?

204
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,280
You have such bad taste.

205
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,850
How about I try to hook up with him?

206
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,530
I'd love it if you will.

207
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,400
Ms. Dajung.

208
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Why are you dressed like this?

209
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,680
Are we going to Hawaii?

210
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm too embarrassed to go with you.

211
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,770
That's why we can't go together.

212
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,460
I'll go first.

213
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,540
You two can rest first.

214
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,820
Mr. Nowon will send you to the airport in 40 minutes.

215
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,190
Why? Are we not going on the same flight?

216
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,690
Didn't Eden say I'm embarrassing?

217
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm just kidding.

218
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,010
I have to go and rent a car among other things.

219
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,840
Jihoon and Eden, go to the airport together.

220
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,190
I'm going to be late. I'll get going.

221
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,510
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now experiencing turbulence.

222
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,020
Please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt.

223
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,570
-Ladies and gentlemen, we are now experiencing turbulence.
-Senior, are you not feeling well?

224
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,840
Please return to your seat...

225
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,620
-and fasten your seatbelt.
-Maybe I should have just taken the ferry.

226
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,560
A boat?

227
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,850
Nothing.

228
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,730
It's probably because I didn't get a good sleep.

229
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,850
You don't have to bother about me.

230
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,350
Okay.

231
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,990
This is nice.

232
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,620
Senior.

233
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,400
Senior, are you okay?

234
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,270
Help!

235
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,460
Help!

236
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,280
What happened?

237
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,140
He...

238
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,170
It's okay.

239
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,290
I'm fine, Eden.

240
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,740
Is there a doctor among the passengers?

241
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,410
The plane is landing soon.

242
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,220
I’ll report it to the captain.

243
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,080
In order to stabilize this patient,

244
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,400
it'd be good for you to help him out.

245
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,010
My manager isn't here either.

246
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,760
I don't know what to do by myself.

247
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,370
I'll check if there are doctors among the other passengers.

248
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,660
Thank you.

249
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,730
Senior.

250
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,730
Senior, hang in there.

251
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,280
We're arriving at Jeheung Island soon.

252
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,640
Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to land.

253
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,840
Please check if your seatbelt is properly fastened.

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,250
Jihoon, I'm sorry.

255
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,350
I've heard about it from CEO Nicki.

256
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,570
You should've suggested for us to go by boat.

257
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,430
It's okay.

258
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,310
I should be the one apologizing.

259
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,880
I never had a relapse after I resumed my activities.

260
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,210
I was the one who told CEO Nicki that I'd go by plane.

261
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,390
But are you really okay?

262
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,540
I was really worried about you.

263
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,360
You were so happy when you heard that you'd be going to Jeheung Island by plane in business class.

264
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,090
How could I have suggested a boat ride?

265
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,430
Thank you for what you did in the plane.

266
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,690
Go back and rest first.

267
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,700
Yes, Eden.

268
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,080
If you both keep staying here,

269
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,650
people would think something big happened

270
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,870
and reporters will start coming here too.

271
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,370
It'll be more troublesome if the news gets out.

272
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,170
So, Eden, you'd better go back to the hotel first.

273
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,360
I'll call a taxi for you.

274
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,080

Is Jihoon okay?

278
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,490
He's feeling much better.

279
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,320
But why are you here?

280
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,210
I happen to be at Jeheung Island

281
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,500
and CEO Nicki informed me about it.

282
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,640
But where's Jihoon?

283
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,020
Wait.

284
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,840
He just fell asleep.

285
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,780
It's better to let him rest for a while.

286
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,700
I'm also going back to my hotel.

287
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,480
Why don't you see him another time?

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,330
Really?

289
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,330
Then let's not stay here.

290
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,320
I'll take Eden back to his place.

Come with me.

292
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,400
By the time I come back here after I take you to the hotel,

293
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,070
Jihoon should have woken up.

294
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,150
Also,

295
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,930
stay away from Do Hyunbin from now on.

296

It's fine.

297
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,070
I'll just take a taxi.

298
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,240
Come on. Jihoon will get mad at me if you do so.

299
