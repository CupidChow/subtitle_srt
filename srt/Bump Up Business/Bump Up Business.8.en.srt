[Final Episode]

4
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,530
What are you doing?

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,820
Didn't you say you just want to get along as friends?

6
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,370
Yes, I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,120
I suddenly thought of the past and impulsively tried to kiss you.

8
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,280
Anyway, we had fun back then, right?

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,420
Enough.

10
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,900
I'm tired. You should go too.

11
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,370
We just need to get along like a group.

12
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,050
It's okay.

13
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,880
I'll take the lead from now on.

14
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,050
You got here with your skills.

15
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,220
Don't mind what others say.

16
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,789
The one I'm inseparable with right now...

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,050
is Kang Eden.

18
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,690
What would you do without me?

19
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,590
What would I do without you indeed?

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Woosung. Dong-gun.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,390
Hi, Ms. Dajung.

22
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,730
Are you able to contact Eden?

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,430
He read all my messages, but he didn't reply.

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,020
This has never happened before.

25
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,210
He hasn't been here for the past few days.

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,970
Did he run away with Senior Jihoon?

27
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,590
Throughout the industry, rumor has it

28
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,960
that their intimacy isn't just an act.

29
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,130
-Don't tell me they went on their honeymoon?
-Your imagination is running wild again.

30
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,800
All right. Enough.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,490
It's my fault for coming here.

32
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,500
But anyway, Woosung, you're closest to Eden.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,820
So convey this to him.

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,050
Fortunately, all his activities for the week has been rescheduled,

35
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,460
and I don't know what's going on,

36
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,710
but tell him to get a good rest and return to his original state as soon as possible.

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,680
Also, Jihoon seems very sick.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,440
He's your senior at the company after all.

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,760
Send him a message to check on him.

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,820
Okay.

41
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,280
I'll get going.

42
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,170
What's with the flowers?

43
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,650
Thank you.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,110
Sorry.

You're here.

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,710
I'm sorry for calling you out when you're sick.

48
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm going back home to America tomorrow

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,480
and I'll be working there for the time being,

50
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,100
so I'm afraid I won't be able to see you for a while.

51
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,660
Don't say that. I'm the one who should be apologizing.

52
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,040
Are you hurting a lot?

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,630
With what?

54
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,080
Well, just a little.

55
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,270
Let's just talk about something else.

56
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,400
What will working in America be like?

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,970
Eden. You look like you're having a really tough time.

58
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,850
Just tell me and I'll listen to it.

59
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,440
Aren't I the only one you can talk about it to?

60
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,820
I afraid to talk about it.

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,930
Just say whatever you want and don't feel burdened.

62
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,470
Only then can you breathe.

63
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,590
I'll just... be by your side.

64
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,040
You know him too.

65
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,190
It's Lion Heart's Gong Jihoon.

66
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,450
I know him, of course. He seems like a good guy.

67
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,760
I somehow fell for him hard.

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,580
During Lion Heart's activities,

69
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,500
he took great care of me.

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,300
Not long ago, we went to Jeheung Island together and...

71
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,420
I'm not entirely sure...

72
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,980
But I think I really fell in love with him.

73
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,290
Not as a colleague or a friend, but...

74
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,740
Eden, it's okay.

75
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,750
But I did something wrong to him.

76
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,970
I think he was badly hurt by me.

77
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,020
What did you do wrong?

78
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,890
Well, I think I did many things wrong.

79
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,990
I'm not sure either.

80
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,100
And it seems like Jihoon needs someone else more than me.

81
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,420
He told me not to get too close to him.

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,540
Then is your relationship over?

83
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:37,110
No, I don't know right now.

84
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,080
Did you tell him what you just told me?

85
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,380
No.

86
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,409
Not yet.

87
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,570
No matter what the situation is,

88
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,590
and even if you're afraid of what might become of your relationship,

89
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,140
confess to him like how I confessed to you,

90
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,650
honestly and sincerely.

91
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,780
I know, but...

92
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,100
You know that deep down, Jihoon feels the same way as you too.

93
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,720
You should have the courage to confess.

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,110
Yes, you're right.

95
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,850
My thoughts are less haphazard now.

96
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,890
J, thank you.

97
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
It is my secret.

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,170
It is very simple.

99
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:28,140
It is only with the heart that we can see clearly.

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,430

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Do you remember that?

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,150
That's from the story Little Prince that we read when we were young.

104
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,080
Of course I remember that.

105
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,970
J, thank you so much.

106
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,980
I don't want to hear something like "thank you".

107
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,920
It would be better if it was something like "I love you".

108
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,790
I'm just kidding.

109
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,870
Thank goodness it was you.

110
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,320
What?

111
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,030
I'm glad you were my first love.

112
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,280
J, come back soon after you go to America.

113
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll miss you a lot.

114
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,290
Okay, thank you.

115
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,570
Good luck with your drama.

116
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,580
I hope you and Jihoon will get along well too.

117
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,740
Okay.

118
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,620
See you again, my first love, J!

119
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,020
Please leave now.

120
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,260
How many times do I have to tell you that I want to be alone?

121
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,330
Okay. It's because you're having such a tough time.

122
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,900
So just eat a little.

123
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,550
Don't you have any pride?

124
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,610
No matter what you do, we can't go back to the way we used to be.

125
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,770
So, just leave now.

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,130
Who is it?

127
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,180
No one. It could be the mailman.

128
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll go and take a look.

129
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,230
Senior, what are you doing here?

130
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,060
What do you think?

131
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,540
Can't you tell? We're back together.

132
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,110
You're lying.

133
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,130
I still love Jihoon.

134
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,280
Jihoon is working hard on our relationship too.

135
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,190
And he doesn't want to see you at all right now.

136
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,440
Otherwise, he would have already come out to see you.

137
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,990
Who loves whom?

138
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,760
Is that why you threatened me despicably

139
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,040
and did all that to Jihoon?

140
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,920
Stop with your creepy obsession.

141
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,640
Obsession? Then what are you doing?

142
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
Jihoon said he doesn't want anything to do with you anymore.

143
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,430
Get out of my way. I'll ask him myself.

144
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,940
Come to your senses, Eden.

145
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,250
Jihoon was just momentarily confused.

146
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,060
Do you think there's anyone else other than me who can accept him as he is?

147
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,800
Everyone knows.

148
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,150
Your relationship with him will also be revealed sooner or later.

149
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,060
Just a Business Gay Performance concept?

150
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,590
Do you think that's enough to fool the public?

151
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,800
Your friends will hear about it,

152
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,170
including your parents.

153
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,530
Can you handle the consequences?

154
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,890
I don't care. Get out of my way.

155
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,880
Stop it! Why can't you understand the situation?

156
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,270
Get out of my way!

157
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,820
Go.

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm sorry.

160

I've given him his in-ear monitors.

167
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,590
Please tell him

168
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,490
that I said congratulations.

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,960
You're even using separate waiting rooms.

173
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,820
Tell him yourself.

Bro, was that really how it was for you?

181
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,980
Was all the time you spent with me

182
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,270
just business?

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,030
It wasn't just business for me.

184
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,510
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

185
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,450
Until now, my feelings for you have never changed.

186
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,990
Eden.

187
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,480
There's one last thing I have to say.

188
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,330
Bro, I loved you.

189
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,950
No, I still love you.

190
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,680
I said I love you.

191
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,370
I love you.

192
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,890
What did you say?

193
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,500
I said I love you.

194
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
It's your turn.

195
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,890
When I close my eyes, I think of you.

196
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,260
I don't want to wake up from my dream.

197
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,280
When I open the window, it seems like your voice is drifting towards me with the wind

198
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,140
[Thank you for watching Bump Up Business.]

199
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,050
and waking me up.

200
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,920
Words are not enough to describe how beautiful you are.

201
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,310
How oh how did I become so obsessed with you?

202
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,700
Your smile is like a green puzzle.

203
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,000
My life has changed after I met you.

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,310
Fine, I'll look for you. Wandering aimlessly like a child.

205
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,850
I want to stay in the season that resembles you so that you can see me.

206
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,920
You're my evergreen. Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

207
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,910
You're like an evergreen tree.

208
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,790
You're my evergreen. Eh evergreen. Eh evergreen.

209
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,280
I'll be the shade that keeps you cool.

210
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,260
Oh nanana. Oh nana.

211
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,770
This moment is shining.

212
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,190
You're my only one, my evergreen.
