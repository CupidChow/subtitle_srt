Good job.

Whoa, she didn't know, either. Daebak!

Wait, let me process this.

Whoa! There will be two 5th-generation idols born from our class!

Why are both of them not here?

41

So, that's how Lee Dong Min knew.

But honestly, what is Kang Wu Bin thinking?

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,430

Can you stop calling my name?

It's full of interesting things.

51

This is what you used to threaten Kang Wu Bin, right?

52
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,360
No wonder the confession felt so lame.

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,370
I thought it was so random.

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,290
You won't tell the other kids, right?

55
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,390
Kang Wu Bin had no ill intention. Rather-

56
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,980
Hey!

57
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,910
I told you to stop being pretentious.

Do you know who that is?

61
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,720
Look forward to it. He deceived the entire school.

62
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,560
I have the video here.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,820
If I expose this, Kang Wu Bin's school life will be over.

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,550
So, that means he deceived the entire school.

77
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,180

I didn't know you were a trainee.

85
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,620
Of course, you didn't. I never told you.

86
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,470
You know, I think Kang Wu Bin will get seriously hurt.

87
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,190
The situation is really bad right now.

88

No, that's...

93

Yeah, that pisses me off! But what pisses me off more...

178

is that Kim Ji Eun knew that you and I

186
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,460
I actually feel relieved.

187
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,730
I really could've stopped it somehow!

188
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,450
Why did you do this? The comments are...

189
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,880
♫ I burst into tears with you standing in front of me ♫

190
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,310
It's all right.

191
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,580
Really.

192
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:05,470
♫ That I've missed you, that I've longed for you ♫

193
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,990
♫ I couldn't even tell you anything, but hello ♫

194
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,760
[Fraud]

195
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,430
I know how to erase this. Hold on.

196
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,870
It's okay.

197
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,450
Crazy conning bastard.

198
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,460
I want to vomit. That's f***ing fraud.

199
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,700
What's wrong with you?

200
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,860
H-Hey, throwing trash is too harsh!

201
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,920
- Guys, stop it!
- I'm just throwing it in the trash.

202
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,340
That's enough, guys! Stop it!

203
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,890
Look at you running your mouth.

204
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,610
Hey, your mouth is the real trash!

205
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, Kang Wu Bin.

206
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,210
Let's go to the snack bar.

207
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,360
Snack bar?

208
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,740
I really need to follow a diet regimen now.

209
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,240
You should treat me to my last supper.

210
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,050
Are you mugging me?

211
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,380
Forget it if you don't want to.

212
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,070
Better for me if I go with Kim Ji Eun.

213
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,480
I'm going, I'm going.

214
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,200
I'll treat you.

215
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:00,700
With that, I hope you spend a meaningful vacation,

216
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,610
and return to school in good health.

217
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,960
Now, we will start the awards ceremony

218
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,020
for the second Gaeon High School Reels Competition.

219
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,190
The winner is...

220
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,280
Kang Wu Bin.

221
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,990
Please come forward.

222
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,060
If it was going to end up like this...

223
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,130
Shit. It's wrong to have him win just because he had the most views.

224
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,760
This award is being presented because he received

225
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,500
the highest number of views and likes in the

226
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,540
second Gaeon High School Reels Competition

227
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,280
held on the community app, Insider Time.

228
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,550
Finally, a word from the winner.

229
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,070
I know a speech is supposed to be formal.

230
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,210
But rather than a speech,

231
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,820
I'd like to say this to my friends, so I'll speak casually.

232
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,640
First off, I'm sorry, everyone.

233
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,610
Hey, just turn off the TV!

234
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,570
- Why bother listening to that bastard?
- Turn it off.

235
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,220
- Yes, just turn it off.
- Just turn it off.

236
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,640
No!

237
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,730
Let's just watch, please. Okay?

238
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,380
As you all know,

239
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
I'm a fraud.

240
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,280
You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy. Right?

241
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,150
Getting attention didn't feel too bad.

242
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,430
But how are you a trainee-

243
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,900
I...

244
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,710
like Kim Ji Eun.

245
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,130
I was having fun for a moment, but so much time passed.

246
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,830
If it wasn't for somebody, even more time would've passed.

247
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,250
The Confession Day isn't over yet.

248
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,610
I like you, Kim Ji Eun.

249
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:23,970
I tried not to get caught at first, no matter what.

250
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,460
What about you?

251
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,720
I thought that was the way to protect myself.

252
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,540
But in reality,

253
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,830
I completely failed to protect my friends who were on my side.

254
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,320
I couldn't do anything for them.

255
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,980
I didn't have the courage to be honest.

256
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,250
And I ended up getting the courage

257
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,140
from the person I least expected.

258
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,370
I'm...

259
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,440
IT's administrator.

260
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,330
I want to be totally honest now.

261
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,520
Popularity and attention...

262
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,420
Someone who can treat

263
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,020
everyone sincerely, even without those things.

264
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,430
Because I want to become someone like that,

265
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,370
though it's much too late,

266
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,660
let me tell you before it's even later.

267
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,350
I'm really...

268
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,530
I'm really sorry for everything.

269
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,710
That's all.

270
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,060
Hey, Mo Bong.

271
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,980
Did you cry?

272
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,450
What about you?

273
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,300
Aren't you even mad at Kang Wu Bin?

274
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,300
Aren't you pissed off that your friend did that?

275
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,550
Because we're friends.

276
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,230
Because we're friends, just as you said.

277
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,540
So, I can ask him why he did that

278
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,300
and hear him out.

279
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,960
Also, everyone has a lie or two buried in their hearts.

280
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,070
I'm sure you're the same!

281
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,020
Just let me catch you just once.

282
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,820
Forget it.

283
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,370
Hurry up and come so we can go get some malatang.

284
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,580
Why the long face?

285
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,350
You should just curse me out.

286
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,600
Why would I curse you out?

287
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,250
I can't complain even if you were to cut ties with me.

288
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,930
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,520
Son of a bitch.

290
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,980
You're really a f***ing asshole!

291
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,060
Do you know that, you maniac?

292
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,520
You're good at cursing.

293
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,920
Aren't you sick of me?

294
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,450
I sniped you on Insider Time.

295
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,640
I don't have the right to.

296
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,290
I mistreated a friend who trusted me for eight years.

297
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,420
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,160
I shouldn't have done that, either.

299
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,470
You didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,760
I mean it.

301
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,270
♫ I'm waiting alone for you, missing you ♫

302
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:39,630
♫ Tonight, I'm under the starlight that used to embrace the darkness ♫

303
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,680
This was exactly the spot.

304
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,910
Take care.

305
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,290
[Wu Bin ♥]

306
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,400
Kang Wu Bin, where are you?

307
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,240
Yes.

308
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,290
Why are you running?

309
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,510
You did a great job, really.

310
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,140
Huh?

311
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,320
T-Thank you.

312
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,760
One moment, though.

313
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,110
Sorry. I didn't mean to.

314
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,110
I just thought you went through a lot.

315
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm sorry if I offended you.

316
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,190
No, I liked it.

317
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,980
That's not what I mean... You know...

318
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,970
What I'm trying to say is-

319
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,700
Shall we sit?

320
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,900
♫ Love is sweet ♫

321
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,370
I didn't expect you to take it head-on like that.

322
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,480
You were great.

323
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,110
Not at all.

324
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,140
I'm also going to do it with my own strength.

325
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,750
Of course, it'll be difficult.

326
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,780
But I learned a lot from you.

327
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,280
You didn't learn anything.

328
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,890
You say I gave you insider lessons,

329
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,850
but I don't think I taught you.

330
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,660
Because I learned more from you.

331
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,570
From me?

332
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,440
No way.

333
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,820
We should...

334
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,460
continue doing this.

335
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,880
No, we don't need to do it anymore.

336
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,260
You don't need to cater to me.

337
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,510
But I want to continue.

338
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,730
Kang Wu Bin...

339
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,530
you know...

340
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,360
- I actually-
- I like you.

341
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,660
I mean it.

342
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,710
Right now,

343
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,670
I like you a lot, Ji Eun.

344
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,330
♫ Love or dream, they're things I muttered ♫

345
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,220
♫ Once tomorrow comes again, I'll try to breathe again ♫

346
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,970
♫ Just like dreamy flowers that bloom out of my reach ♫

347
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,940
♫ Tomorrow will come for sure because time isn't lazy ♫

348
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,430
What did you have for breakfast?

349
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,340
Breakfast? I had cereal.

350
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,660
Cereal? I told you to eat healthy.

351
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,980
Did you have breakfast?

352
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,830
No, I slept in as usual.

353
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,930
Hey, what are you two doing?

354
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,100
Come on. Give it a rest.

355
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,790
You happy?

356
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,040
Gosh, it's hot.

357
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,640
Back to school is annoying enough, and I have to see this, too?

358
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,140
Ji Eun, hit me up if you get in a fight with Kang Wu Bin.

359
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,420
I'll tell you all about his cringe-worthy past.

360
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,820
Really? What's in store?

361
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,730
Hey, that's not right!

362
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,600
- Do I have cringeworthy past?
- It's too hot.

363
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,870
How have you been?

364
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,910
Whoa, you managed to come when you said you're busy, Idol.

365
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,800
You're right.

366
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,830
So, I can't play with you anymore. You know, right?

367
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,940
Whatever.

368
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,720
Hey, you look great.

369
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,530
You'll make it to be a sixth, seventh, and even 10th generation idol.

370
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,090
I guarantee you.

371
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,300
Hey, you're not dissing me, right?

372
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,880
- Diss?
- Wu Bin.

373
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,570
That's not how that works.

374
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,900
- You think it's like a level?
- Insider.

375
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,110
Someone with lots of friends and

376
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,840
gets attention from everywhere, playing an important role.

377
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,570
That's the definition of insider I knew.

378
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,630
Hey, forget it. Let's hurry up and go.

379
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,900
We'll be tardy on our first day. Hurry up.

380
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,080
But it means something different to me now.

381
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,680
Someone I can share my time and feelings with.

382
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:04,690
When you can accept each other just as you are.

383
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,990
That's more than enough.

384
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,500
- It's like that. Isn't it?
- Right, right.
