Can't you act natural?

185
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,390
Is it that hard?

186
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,240
Hey...

187
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,770
are you crying?

188
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,830
It's hard.

189
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,370
It's hard, I said.

190
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,760
What?

191
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,380
You were born with everything, so you don't have to do this.

192
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,570
I can never be funny, and I'm not a good listener.

193
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,130
Geez, why is it so hard?

194
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,990
You'd never understand.

195
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,360
You were born to be popular.

196
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,300
Born to be popular?

197
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,790
That's just what you think.

198
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,540
Huh?

199
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,330
As you know,

200
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,870
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that lie.

201
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,600
I think you would've been popular without that.

202
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,340
I don't know.

203
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,670
Once they find out the truth,

204
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,950
becoming an outsider won't be the end of it.

205
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,530
I think Kang Wu Bin would've been popular, no matter what.

206
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,400
Mo Bong Gu is really popular, too.

207
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,740
Who likes him that much, anyway?

208
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,680
Should I help them out?

209
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,220
Maybe being Cupid can be my character.

210
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,910

Don't call me that, either.

247
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,430
I call you a dud because you're one. What else?

248
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,400
I'm not anymore.

Don't tell the other kids, either.

250
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,370
Is it because Kang Wu Bin confessed his love?

That's her nickname.

More importantly, do you know each other? Childhood friends?

271
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,280
Something like that.

272
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,380
I stopped her whenever she tried to hang out with bad kids.

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,240
He might respond.

285
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,450
He's fun.

286
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,060
It's cute how sociable he is, too.

00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,520
What?

288
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,110
Why are you looking at me like that?

289
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,820
By chance, are you in love?

290
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,510
By chance, are you into me over these two?

Well, no.

293
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,360
Will you accept him?

294
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,190
Hey, why do you ask so directly?

295
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,480
It's not as easy as it sounds.

296
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,240
Of course not. I heard Kang Wu Bin is an idol trainee.
