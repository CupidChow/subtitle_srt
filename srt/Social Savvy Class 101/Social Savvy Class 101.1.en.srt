All done! Thanks.

179

Let's hurry up. You'll be late for PE.

180

You're not going?

181
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,060
I don't feel too well. I'm going to the nurse's office.

182
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,640
Hey, pass! Pass!

183
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,030
Wrong way! I said over here!

184
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,040
Pass, pass! Kwang Hyeon, over here!

185
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,230
Come on! Here, here!

186

Take this!

187
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,530
- That's f***ing hilarious!
- She didn't know!

188
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,920
She became broke trying to attend a fan signing event!

189
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,590
Whatever! My dad's going to kill me if he finds out.

190
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,470
Our Wu Bin will be like that one day, huh?

191
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,630
We'll have to buy a shitload of his albums to meet him.

192
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,140
- Why?
- Hey, did you see IT?

193
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,940
- What is it?
- Someone posted secretly taken photos of our Wu Bin!

194
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,510
Hey, can't we report this?

195
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,030
This is our first time talking, right?

196
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,000
It's anonymous, so we can't even catch the guy.

197
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,060
Gosh, can't we just reveal their real names?

198
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,740
Are you nuts? Then, none of us will be able to attend school.

Hey, Kim Chae*. Look at your lips.

200

When did you buy that?

201
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll show you in class later. This is freaking expensive!

202
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,330

Don't cross the line! What would I do with a girl's lipstick?

207

Whoever you are! Weren't you the last to come out earlier?

210
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,660
You came out while we were warming up during PE.

211
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,740
Look at her. Why can't she speak?

212
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,420
You know about the theft in our classroom lately, right?

213
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,070
Don't be upset since we're only asking due to its sensitive nature.

214
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,420
Were you the last to come out?

215
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,840
The one who left after me was Wu Bin...

216
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,100
Hey!

217
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,760
Whoa, I can't hear a f***ing word she's saying.

218
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,340
Hey, what did you say?

219
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,260
- What's with her?
- She's suspicious.

220
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,590
She's freaking creepy.

221
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,040
Who has spoken to her before?

222
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,590
Stop accusing her. I was the last to leave.

223
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,080
You were?

224
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,000
Come to think of it, I didn't see you during PE.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,350
I was in the nurse's office, and I locked the classroom.

226
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,260
I also unlocked it in time for your return.

227
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,660
I didn't see anyone suspicious.

228
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,230
More importantly, it wasn't her.

229
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,930
She left later because I asked her for a favor.

230
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,770
That's what he says, but what if Kang Wu Bin stole it?

231
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,450
As if! Is Wu Bin crazy?

232
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,190
Just shut your mouth!

233
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,050
Yes, I sincerely apologize.

236

What the heck? You didn't even look properly.

237
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,230
Hey, you're f***ing unbelievable.

238
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,260
You better apologize.

(Sorry in Japanese.)

You're not upset, are you?

241
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,520
I'm not.

242
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,780
You could've just said Wu Bin was the last to leave.

243
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,780
It wasn't that hard.

244

And you? Are you sick?

246

247
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,400
