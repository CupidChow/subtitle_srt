- His face is freaking tiny.

Lee Dong Min, were we 10 years old when we met?

56
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,380
Like you said,

57
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,750
you know me well since you've seen me for a long time.

58
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,100
I was a dud, like you said, and I couldn't get along with the other kids-

59
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
What about that?

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,790
I didn't want to be like that anymore,

61
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,140
so I really tried my best.

62
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,710
Insider... Sure.

63
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,940
I wanted to become an insider getting attention,

64
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,130
so I did a lot of things I usually wouldn't do.

65

But without even realizing it,

66

I don't think we need to reveal everything.

142

You can just say you got dropped from the debut team.

You're really not going to tell me what's wrong?

You think you're special?

185
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,600
No, since you asked me that time...

186
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,240
So, why are you telling me this now?

187
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,580
What does your relationship with him have to do with me?

188
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,870
Do I look like a joke to you because I collapsed after taking those pills?

189
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,010
And why do you keep acting like we're friends?

190
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,980
Don't cross the line.

191
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,880
Sorry. I just...

192
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,150
Who are you to accept or reject Kang Wu Bin?

193
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,050
How obnoxious.

194
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,190
How did she know?

195
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:31,450
She likes Kang Wu Bin?

196
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,900
- Gosh, he's so handsome!
- Did you watch the teaser?

197
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,360
- Of course, I did.
- Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,330
Kang Wu Bin will be in the teaser, too, right?

199
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,740
I had no idea!

200
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,740
Isn't he so handsome?

201

Hold your horses! Why are you acting like amateurs?

202
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,940
Our Wu Bin will be overwhelmed if you overreact.

203
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,340
It just feels real now that the photos are out.

204
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,670
Hey, you know what to do when Kang Wu Bin comes, right?

205
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,160
No, "Whoa!"

206
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,850
No, "Daebak!"

207
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,800
No, "Wu Bin, can I get your autograph?"

208
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,690
- Oh, come on!
- Why can't we?

209
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,670
We should get Wu Bin's autograph in advance!

210

212
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,280
Kang Wu Bin? No.

213

I haven't seen him for a while.

214
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,030
He's not reading my texts, either.

215

Hey, what will happen to you two now?

216
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,140
Are you dating or not?

Is it a fling or not?

218
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:06,340
It can't be. He's debuting soon, so I guess he can't?

219
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,930
Bong Gu, I have to tell you something.

220
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,810
Then, could you spread that rumor?

221
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,620
To be honest, that confession-

222
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,020
Huh?

223
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,770
Hey, what is this?

224
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,390
Did you see this?

225
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,730
My uncle's acquaintance is on V Entertainment's A&amp;R team.

226
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,610
He said the boy group has five members.

227
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,540
But the thing is all the members have been trainees for at least three years.

228
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,910
Kang Wu Bin was a trainee for only one year. What's going on?

229
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,750
Uncle's acquaintance, my foot.

No, I'm serious.

234
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,100
This has never happened before. Why does it keep getting deleted?

236

I didn't even get to read it.

237
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,950
It's allegedly about Kang Wu Bin, but no one got to read it.

238
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,440
Apparently, it keeps getting deleted.

239
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,880
Is it just mindless hating?

240
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
Is there an IT administrator?

I know I haven't done anything right.

256
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,310
But I didn't know how to befriend anyone.

257

I'm pissed off.

He doesn't know. He has no idea!
