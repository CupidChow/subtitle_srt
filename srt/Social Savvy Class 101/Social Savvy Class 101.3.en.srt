A couple was born in Class 3 this morning.

192
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,070
I got a message. He said he'd come to confess during lunch.

193
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,700

207
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,490
It'd be pointless if he confessed without anyone knowing.

- Get me, get me.
- Are you finished?

252
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,210
Did he run away just like that?

253
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,330
That's why you can't aim in video games.
