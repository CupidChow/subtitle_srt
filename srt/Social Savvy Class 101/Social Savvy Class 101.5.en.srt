1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,300
I never intended to lie.

2
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,430
Is he really debuting?

3
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,150
That's what I heard. It's still hard to believe.

4
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,300
A trainee at our school?

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,290
I just never denied it.

6
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,280
That's how I became the center of attention.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,570
I saw God-tier Wu Bin today.

8
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,430
He's better looking in person.

9
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,230
Wu Bin's so nice.

10
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,460
Hurry and debut! I'm rooting for you.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,060
The top three rude remarks our school students are surprisingly unaware of.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,670
"Doing well?" Do you think I am when Kang Wu Bin isn't next to me?

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,800
"Did you eat?" Do you think I can eat when Kang Wu Bin isn't next to me?

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,740
"Take care." Do you think I can take care when Kang Wu Bin isn't next to me?

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,770
By the time I was more accustomed to the pros than the cons of this life,

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,750
too much time had already passed.

[Social Savvy Class 101]

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,520
How long will you keep this up? You fake trainee.

23
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,470
What did you just say?

24
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,660
It's a lie. You being a trainee.

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,580
That's out of the blue...

26
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,450
How did you know?

27
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,450
Is that important?

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,210
How long did you think you could hide it?

29
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,380
I'll take care of it.

30
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,030
Is lying for an entire year your idea of taking care of it?

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,490
F***! Let go of me!

She's a real dud who doesn't know how to filter garbage like you!

Are you talking about Kim Ji Eun?

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,610
Did Kim Ji Eun tell you?

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,910
- What bullshit-
- This is my business!

37
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,550
I know what I'm doing.

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,740
But it's up to you if you want to expose me.

It's so good! This place is amazing.

You've never been here before?

43
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,820
This place is a must-visit if you're from our school.

44
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,090
This is really your first time here?

45
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,820
Yeah, I don't usually eat out.

46
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,670
Since people come with their friends after all...

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,290
You didn't want to eat alone, huh?

48
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,700
Huh? Yeah, you're right.

49
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,240

Hey, take your time!

52

Don't finish it.

53

Don't tell me...

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,410
- Huh?
- What?

55
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,230

What?

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,460
I'm asking you since Mo Bong isn't here.

60
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,000
How will you respond to Kang Wu Bin's confession?

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,520
Be honest between us. Okay?

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,020
Oh, that?

63
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,610
Like I said earlier, I'm still thinking about it.

64
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,820
What's there to think about? Someone like you.

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm sure you're not quibbling over details about Wu Bin.

66
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,910
I'm just really curious.

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,780
I'm very close to Wu Bin, but I had no idea.

68
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,210
Well, you see...

69
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,870
What the heck? Where are you going?

70
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,250
Something urgent came up, so I'm leaving first.

71
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,040
What was the call about?

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,470
I'm going! Enjoy the rest.

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,110
Bye!

74
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,120
- Hey!
- Huh? Yeah?

75
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,770
We were in the middle of a conversation. You didn't answer-

76
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,400
I...

77
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,610
I need the restroom.

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,170
This is all you have?

79
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,480
I went through trouble to get that.

80
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,430
You really are a loser, huh?

81
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,710
You can't even land some cigarettes?

82
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,420
You shouldn't go around lying about your "golden" middle school days, then.

83
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,770
I heard you were my boyfriend's obedient dog, always at his beck and call.

84
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,780
Woof, woof! Dog.

85
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,930
That was quite the identity change.

86
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,740
Just let it slide.

87
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,230
Not without a price.

88
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,860
From now on, you better run over when I call you.

89
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,380
Answer me.

90
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,190
All right.

91
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,700
That's not right!

92
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,140
I-Isn't that too cruel?

93
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,010
It's not like he did anything wrong in middle school.

94
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,850
Who the hell is she?

95
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,080
A friend?

96
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,100
How admirable of two losers.

97
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,050
You better behave.

98
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,090
My boyfriend is just waiting for you to slip.

99
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,190
Are you okay?

100
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

101
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,450
So, you don't have to go along-

102
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,230
Who said you could follow me?

103
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,640
Huh?

104
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,090
Why the f*** are you meddling?

105
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,920
Everyone has a secret they want to hide.

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,210
And just because I know their secret

107
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,240
doesn't mean I can easily approach that person.

108
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,000
Where are you? Is something wrong?

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,100
I have something to ask you. This never happened to me before.

110
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,040
Didn't we agree to meet before class?

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,550
I'm in the club room.

112
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,890
Did something happen to him?

What's going on?

118
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,490

119
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,010

120
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,260
It was helpful. Thank you!

121
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,420
Aigoo. Keep it charged!

122
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,050
All right.

123
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,490
Oh, what's for PE today?

124
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,090
I'll ask the PE teacher.

125
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,780
Okay!

126
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,140
Is something wrong?

127
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,450
By chance, are you mad at me...

128
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,600
Could we talk?

129
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,830
Hey, Mo Bong. Want to hit the gaming cafe today?

130
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,870
Oh, sure!

131
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,770
What the? Is something wrong?

132
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,250
Ji Eun!

133
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,840
Will you keep standing there?

134
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,830
You're in the way.

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,910
Man, I don't want to! I always lose with you.

136
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,570
Hey, what do you mean?

137
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,670
Don't you remember me hard carrying last time?

138
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,340
Not at all.

139
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,610
Geez, after all I did, huh?

140
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,490
- Then, let's make a bet today.
- Ramen?

141
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,720
You memory manipulator.

142
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,050
Ramen?

143
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,400
- Fine!
- Okay! Can't believe...

144
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,250
What? What do you have to tell me?

145
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,630
Are you really a dud?

146
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,460
You dragged me here to ask that?

147
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,230
I really want to mind my own business.

148
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,150
I need to keep a low profile.

149
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,600
But you keep doing this!

150
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,240
Do what?

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,750
Why are you hanging around Kang Wu Bin?

152
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,170
Because he's an insider? Because he's handsome?

153
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,670
I don't know about "handsome."

154
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,180
Or is it...

155
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,590
because he's an idol trainee?

156
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,250
Are you really an idiot?

157
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,790
And why are you mad?

158
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,770
You keep making me worry!

159
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,010
I mean...

160
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,870
Kang Wu Bin...

161
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,440
and Oh Bong Gu, too.

162
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
What did I do so wrong?

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,410
What on earth did I do?

164
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,000
Kang Wu Bin won't even answer me.

165
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,540
What am I supposed to do?

166
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,470
He's a nobody.

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,610
I'm going to go.

168
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,630
Stay here.

169
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,320
When will Kang Wu Bin debut?

170
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,510
It's so quiet.

171
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,660
You're right.

172
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,680
He does seem quite relaxed for a trainee.

173
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,150
Have you been a trainee?

174
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,340
Keep your mouth shut if you're clueless.

175
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,690
I told you.

176
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,690
♫ I picture you in my mind ♫

177
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't know why you're acting like this all of a sudden. What am I supposed to do?

178
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,850
Just stay here.

179
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,430
The Kang Wu Bin I know wouldn't treat me like this for no reason.

180
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,500
How much do you actually know about that bastard?

181
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,850
No, it's not just you.

182
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,290
Everyone at this school is being deceived.

183
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,890

188
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,750
You really knew.

189
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,430
So, did you go along even knowing that?

190
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,130
Did you tell the other kids?

191
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,730
Honestly...

192
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,240
- What are you thinking, huh?
- Don't tell the other kids!

193
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,840

Yes, it's not like that.

But why do you care so much about me?

202

You're just trying to mess with me, aren't you?

203
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,980
You were the same back then.

204
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,530

Why Kang Wu Bin is treating me like this?

211
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,190

212
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,170
He probably thinks you told me what I know.

367
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,910
♫ When I am down, I see you everywhere ♫

368
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,120
Stay here.

369
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:40,260
♫ In this moment, there is nothing left for me ♫

370
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,470
♫ Approaching you... ♫
