189

Hey...

190
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,720
Well, you see...

191
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,760
What's going on, Joo Yeon?

192
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,500
What?

193
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,610
Oh, sorry!

194
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,870
What was it again?

195
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,760
Was it Ji Yeon? Ji Won?

196
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,030
Ji Young? Ji Hyeon?

197
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,540
Ji Young!

198
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,570
No, she's in the other class.

199
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,180
Anyway, why did you call me here?

200
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,250
You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy, right?

201
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,820
You're the 3-minute tone-deaf guy, right?

202
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,080
What?

203
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,170
To be honest, I saw you!

204
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,260

Hey, Mo Bong! Hurry up.

207
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,380
Geez, must I do it? I don't want to.

208
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,520
Come on!

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,910
Let's practice first.

210
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,680
- Okay.
- Let's go.

211
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,890
Start!

212
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,600

- Oh, right! Sorry.

215
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,670
- Again.
- One more time.

216
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,200
Shine muscat! I'm shy!

217
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,510
Oh, Kang Wu Bin! Come on!

218
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,800
Come on, I'm shooting a reel!

219
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,300
What's wrong with him?

220
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,350
Is something wrong?

221
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,780
Hey.

222
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm sorry if I cut you off.

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,850
Do you have a moment?

224
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,690
Yeah, sure. L-Let's go.

225
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,400
Thank you for accepting my suggestion.

226
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,310
You call that a suggestion? That was a threat.

227
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,710
Let's talk about everything here from now on.

228
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,820
Consider it a hideout.

229
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,590
Can we come in here so freely?

230
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah, no one comes here.

231
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,580
You must've come here often.

232
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,360
I came here whenever I'd rather be alone than be in the classroom.

233
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,830
Now, shall we talk about Confession Day?

234
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,810
Did you think of anything?

235
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,000
About what?

236
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,780
Right now, I don't even know what's going on.

237
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,530
I did.

238
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,690
I recorded the video out of shock at the time.

239
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,610
You're the tone-deaf guy.

240
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,040
But how are you a trainee-

241
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,950
Why did you stay quiet even though you knew?

242
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,340
I had no choice but to stay quiet.

243
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,250
So what?

244
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,150
What will you do now?

245
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,650
I was just curious how a trainee-

246
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,420
You'll reveal that it was a lie, too?

247
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,490
What?

248
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,330
T-That's what I wanted to ask!

249
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,360
Forget it.

250
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,320
What do you want?

251
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,940
You're making me sound like I'm really blackmailing you.

252
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,290
I won't tell the others.

253
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,090
And you think anyone will listen to what I say?

254
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,330
I do have a video,

255
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,850
but I'm a total outsider. Unlike you.

256
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,900
Just tell me!

257
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,830
There must be something you want!

258
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,770
Something I want?

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,480
It's my first time talking to her, too.

260
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,260
What's her name?

261
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,200
She's freaking creepy.

262
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,590
Who has spoken to her before?

263
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,440
Something I can't do on my own.

264
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,300
If I have to use someone else's influence...

265
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,090
Is it money?

266
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,340
Fine, I don't know much, but just tell me.

267
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,790
You...

268
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,100
You!

269
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
