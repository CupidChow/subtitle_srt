1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,810
Tomorrow is the much-anticipated Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,910
The streets are filled with the Christmas spirit.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,770
Today is the second day of our Christmas special.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,330
We're joined by Miki Mama! Welcome!

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,630
Hello, everyone!

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,860
Using just this clay pot,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,050
you can make a roast chicken-style dish
that the whole family will love.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,360
Roast chicken in a clay pot...

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,860
The deadline for the list is tomorrow.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,690
My 40th...

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,550
birthday.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,030
- Morning.
- Morning.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,770
- Morning.
- Morning.

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,890
I think people would rather have fried chicken than cake.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,060
- Huh?
- Why?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,210
Don't you think?

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,770
No way.
Huh?

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,370
It's more about the experience of eating it.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,870
Is it a choice between cake and fried chicken?

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,460
Wait, isn't it turkey?

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,950
Oh, turkey? I see.

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,720
But...

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,630
- Morning.
- Morning.

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,930
I'm not doing the list.

25
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,860
I'd already decided that,

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,730
but I can't bring myself to delete it.

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 12)

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:28,950
Hey.

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,450
Oh.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,190
Ah...

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,450
I have a meeting here in a bit.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,210
- I'll get out of your way.
- No, it's fine.

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,190
No, I'll just work over there.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,200
Please don't avoid me.

35
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,390
I'll just work over there.

36
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,070
No...

37
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,990
That's not what I meant.

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,500
The 24th...

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Do you have any plans?

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Huh?

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,540
Wednesday, the 24th.

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,090
It's your birthday, Suzume-san.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
No...

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,930
Tanaka-san, sorry to keep you waiting!

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,330
- Kasukabe-san, hey.
- Hey.

46
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,550
Ah...

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,990
He's a senior colleague from my old department.

48
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,410
I'm Kasukabe.

49
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,610
I'm Tojo.

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,630
He's my boss in my current department.

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,120
Tanaka-san always speaks highly of you.

52
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,750
Not at all, it's the other way around.

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,450
I'm always counting on him to clean up my messes.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,030
This guy's always been reliable.

55
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,950
In fact, he's the one who usually tells me off.

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,450
Huh? Is that true?

57
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,580
It is.

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,070
You know, you may have a gentle way of speaking,

59
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,070
but your jabs are ruthless.

60
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,800
- Oh, right.
- Huh?

61
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
The 24th.

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,760
Should we grab a drink in front of the station?

63
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,700
I heard they have a discount for singles.

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,250
I'm rounding up guys without girlfriends.

65
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,290
Ah, well...

66
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,950
- That day, I...
- Keishi.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,490
He's free on the 24th.

68
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,070
Our department has been really busy lately.

69
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,720
We haven't had any chance to go out.

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
So,

71
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,360
please be sure to take him with you.

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Thank you.

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,560
I'll make the reservation then.

74
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,550
I'll add Tanaka-san for the 24th.

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,690
This is for the best.

76
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,410
This way...

77
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,800
- Hey!
- Why are they both iced?

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,150
'Cause I like them.

79
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,470
Which one do you want?

80
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
I'll take this one.
Okay.

81
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,090
Both of these are intense.

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,020
My daughter keeps telling me I'll get a beer belly.

83
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,990
Sakura-chan?

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,360
No, Aoi-chan.

85
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,520
She says the ideal body has abs.

86
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,630
That sounds like something Aoi-chan would say.

87
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,350
Suzume.

88
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,130
Thanks for the other day.

89
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,510
No, thank you. I had a great time.

90
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,280
That's good.

91
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
What's wrong?

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
It's nothing.

93
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,080
It's just that...

94
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,030
Lately... has something... happened?

95
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,330
What's with the vague question?

96
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,870
It was Sakura-chan.

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,350
She said you seemed down when you went home.

98
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,770
That's not true.

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,410
That girl, Sakura-chan,

100
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,890
she has sharp instincts.

101
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,480
Much sharper than mine.

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,540
You know...

103
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:05,790
I'm always selfishly wishing for your happiness, Suzume.

104
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,760
I'm already... very... happy.

105
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,610
Yeah.

106
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,540
- Yeah.
- Do I have to pay for this?

107
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,990
This is your birthday present.

108
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,300
- It's a day early, you know.
- I did that on purpose.

109
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,870
Kuroki.

110
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah?

111
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Thanks.

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,660
- I'm heading out.
- See you.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,500
It's not Tanaka-san's fault.

114
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,160
It's not anyone's fault.

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,330
I made all these decisions myself.

116
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,820
If I just delete it,

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,480
my 40th...

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
birthday.

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,690
I'm having Christmas dinner with my boyfriend tonight.

120
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,170
So it ended up being a Christmas present.

121
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,970
Akane-chan.
Um...

122
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,040
Do you want to have dinner together tonight?

123
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,520
Oh, but today...

124
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,130
It's Christmas Eve, but I have to work, you know.

125
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,780
You still want to ask me out, knowing that?

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,300
- You idiot.
- What?

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,670
Of course I do.

128
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,880
Tojo-san.

129
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,290
I've sent over the influencer list.

130
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,220
Got it. I'll check it tomorrow.

131
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,050
Yes, sir.

132
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,590
- Um...
- Everyone.

133
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,970
Since it's Christmas Eve today,

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
let's head home early.

135
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,450
I still have work to do...
I have to at least finish this.

136
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,530
No way.

137
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,020
Isn't it annoying?

138
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:44,960
No.

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,470
- I can finish if I'm under pressure.
- I'm putting you under pressure right now.

140
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,370
Hurry up.

141
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,930
That's true, but...

142
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,690
Let's just finish our work first.

143
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,120
Almost sold out!

144
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,510
Chicken legs, half price!

145
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,940
Welcome back.

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,730
Good evening.

147
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,160
I've got chicken legs.

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,020
Buy one. It's Christmas Eve, after all.

149
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,340
A Christmas cake?

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
Ah... something like that.

151
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,710
I've got something good here, too.

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,910
A little present for you.

153
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,340
Look! Candles!

154
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,710
Huh?

155
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,500
Are these for birthdays?

156
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,820
Ah, it's fine.

157
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,040
It's just like any other day.

158
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,310
But it's still delicious like this.

159
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,520
My 40th birthday.

160
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,950
Just like this...

161
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,340
Okay, smile!

162
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,090
I told you not to take my picture.

163
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,500
You have to cherish every moment of daily life.

164
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,920
I won't forget.

165
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,270
'Cause I'm the one who caught it.

166
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,660
You look just like a dad on vacation.

167
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,250
You've really been paying attention to me, haven't you?

168
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,930
Huh?

169
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,010
Does it bother you?

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
For today...

171
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,040
let's leave it at this.

172
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,520
I don't want you to think I only came here for that.

173
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
Why do you have to do everything by yourself?

174
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,560
Please don't get used to it.

175
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,090
At times like this,

176
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,270
you're supposed to rely on others.

177
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
This...

178
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,180
it's not something you can do alone, is it?

179
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,320
Tojo-san.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,410
Good evening, Suzume-san.

181
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,670
Being prepared...

182
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,820
Being prepared... you don't need that at all!

183
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,510
Just being with you is enough for me, Suzume-san.

184
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,820
Suzume... Suzume-san!

185
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,740
That's right.

186
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,110
Suzume-chan.

187
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't give up.

188
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,600
You have to tell him how you really feel.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Keishi!

190
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Keishi!

191
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Keishi!

192
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Keishi!

193
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
Suzume-san...

194
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,290
Suzume-san...

195
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,860
Why...

196
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,460
I felt I had to tell you properly.

197
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,280
Even though you...

198
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,700
you've been trying so hard to face this...

199
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,970
But I'm the one who's been running away.

200
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,210
I have to tell you the truth.

201
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,670
Okay.

202
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,830
I'm here.

203
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I'm listening.

204
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
I...

205
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,320
I deleted the list.

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,000
I thought if I just erased it all...

207
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,230
everything about the list,

208
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,560
and everything about you...

209
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,820
I could forget everything.

210
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,700
I thought I could go back to being on my own...

211
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
But...

212
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,790
I can't.

213
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,730
I can't forget.

214
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,890
The memories we made...

215
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
They're all...

216
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,050
They're still right here,
and I can't make them go away!

217
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,890
Suzume-san...

218
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,430
I'm your boss.

219
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,020
I'm so much older than you.

220
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,420
We shouldn't be doing this.

221
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,460
But...

222
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,940
I can't live without you.

223
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,550
So...

224
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,430
I want to take you home.

225
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
Me too.

226
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,770
I was on my way to your place, Suzume-san.

227
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,320
Keishi.

228
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:32,710
Someone might see...

229
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,210
I don't care if they see.

230
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,380
I don't care what they say.

231
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,820
If something happens...

232
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,290
then...

233
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,980
we'll figure it out together.

234
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,880
Together.

235
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,470
Okay...

236
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,600
Suzume-san...

237
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,030
You're 40.

238
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
So, four candles.

239
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,250
Happy birthday, Suzume-san.

240
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,700
I'm so glad I made it.

241
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Thank you.

242
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,680
Did you make a wish?

243
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,740
My wish...

244
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,610
I'm about to make it.

245
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,810
Huh?

246
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,250
Keishi,

247
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,800
be my boyfriend.

248
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Yes.

249
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,370
Happy birthday, Suzume-chan.

250
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Good morning.

251
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,760
Suzume-san.

252
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:45,970
Did you sleep well?

253
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,570
I slept great.

254
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,750
- Oh, they both look so good!
- Which two are they?

255
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,950
Strawberry and melon.

256
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,410
- This is such a hard choice.
- I know, I can't decide.

257
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,900
If we don't decide soon, our lunch break will be over.

258
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,760
You're right.

259
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,090
But I want both.

260
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,470
If it were me,

261
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,820
I'd probably go with strawberry.

262
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,190
Then...

263
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,710
The melon is tempting, but I'll go with strawberry...

264
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Ready to order?

265
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,090
- Excuse me, we're ready to order.
- Certainly.

266
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,120
What can I get for you?

267
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,460
I'll have the strawberry parfait, please.

268
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,790
Okay, one strawberry parfait.

269
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,000
And for you?

270
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,120
- And one muskmelon parfait, please.

271
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,240
One muskmelon parfait.

272
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,840
- Yes, that'll be all.
- Okay.

273
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,150
- I'll be right back with those.
- Thank you.

274
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,090
Is it because I couldn't decide?

275
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I can't wait.

276
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,990
Whoa...

277
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
Sembikiya!

278
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,070
You know it's gonna be good.

279
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,860
Here is your strawberry parfait.

280
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,180
- And your muskmelon parfait.
- Thank you.

281
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,630
Excuse me.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

282
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,510
Whoa! It's beautiful!

283
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,710
This is amazing...

284
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,750
It looks so delicious!

285
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,690
Okay, well...

286
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,030
Let's dig in.

287
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,330
- This is so good!
- So good!

288
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,620
Incredible.

289
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,100
What are you looking at?

290
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,610
You're just so cute.

291
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,870
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,720
There's nothing cute about a 40-year-old man.

293
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Huh? Why not?

294
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,940
It doesn't matter if you're one or 40.

295
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,350
The person you love always looks cute.

296
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,510
This is really good.

297
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,610
It is.

298
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,030
Hey, stop taking pictures!

299
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,420
But you look great.

300
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,890
Now that we've checked "parfait" off the list,

301
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,530
what's next?

302
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,230
Should we make a "Things to Do Before 41" list?

303
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
No.

304
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,510
We don't need a list.

305
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,400
As long as I'm with you,

306
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,390
I'm happy no matter what we do.

307
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,430
Yeah.

308
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,790
This is my...

309
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,460
happy, undramatic, everyday life.

310
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
10 Things I Want to Do Before I'm 40
