1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,100
Good morning.

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,450
That day...

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,250
It was my first time.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,950
I'd finally managed to confess my true feelings.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,930
To the person I like.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,070
And we were like this...

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,160
So I decided...

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,310
I'd make absolutely sure no one at work found out.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,540
But in the end...

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,910
I still couldn't bring myself to tell him.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,010
Morning.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,080
Morning.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,760
Good morning.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,420
It feels a bit lonely, you know?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Huh?
Huh?

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,060
No warm smile from Tojo-san today?

17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:00:59,970
Oh...

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,550
Yeah.

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,380
He's on a business trip to Osaka.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,850
Lucky him.

21
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,510
Really?

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,430
Isn't the travel exhausting?
And packing is such a hassle.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,310
I guess that's true...

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,250
Didn't you go get the family register?

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,090
Yeah, it's fine.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,220
I'll call the realtor.

27
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,700
Okay.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,300
It's fine.

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,390
I'll take care of the moving arrangements.

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,250
No, I said it's fine.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,480
Oh, sorry.

32
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,620
I know it's been hard on you, Yugo.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 8)

34
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,460
Good work today.

35
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,130
Sorry.

36
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,370
After my appointments today, I'm thinking of heading straight home. Is that okay?

37
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:57,960
Sure.
Okay.

38
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,870
- Oh, Utagawa-san.
- Yes?

39
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,130
What about the materials
for the presentation the day after tomorrow?

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh, no problem!
I'll have them done by the end of today, so tomorrow...

41
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,490
That's our Utagawa-san. Always so efficient.

42
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,490
Um...
There's a document on my desk...

43
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,630
- You know...
- Hm?

44
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,030
That phrase, "it's fine"...

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,240
It's kind of your go-to phrase, isn't it?

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,480
Huh?

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,210
Well, I'm heading out.

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,830
Take care!

49
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,320
I can't exactly say "it's a problem," can I?

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,210
I am 29, after all.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,330
That's true.

52
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,660
Same here.

53
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,190
Wait, you two...

54
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,350
are 29?
Yes.

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,940
Yeah. Why do you ask?

56
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,480
In that case...

57
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,740
Why don't we go for a drink tonight?

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,440
Tanaka-san's girlfriend
is our age.

59
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
Right, right, right.

60
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,290
So, we've been going out for about three months.

61
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,920
But I feel like
we haven't gotten any closer emotionally.

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,600
If anything, she feels more distant.

63
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,690
Yesterday, for example...
I texted her "Good night."

64
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,140
And she's left me on read ever since.

65
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,140
What is up with that?

66
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,030
Hey, don't ignore me!

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,440
Come on, you're the same age.
You should have some idea, right?

68
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,220
That's a pretty broad generalization.

69
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,380
Anyway...

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,350
It's just that...

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,480
the level of affection feels... off.

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,890
It's making me really insecure.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,180
That feeling...

74
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,260
I get it.

75
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,710
Me too.

76
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,180
Hm?

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,290
You...

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,500
Sounds like you've found someone special, huh?

79
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,880
Not yet...
Not yet?

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,190
- Not yet!
- What do you mean, 'not yet'?

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,430
Not yet means not yet.

82
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,370
Huh? But...

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
you just said...

84
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,580
"I get it," didn't you?

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,520
That was...

86
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,130
generally speaking.

87
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,950
- Huh? Generally speaking?
- Yeah, generally speaking.

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,050
I'm just saying...

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,490
just because you're dating doesn't mean your feelings
for each other will always have the same intensity, right?

90
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,710
No?

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,770
Right?

92
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,530
They won't.

93
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,550
Definitely not.

94
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,620
Huh?

95
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,210
So then...

96
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,550
am I...

97
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,660
just supposed to feel insecure forever?

98
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,580
Pacing.

99
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,590
It's different for everyone.

100
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,280
I'd keep wondering what you were thinking.

101
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,120
I've been thinking about it nonstop.

102
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,250
My heart's been pounding.

103
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,060
If you don't talk it out,

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
you'll never know what they're thinking.

105
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
It's not easy, though...

106
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,700
Well...

107
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,800
Um...

108
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,820
(Takahashi Yugo Calling)
- What should I say? - You'll have to figure that out yourself.

109
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,830
Yeah.

110
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,960
- You've had too much to drink.
- I'm going to take this call outside.

111
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,170
- Take your time.
- Huh? What's going on?

112
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,720
Yeah.

113
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,020
I might be home late.

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,970
Wait... what do you mean?

115
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Are you saying you don't want to move?

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,850
Wait.

117
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,930
I already told the landlord. It's too late now...

118
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
It's not like that!

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,090
Didn't we already agree on this?

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,000
- Where to next? Where to next?
- One more bar, one more bar!

121
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
Yugo, I get it.

122
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,190
It's okay.

123
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,980
Yeah.

124
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,510
Let's talk about it properly tomorrow night.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,540
But you said you wanted to get married...

126
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,310
Oh, Tanaka-san.

127
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,630
He can't even hold his liquor,
but he's drinking so fast.

128
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,930
I'm the one who needs to get drunk.

129
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,750
You don't look okay.

130
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,570
Yeah.

131
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,180
My boyfriend...

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,780
He said he doesn't want to move.

133
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,070
Aren't you two living together now?

134
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,150
We are, yes.

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,470
But I feels like it's coming to nothing.

136
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,620
Going with the flow isn't so bad.

137
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,430
It is bad!

138
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,720
I want to have things settled before I turn 30.

139
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,220
Oh...

140
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,700
The place we're living in now,

141
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,330
the lease is up for renewal next month.

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,380
Thinking about our future,

143
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,540
we thought we'd move somewhere bigger
and spent months looking for a place.

144
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,160
We finally decided on a place
that was convenient for both of us.

145
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,600
And now this.

146
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,120
That's...

147
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,530
really rough.

148
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,580
But still,

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,850
I'm not young enough to throw a tantrum over it,

150
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,580
but I'm not mature enough to just accept it gracefully.

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,540
Being 29...

152
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,860
is so complicated.

153
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,500
Tanaka-san is so lucky to be drunk.

154
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,270
I'm really,

155
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,540
really sorry...

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,080
Does this mean we have to redo everything?

157
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,250
What's wrong?

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,200
For tomorrow's presentation materials,
I found out the data is outdated.

159
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,300
What?

160
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,380
The person in charge just contacted me.

161
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,990
They said the numbers in the materials are wrong.

162
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,500
Wait...

163
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,620
But this isn't our fault, right?

164
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,160
- Anyone could make that mistake.
- You mean you could.

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,010
That's harsh.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,340
Utagawa-san is always so meticulous.

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
I was too careless.

168
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,300
It's my fault.
No.

169
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,270
It was my mistake.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,590
I am so sorry.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,710
Hello, Tojo-san.

172
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,230
Sorry to bother you during your business trip.

173
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,160
Yes.

174
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,160
Thank you so much.

175
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,070
I'm putting you on speaker.

176
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,310
Hello?

177
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,180
Utagawa-san, are you there?

178
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,030
Tojo-san, I'm so sorry!

179
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,580
No, it was my oversight. It's my fault.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,760
They said it'll be fine as long as
we can fix it by tomorrow morning.

181
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,040
Can you manage the workload?

182
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,860
No problem.

183
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,620
Right.

184
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,670
It's not "no problem".

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,630
It must be tough for you to handle it alone.

186
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,090
No, this was my mistake.

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,490
I'll pull an all-nighter or whatever it takes.
I'll get it done.

188
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,250
Keishi.

189
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,500
Yes.

190
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,140
Can you help with the data analysis?

191
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,300
Of course.

192
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh.
I'll help too.

193
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,680
You helped me out yesterday, after all.

194
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,970
Thanks, Keishi.
And is that Tanaka?

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,550
Yes, it is.
That's a huge help.

196
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,000
Yoshizawa will take the lead.

197
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm counting on you.

198
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,340
I'll contact you all after the dinner party.

199
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,400
Okay.

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,270
Tojo-san, and everyone... thank you so much.

201
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,640
I appreciate all your help.

202
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,880
Alright.

203
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's get started.

204
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,560
Okay.

205
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,700
(Incoming call from Takahashi Yugo)

206
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,000
Keishi.

207
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,550
How long will the simulation analysis take?

208
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,200
About...

209
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,660
Under 30 minutes.

210
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,070
Put it in the shared folder when you're done.

211
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,390
Got it.

212
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,120
We're finally halfway there...

213
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,550
Let's take a quick break.

214
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,120
Want to go for a coffee?

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,910
Good idea.

216
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,300
I left Kuroki in charge of the dinner party
and came back to the hotel.

217
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,010
Give me something to do, too.

218
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,080
Are you serious?

219
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,210
How can I help?

220
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,940
Tojo-san.

221
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,620
Why are you...

222
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,190
What's left to do?

223
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,280
The cross-analysis.

224
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,300
The data is already in the shared folder.

225
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,240
Got it.
Alright then.

226
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,650
I'll keep you posted on my progress.

227
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,220
Thank you so much!

228
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,860
Everyone.

229
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,180
Just one last push and we're done.

230
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,840
We're...

231
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,080
a team.

232
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,320
That's right.

233
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,350
We...

234
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,430
Even if we're in different places, we're still a team!

235
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,870
I don't know why,

236
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,110
but this feels like a scene from a teen drama.

237
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,530
Alright!

238
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,380
Let's buckle down and get this done!

239
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,430
Focus!

240
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,380
Right!

241
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,700
I've uploaded the cross-analysis statistics
to the shared folder.

242
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,930
Could you take a look?

243
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,790
Sure.

244
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,550
The final check...

245
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,900
is all yours, Udagawa-san.

246
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,160
Understood.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
Udagawa-san.

248
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,770
Take your time.

249
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,470
If there are any mistakes, we can always fix them.

250
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,930
Right!

251
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,150
Okay.

252
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,550
It looks good.

253
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,000
We're done.

254
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,700
Great work, everyone.

255
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,010
It says, "You all worked so hard..."

256
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,580
Thank you so much.

257
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,800
You too, everyone.

258
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,440
Thank you all, really.

259
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,490
- Great work.
- You too.

260
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,900
Well...

261
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,930
Tojo-san, it really felt like...

262
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,320
you were right here with us.

263
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,330
Thank you so much for that.

264
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,160
Don't mention it.

265
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,830
You were a huge help.

266
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,530
Thanks for staying up so late with me.

267
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,200
Of course.

268
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,880
Udagawa.

269
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,550
You were on a roll back there.

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,560
That was all thanks to everyone else.

271
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,440
Honestly,

272
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,340
I almost gave up halfway through.

273
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,550
But...

274
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,940
when I got that message from Tojo-san,

275
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,180
I felt this fire light up inside me.

276
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,390
I just got so fired up.

277
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,780
I see.

278
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,710
Well, I'm going to head out.

279
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,250
Wait.

280
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,720
Can you stay here... with me, for a little while?

281
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,710
Sure.

282
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,130
Hey.

283
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,080
I already said I'm sorry.

284
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,900
No, just calm down.

285
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,180
I told you, it's not like that.

286
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,740
Me?

287
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm not fine at all.

288
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm completely...

289
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,900
not fine.

290
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,430
Mm.

291
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,950
Fine. Let's just do it.

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,710
Let's break up.

293
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,020
He wants to break up.

294
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,810
It's over now, either way.

295
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,520
Utagawa.

296
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,910
That was so cool.

297
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,880
So incredibly cool.

298
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,790
Being able to make that decision...

299
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,470
I think I have Tojo-san to thank for that.

300
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll be fine.

301
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,490
How can you be fine?

302
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,950
Take your time.

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
You don't have to pretend you're okay.

304
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,820
And you don't have to put on a brave face.

305
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,830
Tojo-san helped me see things clearly.

306
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,370
Yeah.

307
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,160
Yeah!

308
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,410
What was I in such a hurry for?

309
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,170
Rushing to move out, to get married...

310
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,050
I was so stupid.

311
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,830
I get anxious sometimes, too.

312
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,380
You do?

313
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:40,970
Yeah.

314
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm still a work in progress.

315
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,770
But...

316
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,210
the person I want to walk alongside...

317
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,380
is him.

318
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,490
So now...

319
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,650
I want us to go at our own pace...

320
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,370
and enjoy the journey.

321
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,090
You found a good one, Keishi.

322
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,550
You think so?

323
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,760
Yeah.

324
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,650
As for me...

325
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,360
I've never even thought about matching someone's pace.

326
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,000
I just always charge ahead on my own.

327
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,220
So...

328
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,210
I'll spend tonight reflecting on that...

329
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,660
and keep moving forward tomorrow.

330
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,810
Anyway...

331
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,110
I'm gonna grab one more drink and head home.

332
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,700
Thanks.

333
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,650
- Good night.
- You too.

334
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,260
Morning.
Good morning.

335
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,660
Tojo-san.

336
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,500
About the data...

337
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,810
I'm so sorry for all the trouble I caused.

338
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,610
And about last night...

339
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,030
thank you so much.

340
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,330
Utagawa-san.

341
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,460
You did great.

342
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,810
I'll be there with you for the presentation, so don't worry.

343
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,730
Tojo-san.

344
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:04,800
Morning.
Good morning.

345
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,440
I thought you weren't coming back until this afternoon.

346
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,400
I didn't expect you to rush back so early.

347
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,520
Oh, well...

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,850
It's just that...

349
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,650
Ah!

350
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,630
It's Tojo-san in the flesh!

351
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,170
What do you mean, "in the flesh"?

352
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,510
Here, I brought pork buns for everyone.
We can have them for lunch.

353
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,240
Thank you!

354
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,500
Oh, Yoshizawa.

355
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,670
Sorry, I know you have a lot going on at home.

356
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,040
Wow, they're from 551!

357
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,770
Thank you so much.

358
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,350
He's so thoughtful.

359
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,980
Tojo-san is just incredible.

360
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
I swear, he's unbeatable.

361
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,660
Tojo-san.

362
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,980
What's wrong?

363
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,030
Did I make a mistake?

364
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,290
No, that's not it.

365
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,430
You didn't sleep at all, did you?

366
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,070
Well...

367
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,750
I pulled an all-nighter.

368
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Please take care of yourself.

369
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,840
Thanks.

370
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Um...

371
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,290
There's something I wanted to tell you.

372
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,870
I'm...

373
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,550
To be Tojo-san's...

374
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,350
I'm so happy I get to work for you.

375
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,330
Well then.
I'll get back to my desk now.

376
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,920
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

377
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,250
Boss and subordinate on weekdays.

378
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,620
And on weekends...

379
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,490
lovers.

380
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,870
That's right, Suzume-chan.

381
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,160
With Keishi,

382
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,040
I'm sure it'll all work out.

383
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm home, Suzuko!

384
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,530
Oh, my.

385
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,030
Oh no, Suzume-chan.

386
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,870
If you fall asleep out here,

387
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,880
you'll catch a cold!

388
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,580
Wake up.

389
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,870
Come on, wake up.

390
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,200
(Next Episode)
I was so careful to hide it.

391
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,890
Is something wrong?

392
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,760
Let's not see each other on weekends for a while.

393
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,580
I...

394
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,250
am better off alone.
