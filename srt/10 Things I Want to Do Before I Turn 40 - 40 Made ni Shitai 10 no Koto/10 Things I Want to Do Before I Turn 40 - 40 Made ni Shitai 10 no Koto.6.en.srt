1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,130
Sigh, having a girlfriend really isn't easy.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,510
We've gone on so many dates already,
I'm about to get anemic.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,140
Tanaka-san, what do you usually do on your dates?

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,830
Huh?

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,970
First off, of course we go for a drive, right?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,610
I even went out of my way to rent a car.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,970
And then we have a stylish lunch at a café by the beach.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,170
Of course, I paid for everything.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,610
Oh wow, that sounds like a lot of work.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,300
I didn't expect you to be the kind of person
who gives so much.

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:23,860
Exactly.
By the way, you're basically just showing off, aren't you.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,590
Of course not!

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,050
By the way, how are things going on your end?
Huh?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,070
I'm the type who wants to make the wishes
of the person I like come true.

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,040
Huh?

16
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,290
Hey, what do you mean by that?

17
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,040
What exactly do you mean by that?

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,380
Now that I think about it,

19
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,810
ever since I started working on the list with Keishi...

20
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,570
my daily life has become more colorful and fulfilling too.

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,710
Delicious.

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,670
Got some sauce on you.

23
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,080
What should we do next?

24
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,280
Starting with the takoyaki party...

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,490
and then having fun at the ocean park...

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,660
Stop filming already.

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,070
This is way too old-fashioned.

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,950
One iced dark chocolate mocha cream frappé.

29
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,260
I also got to try the amazing custom order I've always dreamed of.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,050
And I bought new clothes.

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,740
You really have been paying attention to me all this time.

32
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,390
This weekend...

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,060
What should I do with Keishi?

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,850
If you work on weekdays and go out on a date
every weekend, wouldn't that be exhausting?

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,740
No, no, no, not at all.
That's a date, you know?

36
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,440
Yeah, that's true...

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,550
If it were me, rather than doing something special,

38
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,940
I want to just relax at home too.

39
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,060
Yeah, that's true...

40
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,970
I think spending ordinary moments together
can be really nice too.

41
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,580
Yeah.

42
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,270
Hey, hey!

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,390
So that's how you guys feel…

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,600
You're in the honeymoon phase right now.

45
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,620
- So this is pretty good too…
- Suzume!

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,260
What is it?

47
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,960
You look so troubled.

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,510
Are you stressing about relationship stuff?

49
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,340
What are you talking about?

50
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,750
What you just said could be considered harassment, you know.

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,020
Just kidding, just kidding!

52
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,660
You're probably stressing over
some trivial little thing again, aren't you?

53
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,160
Sorry, I'm just a petty person.

54
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,880
Huh?

55
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,730
Lately, you just seem...

56
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,180
Did you gain weight?

57
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:16,960
Huh?

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,620
See, it's all sticking out.

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,750
- Stop poking me like that!
- Why don't you feel it yourself.

60
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,400
Stop pinching me already!

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
-It's so soft~
-That's enough!

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,580
What is it?

63
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,010
- No, no, you don't need to squeeze it.
- It's super soft~.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,920
No need to move up and down.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,940
Try touching mine.

66
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,370
- It's really hard.
- Yeah, it's hard, right.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 6)

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,300
(Try every cake in the department store food court)

69
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,950
That's actually pretty exhausting.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,390
It's fine, it's really not a big deal.

71
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,320
Lately, I feel like my belt has gotten tighter.

72
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,810
Next week...

73
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,020
During the health checkup,
they'll also check if you have metabolic syndrome.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,260
Ah.

75
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,100
Is it that thing you have to do once you turn 40?

76
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,210
Isn't it better than doing nothing at all?

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,290
As long as it's Tojo-san, I don't care.

78
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,200
What are you talking about?

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,050
You never gain any weight at all.

80
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,360
Do you do any weight training or something like that?

81
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,360
I don't do that.

82
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,120
I'd probably only do it if a friend invited me on the weekend.

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Cake feast of the mall food court this weekend
will have to be put on hold for now.

84
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,720
Now's not the time for this kind of thing.

85
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,350
I just came up with a great idea.

86
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,280
For real?

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
Hey, are we really going to do this?

88
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,900
It burns a lot of calories.

89
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
And it's a lot of fun.

90
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,180
I've never played before.

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,180
How about you, Keishi?

92
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,780
Actually, I've only played it two or three times
because my friends brought me along.

93
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,620
But it's no problem.

94
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,680
I'll teach you.

95
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,890
No, no, no... I don't want to!

96
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,470
Don't you want to lose weight?

97
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,610
- Hey! Dummy! Stop messing around! You idiot, cut it out!
- Come on, come on~

98
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
We can play just the two of us.

99
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll give it a try...

100
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,330
Okay.

101
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,400
Then let's go.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,540
Sorry, I'm late.

103
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,470
Yeah.

104
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,020
You didn't wear that on purpose, did you?

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,020
What does it matter?

106
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,250
As long as it's comfortable to move around in, it's fine!

107
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,790
Let's get started.

108
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,750
It's really cute, though.

109
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,620
Let's start with some stretching exercises.

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,800
You should've said so earlier!

111
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,910
You're really full of energy.

112
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,280
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

113
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,650
It hurts...

114
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,650
If it hurts, that just means your muscles are happy.

115
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,590
One more time.

116
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,690
It hurts! This is not fun at all!
Not fun at all, I'm really not having any fun!

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,180
Go for it, whatever you do, always give it your all.
Let's do it one more time.

118
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,690
One more time…

119
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,840
- 1, 2, 3, 4…
- It hurts, it hurts!

120
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,280
- 5, 6, 7, 8…
- It's taking too long…

121
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,420
Taking too long…

122
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,990
Heave-ho.

123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,200
You did great.

124
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,800
Next, bring your knees together.

125
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,980
- Knees?
- Yeah, just like that, make circles.

126
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,130
Okay.

127
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,010
Actually, since there's a lot of up and down movement,
your knees might bump into each other.

128
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,490
Oh… that looks pretty intense.

129
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,530
Alright, now switch and spin in the opposite direction.

130
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,250
I just have a feeling.

131
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,200
The size of our circles is different.

132
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,290
Legs?

133
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,790
It's your legs, and your body too. You're just bigger in size.

134
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,250
Alright, let's do some more stretching exercises.

135
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:10,750
Okay.
Open it.

136
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,190
So long.
Like this.

137
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,930
Let's get started quickly.

138
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,010
Okay.

139
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,170
Hold it straight like this.

140
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,300
And then from above.

141
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,740
Just like holding it gently.

142
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,530
That's it.

143
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,530
And then gently with your index finger...

144
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,460
Yes, just like that.

145
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,050
I'll start playing first, and you can just pick any spot
and try hitting the ball back against the wall.

146
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,790
Got it.

147
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,060
Alright, here we go.

148
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,530
What a pity! That last swing was really good.

149
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,450
Also, make sure to pay attention to how the racket feels in your hand.

150
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,620
The feel of the racket...
Yeah.

151
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,940
The feel of the racket.

152
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,100
- Okay, let me try again.
- Got it.

153
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm about to serve!

154
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,010
Come on.

155
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,240
Nice shot.

156
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,620
Not bad at all.

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,760
No, not really. I just did what Keishi said
and focused on the feel of the racket.

158
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,280
The best thing about Tojo-san is your straightforward personality.

159
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,150
Keishi's a great teacher, that's all.

160
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,370
Alright, so next.

161
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,790
Should we keep rallying?

162
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,350
I understand.
Then let's give it a try.

163
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,320
Okay.

164
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,710
Go.

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,900
One.

166
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,900
Two.

167
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,690
Three.

168
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,720
Four.

169
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,460
That's impressive.

170
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Alright, then.

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,300
If you can go back and forth 20 times in a row...

172
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,420
we'll go buy cakes at the food court
in the department store next week.

173
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:34,750
Cakes...

174
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,580
Hey, when you hit 20 times, just go a little easy, okay!

175
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,050
Set your goals a little higher.

176
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,720
We're about to start.

177
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,780
Okay.

178
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,390
It's a deal!

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,500
Of course, it's a deal.

180
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,550
Time to serve!

181
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,550
Here we go.

182
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,840
One.

183
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Two.

184
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,310
Three.

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,410
Four.

186
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,670
Five.

187
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,080
Six.

188
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,330
Seven…

189
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,810
Tojo-san.

190
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,910
You could have caught the ball just now.

191
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,640
No…

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,550
Let's try again.

193
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,800
One.

194
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,670
Seventeen.

195
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,440
Eighteen.

196
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,900
Nineteen.

197
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,150
Last shot!

198
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,290
Twenty!

199
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,080
Alright!

200
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,340
Let's do one more round.

201
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,710
Tojo-san.

202
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,160
What's wrong? You're done already?

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,830
Didn't we already make it to 20?

204
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,090
This devil coach.

205
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,550
That's true.

206
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,300
I really can't go on anymore.

207
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,090
My legs are so sore.

208
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,260
You really gave it your all.

209
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,540
Wow!

210
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:24,980
So tired.

211
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,440
It's so hot.

212
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,310
Sorry.

213
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,510
Sorry to keep you waiting.

214
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,680
Sure enough, it started raining after all.

215
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,040
Wow, it's coming down even harder than I expected.

216
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,990
What should we do next?

217
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,510
Last time I was here, I stopped by a nearby café for a bit.

218
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,870
But it doesn't really feel like that kind of vibe right now.

219
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,960
So this is what your usual weekends are like.

220
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,710
Huh?

221
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,690
Somehow, I feel that going like this isn't so bad either.

222
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,700
Like this?

223
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,700
Yeah.

224
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,000
I mean... spending your everyday life together with you.

225
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,900
No...

226
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,430
I mean, lately...

227
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,770
this whole time...

228
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,900
Have I been making you stay with me this whole time,
helping me complete my bucket list?

229
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,540
The list...

230
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,540
How many are left again?

231
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,060
Uh...

232
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,750
How many are left…

233
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,690
Six?

234
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,730
No, that's not right.

235
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,780
It should be five, right.

236
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,440
I see.

237
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,430
There are still five left...

238
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,140
If only you had written a few more back then…

239
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,970
Do you want to come over to my place?

240
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,220
Huh?

241
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,500
I mean...

242
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,440
Didn't we just make a deal?

243
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,800
If we could rally up to 20 times in a row,

244
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,130
we're going to try every single cake
in the department store food court?

245
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,320
It's okay to do that today, right?

246
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,510
If it's in the department store food court,
we don't have to worry about the rain.

247
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,530
Okay.

248
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,250
Let's go.

249
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,030
Okay.

250
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,940
Stepping on shadows is really a lot of fun.

251
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,010
This calendar is really dreamy.

252
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,900
Hey, stop staring!

253
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,530
I didn't notice it the last time I was here.

254
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,410
Because that time was mainly a takoyaki party.

255
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,740
No...

256
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,730
You really did write down our date, didn't you.

257
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,530
It's only written here.

258
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,860
Because it's a list.

259
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,570
Trying all the cakes from
the department store food court is number 6, right?

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
The pace was actually that fast.

261
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,700
Trying every cake...

262
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,630
But Tojo-san, you really do love dreamy things.

263
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,410
At the plush aquarium in the ocean theme park,

264
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,040
weren't you super excited?

265
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,580
Cute things are just cute.

266
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,220
But...

267
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,510
I really do like this guy the most after all.

268
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,620
Because I'm right here with you.

269
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,470
And that outfit really suits you.

270
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,860
I really do have great taste!

271
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,820
Don't say it yourself.

272
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,540
Before I knew it,

273
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,380
we've already made so many memories together.

274
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,840
Is it good?

275
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,210
This is really good too.

276
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,580
Wait a second.

277
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,720
Delicious.

278
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,920
It's so delicious.

279
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,900
But...

280
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,540
Wait a second...

281
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,220
It looks like finishing it all at once might be a bit tough.

282
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,730
I'll have to do it in several rounds.

283
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,190
And...

284
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,760
Um...

285
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,970
this is no way to lose any weight at all.

286
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,460
Let's just forget about it today.

287
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,520
Forget it.

288
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,810
It's okay for today.

289
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,940
I really moved a lot today.

290
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,340
Yeah.

291
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,600
Let's have something delicious.

292
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,040
Yeah.

293
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,420
Here.

294
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,590
I told you so.

295
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,920
Stop filming me!

296
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
It's not every day we get this chance. Here, take the cake.

297
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,980
Okay.

298
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,580
Not bad.
Alright, that's enough.

299
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,150
You should eat too.

300
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,080
Then I'll just have the strawberry.

301
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,020
So sweet...

302
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,640
I saved it for last on purpose.

303
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,640
Well then.

304
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,160
Do you want to try this too?

305
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,450
Here you go.
It's melted a lot.

306
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,070
Alright, open up.

307
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,870
Don't you think it's really good?

308
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,830
So delicious!
- It's really delicious, isn't it.
- Yeah!

309
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,580
Yeah.

310
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,440
These are fine.

311
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,780
Do you want more coffee?

312
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,820
Then can I have a refill?

313
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,400
Yeah, that's true.

314
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,550
Right.

315
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,720
They're all sweet.

316
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,400
Thank you.

317
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,660
Tojo-san?

318
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,260
This is...

319
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,900
Well, about that.

320
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,310
I bought it on impulse, but it's actually pretty hard.

321
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,200
If you don't do this the right way,
you could hurt your back or waist.

322
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,710
Why don't you give it a try.

323
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
It's okay.

324
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,080
I'll take it slow.

325
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,570
It's not often I get this chance.

326
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,400
Let me take a look.

327
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,090
Swear that you won't laugh.

328
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,760
Okay.

329
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,700
Huh.

330
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,220
It went even more smoothly than I expected.

331
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,650
- Did I do well?
- It looks great.

332
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,570
But you know...

333
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,750
Doing this once is enough.

334
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,270
I definitely can't do this multiple times.
Nope.

335
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,670
But I really think you're amazing.

336
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,360
Ah! But...

337
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,360
Even just doing it once, I feel like my body
is already making crackling sounds.

338
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,420
It's been a long time since I last did this.

339
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,370
Come here.

340
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,240
It hurts...

341
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,380
Are you okay now?

342
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,580
I'm so glad you invited me.

343
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,020
That's not what I meant.

344
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
So what did you mean by that?

345
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,530
Did you only plan to have some cakes?

346
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,370
Don't say things like that, it's mean.

347
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,080
Today...

348
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,000
let's stop here.

349
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,380
I don't want you to think I only came here for that.

350
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:55,850
Well then...

351
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,190
Shall we keep eating cakes?

352
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,240
Thanks for the coffee.

353
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,850
It's really delicious.
The cakes from the department store food court.

354
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,560
Right?

355
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,950
Let's go together next time so we can try them all.

356
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,800
Well...

357
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,590
I had such a great time today.

358
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,390
Whether it's the gym,

359
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,350
or just eating cake at home.

360
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,990
I had a great time too.

361
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,070
Good night.

362
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,640
Suzume-san.

363
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,130
Good night.

364
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,510
Suzume-san...

365
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,540
This is the first time.

366
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,970
Hearing you say my first name.

367
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,840
Suzuko?

368
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,600
I'm sorry, Suzuko.

369
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,630
Suzuko is just as important to me.

370
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,050
Having someone beside as company...

371
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,380
this is enough happiness.

372
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,540
Give it my all.

373
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,700
(Next Episode)
Well then.

374
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:46,920
Here.
I'll leave it at Suzume-san's place.

375
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm here to buy a pillow!

376
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,020
It really makes my heart race.

377
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,050
Being with someone you like...

378
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,700
something like this...

379
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,580
It's really exciting, isn't it?

380
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,700
Oh no.
