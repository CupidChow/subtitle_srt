1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,550
Yeah, no problem over there.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you for helping
me make the adjustments.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Was I played that day?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,570
This list.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,190
Do you want to do it together with me?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm just like Tojo-san.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Alright, I'll hang up now.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,600
Mr. Iwamoto, is that okay?

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,300
It was probably just a joke...

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,800
Takoyaki party and cake

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,479
Have an ice cream sundae with Tojo-san.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,960
Sounds like it would be a lot of fun.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,800
He was probably just joking!

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,900
- Don't mess with my computer.
- This one's already done.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,300
Celebrate my birthday with my partner.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,300
A lover, huh... He never said he
wanted to date me or that he liked me.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Are you willing to trust me now?

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I really don't get that guy.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
I have absolutely no problem holding you.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
What on earth is he thinking?

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Ah! Seriously!

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 2)

23
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
(Takoyaki Party)

24
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Speaking of which...

25
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Speaking of which, Keishi...

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,200
What kind of person is he, really?

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,000
Tojo-san.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,100
I'm heading out for the day.

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Good work.

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Good work.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
As expected, it's just like always.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Keishi always greets people very politely.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,900
Good work.
Huh?

34
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,079
Has Keishi already left?

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,199
Yeah, he said he had plans to meet someone.

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,500
What!

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,299
Is that guy off on another
date with a woman again?

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,900
I have no idea.

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Did something happen?

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
It's nothing.

41
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,660
- Keishi! Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Hey! Thanks for your hard work.

42
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,738
Long time no see.

43
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:05,720
Hey, it hasn't been that long! Didn't
we just see each other not too long ago?

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm really looking forward to it.

45
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,799
Let's go, let's go.

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,009
What do you want to eat?

47
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,370
- Have you decided?
- Yep, all set.

48
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,600
- Pasta!
- Pasta!

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,100
Keishi, he...

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
You're right about that.

51
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,181
Someone like him, who has
so many options to choose from.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How could she ever date an old guy like me?

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Right, Susuko.

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,000
But you still care about
Keishi-kun, don't you?

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,500
This is the progress so far.

56
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,330
To be honest, I think this
event doesn't have enough buzz.

57
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,600
- This is intentional.
- Keishi... he's really good at his job.

58
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,739
What matters most to
the client is the brand.

59
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,000
He always manages to calmly
say exactly what needs to be said.

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,699
- That's the old data.
- Huh?

61
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,009
- This is the latest one.
- Thank you! I really appreciate it~

62
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,950
He's naturally considerate of
others, so people just can't dislike him.

63
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,069
- This is the one Udagawa made for us before, right?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,280
I think it's pretty great.

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,100
And he actually has a
surprisingly clumsy side, too.

66
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
He's got really beautiful hands, too.

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,700
And when he smiles,
he's especially adorable.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
He's also really tall.

69
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,700
He's got great poise, too.

70
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,800
Another good-looking guy.

71
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,199
Ah! Keishi.

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,700
Good job.

73
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
A while ago.

74
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,999
- I went to Hakata.
- Business trip, huh!

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,850
- Yeah, yeah, it was a business trip.
- Thanks for your hard work.

76
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:23,300
- Do you want this?
- Is that okay?

77
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,799
- Have one!
- Then I'll take it, thanks.

78
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,640
Huh? Give it to me!

79
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,100
So of course he's really popular.

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
So...

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's not even a millimeter
of a chance you'd date me.

82
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Tojo-san.

83
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm heading out for the day.

84
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,910
Good job.

85
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:50,000
Thanks for your hard work.

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,660
Good job.

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,800
It's been a week since that day.

88
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Everything is just like usual.

89
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,900
Keishi goes to work and
comes home like usual every day.

90
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Anyway.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
It's like that whole thing
never even happened.

92
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Tojo-san.

93
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
Are we heading to the electronics store?

94
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
An electronics store?

95
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:41,266
The Big Camera across from the station.

96
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's go buy a takoyaki maker.

97
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,692
Could it be... Tojo-san already has one?

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,300
No... I don't.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,700
Why do you want to buy a takoyaki maker?

100
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,000
Because it's the first thing on my list.

101
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,700
He's not even planning to...
Just pretending it never happened!

102
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,699
Which one do you think is better?

103
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,963
No, no.

104
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,801
I looked it up, and it seems like
the smaller ones heat up faster.

105
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,589
But if you want to make really good takoyaki, I've
heard you definitely need to use a gas model.

106
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,524
Hey, wait a second! I'm serious…

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Tojo-san, the goals you set to
accomplish before you turn 40.

108
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
But since I don't have anyone to do
it with, everything's on hold for now.

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
That's right, isn't it?

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Seriously...

111
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,499
Are you saying you want to
check off the list together with me?

112
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
It's fine, don't overthink it.

113
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
Look, this is the gas stove type.

114
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,700
Oh~

115
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,399
Are you an idiot?!

116
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,160
You're only going to use it once, and you're
still going to buy a whole machine just for that!

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,100
Huh! Isn't it actually the opposite?

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,300
If you buy it, you can use it
anytime you want, no problem.

119
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
- Huh?
- No...

120
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:16,615
I just feel like I've never had
that kind of thought before…

121
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Really?

122
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,200
What should I do?
Huh?

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This one.

124
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,569
No, that's not it. If I had to choose
from these, I'd pick this one...

125
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,099
- Sorry about that.
- That was way too fast...

126
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,039
I want this takoyaki maker.

127
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

128
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,024
No, no, no...

129
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Aren't you going to buy it?

130
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I want this one.

131
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,676
You can either take it yourself or have it
delivered. Which option would you prefer?

132
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,829
- I'll pick it up myself.
- I'll pick it up myself.

133
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,830
Alright.

134
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,100
Thank you.

135
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,000
In the end, I still went along
with what he wanted and bought it.

136
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I'll carry it.

137
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,149
No need!

138
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,500
The station is just up ahead.

139
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,780
After all, I'm your subordinate.

140
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,770
Oh... thank you.

141
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
No way.

142
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Keishi is kind to everyone.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
I should probably just
walk you to the station.

144
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Huh?

145
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,900
This guy probably doesn't
live at the same station, right?

146
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,499
Which way is it?

147
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
- My place is pretty much this way...
- Got it.

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Are you saying you're going to help
me carry it all the way to my place?

149
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,679
Is it this way?

150
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,500
Yes, this is the place.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,249
Where's the supermarket?

152
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,300
- The supermarket's just up ahead…
- OK.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Huh?

154
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
No way.

155
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,100
Oh! Are we here?

156
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Huh? Is it happening today?

157
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,281
You're only telling me now?

158
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,809
Let's hurry up.

159
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,900
The octopus will thaw.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Young people are really something else.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,199
Sorry to interrupt.

162
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,349
I need to tidy up a bit over here.
Give me five minutes.

163
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,699
It's okay, you don't have
to worry about me. I'm fine.

164
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,200
No way! I told you to wait five minutes!

165
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,500
Aaaaahhhhh!!!!

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,580
That's too much... Didn't I
tell you to wait five minutes?

167
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,349
It's like a dream.

168
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,279
Oh, no! This actually belongs to my nephew.

169
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,700
I see.

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So cute!

171
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Susuko!

172
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:51,499
Oh! Sorry.

173
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Huh?

174
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
What did you say?

175
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
No, that's not it...

176
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Have you given it a name?

177
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,400
This plush toy.

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Wow! So cute!

179
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Well then.

180
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,500
Are we about to start?

181
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,800
Tojo-san? Are you ready to get started?

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,360
You're really skilled!

183
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

184
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Are you someone who doesn't cook?

185
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,560
No, I can cook.

186
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,200
That's a surprise, but nice!

187
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
No, not really. I can only
make some simple dishes.

188
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,000
How about you?

189
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,000
Me? I always cook for myself.

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,269
I have a super strong-willed twin sister.

191
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,630
Ever since we were kids, she taught me that
a man who can't do housework is useless.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,400
A container for holding green onions.

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,299
Well... this one will do.

194
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,270
Thank you.

195
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,600
A twin sister?

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

197
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,010
Even though they're twins,
we actually don't look alike at all.

198
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,600
Our personalities are
completely opposite, but...

199
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,689
The only thing they really have in
common is how strong-willed they both are.

200
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,010
Not long ago, she also dragged me out and
insisted I help her figure something out.

201
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,394
I was actually pretty
tired at that time…

202
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait, don't tell me… you met
up with her after work before?

203
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Yes.

204
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,280
- What's up?
- I just happened to see it…

205
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Hey! You should've at least said hi to me!

206
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
Is that so...

207
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:56,000
The twin sister... big sister...

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm not playing around
with women, you know.

209
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
No…

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
Ah...

211
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:15,081
There should be something
else we need to cut, right?

212
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Well then...

213
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,659
I'll cut this.

214
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,799
Should I slice the pickled ginger?

215
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,850
Huh, not going to cut it?

216
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,300
Ready!

217
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,730
Oh! It even comes with a strap for tying.

218
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,789
This is the instruction manual, right?

219
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,809
No, no, that's not right!

220
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,500
The instructions... I never read them.

221
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,499
- That was pretty well done.
- Yeah, really impressive.

222
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,700
- Ah!
- Hm?

223
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,399
So cute!
Having this really makes a difference...

224
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,420
And then this one goes here too.
Now it's perfect.

225
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,070
I can really feel the
excitement kicking in now.

226
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,700
Actually, me too.

227
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,150
Hey! Wouldn't it be better
if we made it two layers?

228
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,020
Want to try adding it in?

229
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,820
- Let's just add it in.
- No… wait…

230
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Alright.

231
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,385
Toilet paper, toilet paper.

232
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,400
Where is it?

233
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,000
In the back.

234
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,800
Let's turn off the heat for now.

235
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
Ah!

236
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,300
You've still been
keeping this all this time?

237
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,539
Ah... yeah.

238
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,176
I thought it had been
thrown away a long time ago.

239
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,876
If someone gives me something,
there's no way I'd just throw it away!

240
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,626
More important than
that is the toilet paper.

241
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,100
Sorry, here you go.

242
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
And also that...

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,500
Actually, I kind of like it.

244
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Is that so?

245
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,200
Speaking of which...

246
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
You actually still remember
something like that?

247
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:52,991
I won't forget.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,560
Because I was the one who picked it up.

249
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Looks really similar.

250
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,300
No way! Hurry up, hurry up!

251
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,299
Here, give it a spin.

252
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,376
- Thank you.
- Turn the takoyaki.

253
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,839
Hey! But right now... huh?

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,499
Wait, wait, wait a second,
please hold on a moment.

255
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Because we just put it
in, let's wait a little longer.

256
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,400
Ah! Octopus!

257
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,000
- Any kind of yaki is fine.
- If there's no octopus inside, then it's not takoyaki.

258
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,400
Takoyaki.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
You really love taking photos!

260
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,600
Is it ready?

261
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
It's ready.

262
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,730
Alright! I'll put it here so
the sauce doesn't splatter.

263
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,500
- Sorry about that.
- It's fine, no need to apologize.

264
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,000
Alright, that's enough, stop filming me.

265
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Alright...

266
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,900
So, are we ready to dig in?

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm going to dig in.

268
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:04,487
Wow! That looks really hot.

269
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
So hot...

270
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,440
It's really hot, isn't it?

271
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,700
Ah! But...

272
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,200
This is so delicious!

273
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,039
It's incredibly soft and tender inside.

274
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Yeah.

275
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,299
- Wow, this is delicious!
- Freshly made like this is just unfair.

276
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,500
Yeah, it's really something else.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
The whole thing is steaming!

278
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,399
You know... it's really nice that
you always greet people so politely.

279
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
It's actually pretty good.

280
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,090
Huh?
Is that so?

281
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,350
Yeah.

282
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,800
I also said "let's dig in" just now.

283
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,100
Great, I just got a compliment!

284
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,749
Whether it's at the office or
when you're far away from me.

285
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,200
You always make a point to
come over and say hi to me.

286
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
That really made me happy.

287
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,399
When was Tojo-san's last relationship?

288
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Pfft!

289
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,065
Are you okay?

290
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,090
It's nothing...

291
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,500
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

292
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,500
No, that's not it. I just wanted to
know how long you've been single.

293
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,800
It was about ten years ago...

294
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Huh?

295
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,600
For real?!

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,429
Wasn't that before I joined the company?

297
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,430
Yeah.

298
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,700
Even saying it out loud
myself makes me feel sad.

299
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,000
Hey! Are you serious...?

300
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,000
I was just about to ask you
about what you said last time.

301
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,600
Is it all true?

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,080
I'm not sure which one
you're talking about, though.

303
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
But every word of it is true.

304
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:03,507
I realized a long time
ago that Tojo-san is gay.

305
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,300
You know, sometimes women wear
those tops with lower necklines, right?

306
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,979
Because of a client, would the
15th to the 17th work for you?

307
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,049
- This should be totally fine.
- At that time, Tojo-san didn't even sneak a single glance.

308
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,100
…This earlier part is probably the best.

309
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,000
I could tell right away that you
weren't interested in women.

310
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't worry.

311
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm the only one who would
notice something like that.

312
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Is that so?

313
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Me?

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm not ashamed of my own orientation.

315
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I just don't want this to cause any
trouble for the people around me.

316
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
It's the same for Tojo-san, isn't it?

317
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I see.

318
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,088
It's because I realized that.

319
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,500
So that's why Keishi...

320
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,087
Sorry for making you worry.

321
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,900
He really invades other
people's privacy way too much.

322
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
Things like that.

323
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,100
Maybe there have been a
lot of similar situations before.

324
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
Got some sauce on it.

325
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,300
What should we do next?

326
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Keishi may be pretty assertive,
but he's still my subordinate.

327
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,200
I have no idea what he's thinking.

328
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,400
Sea Paradise...

329
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Hakkeijima Sea Paradise.

330
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Not bad!

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What kind of expression should I
have when I see him on Monday...?

332
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm really looking
forward to next Saturday.

333
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
Just like that, he took the lead.

334
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Made plans for next time.

335
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,700
The aquarium...

336
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,600
It almost feels like a date...

337
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,000
It's been a long time
since I've felt this excited.

338
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,600
That's awesome, Suzume-chan!

339
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,299
(Next Episode)
You're dressed just like a dad on vacation.

340
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,319
Is it really that bad?

341
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,589
Amazing! Incredible!

342
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,409
I had an amazing time today.

343
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,299
It's okay even if it's just on a whim.

344
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
Tojo-san.

345
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,920
If you like something, just like it.
There's nothing wrong with that.
