1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,100
And just like that, it was Monday morning.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,000
Honestly, I don't feel the slightest bit
ashamed about my own sexual orientation.

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,500
I just don't want this to make
things awkward for anyone else.

4
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,200
Got some sauce on it.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,300
What should we do next?

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Ocean Park...

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Not bad!

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm really looking
forward to next Saturday.

9
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Ocean Park.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,899
- Are you someone who doesn't cook?
- No, I can cook.

11
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,600
What a surprise, that's pretty good!

12
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,180
Because I was the one who grabbed it.

13
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Looks a lot alike.

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Oh no!

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,800
Safe travels!

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,300
Good morning.

17
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,409
Ah! Good morning.

18
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,709
The weather is really nice today.

19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,710
- I'm heading out now.
- Be careful on the road!

20
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:34,800
It feels like you're really
shining, Suzume-chan.

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Shining bright! Shining bright!

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,300
What kind of expression
should I have when I see him?

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Alright.

24
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Sorry for being rude.

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,990
- Tojo-san.
- Yes.

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,399
N Company said they want to
move the project up by a month.

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,710
Huh?

28
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:15,080
I just got the notification.

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm heading over to N Company now to get
more details. I'll discuss it with you later.

30
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,850
Got it.

31
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,229
I'll keep my phone on. Contact
me right away if anything comes up.

32
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,500
Alright, I'm heading out.

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,130
Tojo-san, this is bad!

34
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,229
The promotional venue at K
Company is no longer available.

35
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,080
What's going on?

36
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,300
There was a fire.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,199
This morning's news.

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,800
Have you contacted K Company?

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,506
I tried calling the person in charge at K
Company, but I haven't been able to get through.

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,499
Wait a little while and
try calling again later.

41
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,399
Also, look for an alternative
venue while you're at it.

42
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Okay.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,569
- Hello, Ms. Udagawa?
- Oh, sorry about that.

44
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,999
I'm in the ambulance right now.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,369
Huh? An ambulance?

46
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,110
Yeah, I fell down the
stairs at the station.

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,969
Are you okay?

48
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,210
Hmm... The sprain is a bit serious, but just to
be safe, I'll need to get my head checked as well.

49
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,320
You really need to get a thorough checkup.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,369
Take it easy and get some rest today. Let
the doctor give you a thorough check-up.

51
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,000
- Yeah, alright.
- Mr. Yoshizawa, Mr. Yoshizawa!

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,499
- What's going on here? This is way too chaotic.
- How about the Garden Hall or Marunouchi Center?

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,020
Where can you even book it right now?!

54
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,999
There's just no time at all...

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
Suzume!

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,429
I'd like to ask you to
take on that new case.

57
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,800
Could you help send some extra people over…

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nothing?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,700
Nothing...

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,300
There's just no time to
think about anything extra.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 3)

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,300
(Ocean Park)

63
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
Give it a little more effort!

64
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm seriously getting numb.

65
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,900
We've got time, we've
got time, we've got time!

66
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,799
Tojo-san, we're really running out of time.

67
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,879
I'll figure out the timing
on my end, don't worry.

68
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,500
Sorry, I'm counting on you.

69
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,400
This...

70
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
All set.

71
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,700
My brain just can't handle this at all...

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,969
Ah! Tojo-san!

73
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,970
Huh?

74
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
We're out of budget.

75
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,020
Then let's cancel the bubble machine
and balloons for the event for now.

76
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,100
Got it, I'll try to take care of it.

77
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,700
I really can't do it anymore...

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
No way~

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
Suzume-chan.

80
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,940
Two days left until we go to
the Ocean Park on Saturday.

81
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,600
Only two days left!

82
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,400
- Ocean Park…
- Yeah!

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,590
Now it all depends on
how K Corporation decides.

84
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,999
I'll do my best to negotiate.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,700
Thanks for your help.

86
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,016
Thanks to your help, things
are finally starting to take shape.

87
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,379
Alright, if anything comes up, I'll contact
you right away. Thank you so much.

88
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,500
I'll be taking my leave now.

89
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
Suzume!

90
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,800
This isn't good!

91
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
What happened now?!

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,060
Look...

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,000
What is this…

94
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,380
This thing is completely ruined.

95
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,600
This too?

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,200
I haven't felt this tired in a long time...

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Sorry, Susuko.

98
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,000
It's tough, isn't it?

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,000
All I do every day is go to
work and then go home...

100
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,800
How about meeting at
Ocean Park at 11 on Saturday?

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,400
It's not just about work.
I need to give it my all here, too.

102
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
Hang in there a little longer, Suzume-chan.
Saturday's almost here.

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,749
Alright, about that matter.
If you can get back to me by the end of today, that'll be fine.

104
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,000
No problem, thank you.

105
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,200
Being able to handle such a heavy
workload without even breaking a sweat...

106
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,771
Truly impressive. I have
so much respect for that.

107
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,119
Alright, thank you.

108
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,200
Sorry for the interruption.

109
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,900
Hey, this is Mr. Shitajo.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,799
Yes, that's right.

111
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
Regarding the promotion of the new product.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Is it okay to finalize the
plan on that side like this?

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
Ah! It's over.

114
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,500
Tomorrow...

115
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Huh?

116
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
What on earth should I wear?

117
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Sorry to keep you waiting...

118
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,299
Alright... good job.

119
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,799
You just want to say it
looks really tacky, right?

120
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,550
Just say it straight out.

121
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,599
Yeah, it's really tacky.

122
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Don't be so blunt about it.

123
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,508
You look just like a dad on vacation.

124
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
Is it really that bad?

125
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Don't just stay silent.

126
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Then let's go.

127
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,120
Don't turn around and laugh!

128
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
No, no.

129
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Speaking of which.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,720
Why did you choose Hakkeijima Sea Paradise?

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,119
No, it's just that I've never
been to the aquarium before.

132
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,399
- Oh, really?
- Hmm...

133
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,500
I was thinking, since it's for work, I
should at least come and check it out once.

134
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Workaholic.

135
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I accidentally lied...

136
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,779
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Here's your Sparrow Baby crepe.

137
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,800
Thank you.

138
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
It's seriously adorable.

139
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,869
Excuse me, I'd like to
order a Sparrow Baby crepe.

140
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,870
Okay.

141
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Tojo-san.

142
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
Hold on a second.

143
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,110
- Hm?
- Could you take a look at this for me?

144
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Ah! No...

145
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,400
Here you go, please enjoy.

146
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,599
No... I don't really feel like eating.

147
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,699
What are you being so polite about?

148
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,500
Isn't today exactly one of those days?

149
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Tojo-san, you really like
dreamy things, don't you?

150
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
No, not really.

151
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,500
You can tell just by looking at that room.
It's way too obvious.

152
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,100
Just eat it.

153
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,360
Stop filming already!

154
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,200
Come on, come on! Look over here!

155
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,150
Not bad!

156
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,570
Where should I start eating this?

157
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,420
Should we start from the top?

158
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,300
You... why are you like this!

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Of course! Where else
would you start eating it from?

160
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Here?

161
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,276
- I said stop filming already.
- Alright, alright.

162
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,890
Suzume-chan and the sparrow.

163
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,800
That's way too old-fashioned.

164
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Here we go!

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,899
Ah! It's at the highest point!

166
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Oh no!

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
That's amazing!

168
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,130
- Okay.
- Ah! That was amazing.

169
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,376
Wow, that's amazing, really amazing!

170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,480
- Keiishi! Stop pretending to pedal.
- I really am pedaling, I really am! Look.

171
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,369
Why am I the only one sitting here?

172
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,000
Riding solo~

173
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
Stop filming!

174
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,749
Next round, next round!

175
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
Lock in! Lock in!

176
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,430
- So cute!
- Actually, that's pretty impressive, isn't it?

177
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,110
Why am I the only one left?

178
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,600
- Finally made it to the end…
- That was seriously so much fun.

179
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,500
So big!

180
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,949
It's even bigger than I expected.

181
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,010
That's amazing!

182
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,290
Let's take a picture.

183
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,779
Hey, take the shot over here!

184
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,400
Hurry, take the shot!

185
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,200
- Oh! This could turn out to be an amazing photo.
- Really!

186
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,090
Wow, that's amazing!
That's incredible!

187
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,500
That's really impressive.
Hey.

188
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,650
Wow, that's amazing!
Hey.

189
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,190
Huh?
There's some over here too!

190
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,751
Wow, that's amazing, really impressive!

191
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,179
We can buy the souvenirs later, right?

192
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah.

193
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,980
Do you want to go in and take a look?

194
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Just for a moment.

195
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Yeah.

196
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,500
Wow!

197
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
So white!

198
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,970
It's so soft and fluffy!

199
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,600
Wow!

200
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Aren't you going to buy it?

201
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,480
It's okay, really, you don't have to.

202
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,800
Tojo-san really can't bring
himself to spend money on himself.

203
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,199
Ah! Tojo-san!

204
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Huh?

205
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,409
This is the one I won
from the arcade before.

206
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,089
Ah! Are they from the same series?

207
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, I didn't realize there
were so many different kinds.

208
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,700
At the time, I grabbed it because I thought
this guy really looked like Tojo-san.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,600
So strong!

210
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,000
That's amazing!

211
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
That's amazing!

212
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,000
Wow! You really got it with just one coin!

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,599
That was amazing, but
honestly, it was a little boring too.

214
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Shut up!

215
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Tojo-san.

216
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Here you go.

217
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,799
Huh, for me?!

218
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,300
Because it's a sparrow.

219
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,000
As I thought, for me...

220
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
This one is the cutest.

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
I'll just buy one to take home.

222
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,100
So... how about this one with glasses?

223
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Feels a lot like me.

224
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,500
What kind of reason is that?

225
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll buy it.

226
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,300
No... no need, it's okay!

227
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
I want to do this.

228
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,500
As a memento of today.

229
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I'm counting on you.

230
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Thank you.

231
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,630
Wow, it really is so smooth and silky!

232
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,200
Is this your first time trying it?

233
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,300
I've always wanted to try it.

234
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
For real?

235
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
This trend has been around for a while now.

236
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,000
It does feel a bit weird for
an old man to go buy it.

237
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,600
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

238
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,320
If you like something, just like it.
There's nothing wrong with that.

239
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Let me have a sip.

240
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,580
Mm! So sweet!

241
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,200
Kazama is really strong!

242
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
It feels great to have plans lined up.

243
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
What?

244
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,080
After all, isn't this week super busy?

245
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah.

246
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,900
But just thinking about having
plans for the weekend makes me feel.

247
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,300
Alright, I'm going to hang in there!

248
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Thanks!

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I had an amazing time today.

250
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,020
It's okay even if it's just on a whim.

251
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,489
This rain is just insane!

252
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,849
Tojo-san, there's a spot over there
where we can take shelter from the rain!

253
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,400
Over there?
Yeah.

254
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
It's coming down so hard...

255
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
All soaked...

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Here, this is for you.

257
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,260
Wipe yourself off quickly.
Ah! Sorry about that.

258
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:32,291
It's the first time I've seen
him without his glasses.

259
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,500
Tojo-san, you're soaked too, aren't you?

260
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,320
No, I'm really fine.

261
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Is that so?

262
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
I can't see very clearly.

263
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,420
Is your eyesight really that bad?

264
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Yeah.

265
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,939
Once I take off my
glasses, I can't see a thing.

266
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,900
That's actually why I
gave up on volleyball, too…

267
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,800
Ah! I see it now.

268
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Hey, Tojo-san.

269
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm not just acting on a whim.

270
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Your hair is all wet.

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I hope you can value
yourself a little more.

272
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,500
Ah! Why is this rain still not letting up?

273
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Kiss.

274
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,300
I thought he was going to kiss me.

275
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,800
Starting today, you two will...

276
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
Time to move!

277
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
There's still more on the list.

278
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
Seven things.

279
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
I'm really looking forward to
what's next, Suzume-chan.

280
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,300
What should I do with him next time?

281
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,549
(Next Episode Preview)
Let's make an amazing custom meal!

282
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,299
- He was a senior from the volleyball club back in college.
- It's been a long time.

283
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,099
Consistently putting in the effort
every day really makes a difference.

284
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,990
No matter how hard I
try now, it's pointless.

285
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,700
If there's something you can't do alone,
just do it together with someone else.
