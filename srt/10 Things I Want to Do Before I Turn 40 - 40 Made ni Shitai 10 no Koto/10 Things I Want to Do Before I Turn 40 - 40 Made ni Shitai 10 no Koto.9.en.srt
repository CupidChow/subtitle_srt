1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,440
Oh no.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,060
I fell asleep.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,930
Ugh... Ah...

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,770
I'm done for... Did I screw up?

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,240
I told you so, Suzume-chan!

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,130
Morning.

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,650
How are you feeling?

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:40,980
Ugh...

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,030
Yep, I have a fever.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay...

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm used to handling a fever by now.

12
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,100
Step one.

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,110
Take the cold medicine I have on hand.

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,730
I can buy more later.

15
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,030
This kind of thing happens.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,220
Step two.

17
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,510
Reschedule my meetings.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,990
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience...

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,160
I'd like to reschedule...

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,170
Step three.

21
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,680
Call in sick to work.

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,020
Calling too early or too late is a no-go.

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,910
Hello?

24
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,840
- You have to get the timing just right.
- Um...

25
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,010
Actually...

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,600
when I woke up today,

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,430
I found I had a bit of a fever.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,090
It's a little over 37 degrees.

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,520
- It's not that high...
- It's important not to make everyone worry for no reason.

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,060
All right, everyone.

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,210
Tojo-san called in sick with a cold today.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,650
Huh? A cold?

33
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,590
Probably from the fatigue of his business trip.

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,070
Huh? You think so?

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,360
Is he okay?

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,340
But Tojo-san lives alone...

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,850
Well...

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
someone's probably looking after him, right?

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,680
Then it shouldn't be a problem.

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,670
But isn't it hard being sick all by yourself?

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 9)

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,090
Step four.

43
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,830
Buy what I need
before I'm too sick to move.

44
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,100
Welcome.
Thanks.

45
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,760
Do you need a bag...?

46
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,560
Yes, please.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,030
Okay.

48
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,110
Yeah.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm single, after all.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,690
There's no one to buy this stuff for me.

51
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,330
No, thank you.

52
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,870
- Sorry to trouble you.
- Thank you.

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,210
Take care, now.

54
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,590
Keep your chin up.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,060
Tomorrow will be a better day.

56
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay?

57
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,170
Bad times don't last forever.

58
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,760
Get a good night's sleep.

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Please come again.

60
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm used to the pity.

61
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,790
Step five.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,350
All right.

63
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,510
Time for sleep.

64
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,790
Time to crash.

65
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,960
Just lie down and sleep it off.

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,920
Tojo-san.

67
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,560
Tojo-san.

68
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,270
Hurry...

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,890
Keishi.

70
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,100
Seriously...

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,920
What are you doing?

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,620
He seems to be...

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,240
- saying something.
- Look.

74
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,600
Hurry...

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,760
Keishi.
Tojo-san.

76
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,190
Suzume-san.

77
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,910
Weekend Dad.

78
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,530
Weekend Dad?

79
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,160
What is that outfit?

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,000
Isn't that the weekend bear?

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,910
But I kept it so well hidden~!

82
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,410
Mmm.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,570
Oh, good.

84
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,190
It was just a dream...

85
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm drenched in sweat.

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,350
Ugh...

87
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,330
Final stage symptoms. One:

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,770
You start having nightmares.

89
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm hungry.

90
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,090
Two:

91
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,350
You don't know what you should eat.

92
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,830
Three:

93
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,210
You start wishing someone would come and help.

94
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,560
But...

95
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,710
I'm used to this, too.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,970
I guess I'll make some congee.

97
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,130
Getting my appetite back means...

98
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,900
the battle with the high fever is finally coming to an end.

99
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:29,710
Huh?

100
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,220
Keishi?

101
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,420
Yes.

102
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,100
Suzume-san.

103
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,110
It's Keishi. Are you okay?

104
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,740
Huh? Uh... yeah.

105
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,630
Why are you here?

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,190
What do you mean, "why"?

107
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,850
I came to check on you.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,470
No, you can't come in. You'll catch it.

109
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,050
It's fine. I always carry hand sanitizer.

110
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,970
I don't want to get you sick.

111
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,940
I have a super strong immune system.

112
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,680
No...
But...

113
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,740
I was worried. At least let me see your face.

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,800
What's this?

115
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,180
What are you talking about?

116
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,310
It's congee.

117
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,670
Were you going to make this for me?

118
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,080
You even went out to buy rice.

119
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,630
Can't make congee without rice.

120
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,350
I didn't expect you to be toughing it out all by yourself.

121
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,220
I...

122
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,980
I'm the one who's sick, and I'm getting lectured.

123
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,990
I said no. Stay away from me.

124
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,880
How's your fever?

125
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,570
It's fine now.

126
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,930
You're still a bit warm.

127
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,570
You must have been burning up.

128
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,960
I took some cold medicine right away. I'm fine.

129
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,850
Why do you always insist on handling everything yourself?

130
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,080
Because I'm used to being on my own.

131
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,580
That's not something you should get used to.

132
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,980
Times like these...

133
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,910
are when you're supposed to rely on people.

134
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,670
I'll put these...

135
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,860
in the fridge for now.

136
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,410
Um...

137
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,060
What is it?

138
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,440
The apple...

139
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,300
Could you grate it for me later?

140
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,270
I'd really appreciate it.

141
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,460
Of course.

142
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,300
Stop staring at me.

143
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,480
You're the one who told me to stay away.

144
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,700
You don't have to watch me like a hawk.

145
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,860
I'll eat this and go straight to bed.

146
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,260
Cute.

147
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,940
Ah!

148
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,080
Wait, you're still wearing this?

149
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,840
No...

150
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,160
It's not what it looks like. I mean...

151
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,150
I didn't wear them.

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,050
You don't have to hide things like that.

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,250
Suzume-san.

154
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,550
You're always like this,
hiding things and trying to act tough.

155
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,450
I'm not trying to be tough.

156
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,600
When you're always on your own,

157
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,040
you just naturally learn to handle things yourself.

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,520
But this...

159
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,970
This isn't something you can handle alone, is it?

160
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,930
I'll stay by your side until you fall asleep.

161
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,170
There's still...

162
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,770
four left.

163
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,030
When you get over your cold,

164
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,070
let's go get parfaits.

165
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
That sounds nice.

166
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,580
Going to sleep now?

167
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,870
Yeah.

168
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,360
Ah, I feel so much better.

169
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,810
My fever's gone too.

170
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,350
A rabbit.

171
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,370
Oh.

173
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,950
It's really coming down, isn't it?

174
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,410
But it's okay.

175
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,950
As long as I'm with you...

176
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm happy.

177
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,600
Finally...

178
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,110
It's time for parfaits.

179
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
It is.

180
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,210
For some reason, seeing the rain...

181
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,010
makes me think of that marine park. Don't you think?

182
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,170
- It was pouring that day, too.
- Yeah, it was.

183
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
But...

184
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,210
that was fun, too.

185
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,830
Huh?
Which one?

186
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,190
Let's go.

187
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,650
Okay.

188
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,730
Keishi?

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,510
Oh, Tojo-san! You're here too.

190
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,420
Tanaka.

191
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,290
What a coincidence.

192
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,660
So, anyway,

193
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
what are you two doing here today?

194
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,770
Oh, nothing.

195
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
We just happened to run into each other. Right?

196
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,730
Right.

197
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,860
Tanaka-san?

198
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,430
Are you out shopping?

199
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,250
No.

200
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,840
I'm here scouting a location for a project.

201
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,000
That's so you. Working even on the weekend.

202
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,920
I was just about to buy some clothes.

203
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,530
I see.

204
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,750
What about you, Keishi?

205
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,460
Are you on your way to a date?

206
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,760
Well...

207
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,150
Something like that.

208
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,810
Tanaka-san?

209
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,980
Ah!

210
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,150
So that's what this is.

211
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,960
You two are dating.

212
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,200
No, the thing is...

213
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,530
My intuition is pretty good when it comes to this stuff.

214
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,520
No.

215
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,150
At the get-together the other day,

216
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,250
I heard Keishi call you "Suzume-san"...
and thought it was strange.

217
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,850
But now it all makes perfect sense.

218
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,070
But don't worry.

219
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,010
I have no prejudice about that kind of thing.

220
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,110
And I won't tell a soul.

221
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,690
Oh, Keishi.

222
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,120
You could've just told me.

223
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,890
Ah, but then again...

224
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,860
I guess it's not something you can just come out and say.

225
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,480
Even so, you didn't have to lie to me.

226
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,520
Tanaka-san.

227
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,850
Your imagination is getting the better of you.

228
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,720
What is going on here?

229
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,070
No, that's not...

230
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,100
You two aren't dating...?

231
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

232
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,810
Huh? But...

233
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,800
Didn't you call him "Suzume-san"?

234
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,030
No, I didn't.

235
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,700
What?

236
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,050
So then...

237
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,120
- You're dating, then?
- Of course not.

238
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,370
Absolutely not.

239
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,570
Besides,

240
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,010
even if I were gay,

241
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
it wouldn't be with Tojo-san.

242
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,190
How cruel.

243
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,310
But he has a point.

244
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,600
Dating your boss? Yeah, right.

245
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,340
Right?

246
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,470
Tojo-san.

247
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,290
Yeah, yeah.

248
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,560
Ah, sorry.

249
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,700
I just zoned out for a moment.

250
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,280
You have a very active imagination.
Put it to use at work.

251
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,810
- Roger that.
- Mm.

252
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,090
And one more thing.

253
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,230
While I have the chance,

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,040
I want to ask you to do something for me.

255
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes?

256
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,830
All this talk about marriage,
finding someone, dating apps, and all that...

257
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,480
Just drop it.

258
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,180
It's my private life, after all.

259
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,140
I honestly have...

260
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,250
absolutely no interest in marriage or romance.

261
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,990
So...

262
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,930
Understand?

263
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes.

264
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,170
I... I just prefer being alone.

265
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,760
Well, I'm off.

266
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,200
Keishi.

267
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,240
I feel awful about what happened.

268
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,520
I think I really got the wrong idea.

269
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,420
Tanaka-san.

270
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,370
You know how people say they aren't prejudiced?

271
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,450
Don't you think they're often the most prejudiced of all?

272
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,000
(Incoming Call: Keishi Tanaka)

273
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,800
(Missed Call)
(Where are you? Please pick up. Please!)

274
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,180
What have I done to my subordinate?

275
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,410
I...

276
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,890
Suzume-san?

277
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,230
Suzume-san, where are you now?

278
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,730
I'm home.

279
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,510
Sorry, I...

280
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,490
I panicked because I thought we'd be found out,
so I said those horrible things.

281
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,400
I was shocked too. It was all so sudden.

282
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,510
I wasn't thinking straight.

283
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,920
I didn't mean a word of it.

284
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,480
I know.

285
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,950
I also...

286
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,530
didn't expect to be exposed like that.

287
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,350
I'm so sorry I couldn't help you cover for us.

288
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,430
No.

289
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,950
It was all my fault.

290
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,560
Um...

291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,800
Are you okay?

292
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,140
Yeah.

293
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,800
Then let's just see each other at work as usual.

294
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,380
But...

295
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,420
let's not meet up on weekends for a while.

296
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,960
Okay.

297
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,680
What am I supposed to do?

298
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,120
Tell me...

299
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,560
Suzuko...

300
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,380
(Next Episode)
- Let's showtime! - Hello.

301
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,440
Just being in love,

302
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,060
just wanting to be together...

303
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,500
I've realized that's just not enough.

304
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,870
Suzume-san.

305
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Let's not see each other outside of work anymore.
