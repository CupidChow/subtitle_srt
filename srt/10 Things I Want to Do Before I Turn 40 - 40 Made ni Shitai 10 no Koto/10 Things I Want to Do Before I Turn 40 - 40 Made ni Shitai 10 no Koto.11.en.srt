1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,780
Good morning.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,850
Good morning.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,390
Good morning.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,440
Good morning.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,490
- Morning.
- Morning.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,810
Tojo-san has been coming in pretty late
every day this week.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,010
He was just coming in too early before.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,750
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,110
I guess... it must be my fault.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,000
I...

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,340
I don't even know who I am anymore.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,810
So...

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's not see each other outside of work anymore.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,160
I can't... take this any further.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,160
Morning.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,450
Morning.

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,620
Morning.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,120
I'm afraid that if things fall apart...

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,620
there'll be no going back.

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,800
Sigh...

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40
(Episode 11)

22
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,720
My girlfriend's been so cold to me.

23
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah?

24
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,480
She said she's too busy to see me on the weekend.

25
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,380
She's definitely avoiding me.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,020
And...

27
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,090
nothing has happened between us yet.

28
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,760
She keeps turning me down.

29
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,880
What should I do?

30
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,570
Why don't you just ask her?

31
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,640
Ask her directly.

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,720
Ask her why she won't do it?

33
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,820
Yeah.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,350
If I had the guts to ask, I would have already.

35
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,040
She probably feels the same way.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,280
"If I had the guts to say it, I would have already."

37
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,380
Maybe.

38
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,860
If I'm direct with her and she runs off...

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,060
then you'll just have to give up.

40
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,280
You could at least try to encourage me a little.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm not in the mood.

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,190
You're not...

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,920
still mad, are you?

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,240
Huh?

45
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,930
When I saw you with Tojo-san,

46
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,200
I just assumed you two were dating.

47
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,710
Back then...

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,460
you seemed really mad.

49
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,500
What do you mean, "seemed"?

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,650
You really don't know why?

51
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,800
I know I messed up.

52
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,690
That's not good enough.

53
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,880
Apologizing without even knowing the reason.

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,380
Oh.

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,600
Uh...

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,110
When you've actually figured out why...

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,170
come and tell me then.

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Okay.

60
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,220
Want some of this?

61
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,460
It's good.

62
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,480
Alright, I'll leave the rest to you.

63
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,330
Thanks.
Okay.

64
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,350
I'll be in touch by next week.

65
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,370
Thank you.

66
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,670
And say hi to Tojo-san for me.

67
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,420
Will do.

68
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,780
Ah.

69
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,950
Keishi, are you busy on Saturday?

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Uh, I don't have anything scheduled for work.

71
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,340
How about we play squash then?

72
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,320
Uh...

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,790
Back when I was in Osaka,

74
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,420
didn't you used to play
with the guys from the volleyball club?

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,530
Not really...

76
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,470
But I haven't gone recently.

77
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,170
Tsukahara and Teramoto said they're coming too.

78
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,620
Oh.

79
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,840
So? What do you say?

80
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,770
Yeah...

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,910
I'd like to go.

82
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,220
Okay, I'll hit you up later.

83
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,470
I can't say yes right away.

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

85
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,520
It seems I still...

86
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,450
can't give up on the idea...

87
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,650
of spending the weekend with Suzume-san.

88
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,510
I don't feel like doing anything.

89
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,190
It's been a while...

90
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,170
since I've had a weekend with no plans.

91
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,860
I'm so bored.

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,690
Suzuko.

93
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,790
Ever since then...

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,050
I haven't heard Suzuko's voice.

95
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,770
Come to think of it...

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,310
when I'm alone...

97
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,600
what do I usually do?

98
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,070
I'm hungry.

99
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,600
Ouch... ah!

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,110
I haven't moved in so long, my body's so stiff.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,840
You say that...

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,670
but didn't you work out a lot in Osaka too?

103
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
I'm definitely not going easy on you.

104
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,320
You've always been like this.

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,270
Don't get all serious on me.

106
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,300
No, but...

107
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,410
It's great that Keishi could make it.
It's been a while.

108
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,730
Yeah.
Mmm.

109
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,830
Reuniting at a client's office.

110
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,420
You two are really fated.

111
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,590
Indeed.

112
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,130
You were always inseparable back in school...

113
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,440
We just clicked.

114
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,580
Right, Keishi?
Right.

115
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,500
It's surprising you didn't see each other again
after graduation.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,160
No, that's because after Sakuma started dating the manager,

117
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,710
he started ignoring Keishi, didn't he?

118
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,540
Hey, Keishi.
You must have been lonely.

119
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm not a kid.

120
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,320
No, that's not it...

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,600
Someone as popular as you...

122
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,130
probably doesn't get lonely.

123
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,660
What kind of thing is that to say?

124
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,290
So dirty...

125
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,290
Let's get a new one.

126
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,460
Buying a whole machine for something
you'll only use once.

127
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,240
Huh? It's the exact opposite.

128
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,730
Once you buy it...

129
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,380
you can use it as many times as you want.

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,350
But we still only used it once.

131
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,230
Speaking of which...

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,820
Oh...

133
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,050
Should we just use this to make something?

134
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,870
Oh, good idea.

135
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,490
But shouldn't we put it in right away?

136
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,510
- Okay.
- Keishi, squat down a bit more, you're out of the frame!

137
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,900
My bad.
Sorry, sorry.

138
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,030
Okay, let's take one.

139
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,810
Okay, smile!

140
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,700
- Oh, this looks great.
- Send me the photo.

141
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,050
AirDrop it to me.

142
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,940
Whoa!

143
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,060
Nice shot!

144
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,490
Are you holding this?
- Got it.
- Okay.

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,790
What is this?

146
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,320
Mmm.

147
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,760
Mmm.

148
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,520
Delicious.

149
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,520
Mmm.

150
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,890
Mmm.

151
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,150
It's hot, isn't it?

152
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,110
I thought I was used to being alone.

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,210
It's good.

154
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,650
Delicious.

155
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,400
About what we were talking about earlier...

156
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
Did you notice I was avoiding you?

157
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,660
I guess it couldn't be helped.

158
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,610
But I regret it...

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,790
I really do.

160
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,040
I regret how I acted back then.

161
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,050
Even if I couldn't return your feelings...

162
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,010
I should have faced you properly.

163
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,200
I shouldn't have run away.

164
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,790
I was the one who ran away.

165
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,620
Because I didn't want to get hurt.

166
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,220
I was the one who chose to avoid it.

167
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,440
So I guess that makes us even.

168
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,710
Hiyah!

169
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,050
Talking about these old stories...

170
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,570
really shows how old we've gotten.

171
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,120
You're right.

172
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,440
We're such old guys now.

173
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,780
Sakuma.

174
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,040
If you're on a break, want to join us?

175
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,220
Oh.

176
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,650
Sure, let's play.

177
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,800
Take care, senpai.

178
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,050
I'm off.

179
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,680
Bring it on.

180
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,040
You sure pick the weirdest times to call.

181
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,390
Regret...

182
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,860
Tanaka-san?

183
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,860
Yes.

184
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,130
I broke up with her.

185
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,360
Did you have a proper talk with her?

186
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,450
I did.

187
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,390
It was the only thing to do.

188
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,010
You did?

189
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,550
Yeah.

190
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,840
The truth is...

192
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,310
I'm actually into girls.

193
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,910
She said she's into girls.

194
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,940
But...

195
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,170
If that's the case...

196
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,030
Then why did she go out with me?

197
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,540
Why say she liked me?

198
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,740
Why did she even kiss me?

199
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,020
I just don't get it at all.

200
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,910
But then,

201
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,990
while I was so confused,

202
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,860
it finally dawned on me.

203
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,560
I don't really understand anything at all.

204
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,390
Keishi.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,150
The other day,

206
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,940
I acted like I knew everything.

207
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm really sorry.

208
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,120
Well then,

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,880
I guess I can forgive you.

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,530
Thank you.

211
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,520
It was a huge blow,

212
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,260
but...

213
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,570
I think I can

214
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,570
move on without any hard feelings.

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,570
Tanaka-san.

216
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,470
You really gave it your all.

217
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,330
No, I didn't.
Don't say that.

218
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,900
No, for you to say that...

219
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,640
to my face...

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,100
(Sakuma: Playing squash with my old college volleyball friends.)

221
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,370
This is fine...

222
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,440
Hello?

223
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,190
The cake from the department store food court...

224
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,480
I bought it.

225
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,220
Why?

226
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,150
The list...

227
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,090
It's not finished yet, is it?

228
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,410
I want to talk to you properly.

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,930
That's all.

230
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,150
I...

231
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,030
don't want to have any more regrets.

232
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,840
This is the first time I've fallen for someone
I could imagine a future with.

233
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,880
So,

234
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,600
I don't want anyone to ruin it.

235
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,860
I was so happy when I was with you.

236
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,050
Things like age or our positions...

237
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,870
I forgot all about them.

238
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,800
I got carried away.

239
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,660
Isn't that a good thing?

240
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,850
No, it's not!

241
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,200
If things continue like this,

242
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,250
everything you've worked so hard to build...

243
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,300
will be destroyed by me.

244
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,860
That's why I can't do this.

245
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,220
- I don't mind!
- I...

246
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,690
I'm the one who can't do it.

247
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,080
I...

248
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,280
can't handle things as gracefully as you do.

249
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,560
I can't get past it.

250
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,070
I don't have the resolve to carry the weight of your future.

251
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,780
Resolve...

252
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,180
What resolve...?

253
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,310
What are you talking about, resolve?

254
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,490
I don't need any resolve!

255
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,000
I just want to be with you, Suzume-san.

256
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,500
Let's end it here.

257
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,830
Suzume... Suzume-san!

258
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,550
Why...

259
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,810
Why do you always have to decide things on your own?

260
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,770
Is it because you're older?

261
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,870
Or because you're my boss?

262
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,730
What about the list?

263
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,300
What's going to happen to the list?

264
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,300
We were so close to finishing it.

265
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,910
Just forget about it.

266
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,000
The cake...

267
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,750
Make sure you eat it.

268
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,020
Your place isn't here.

269
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,780
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,510
(Next time on...)
Even though you were ready to get serious, I...

271
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,170
Please don't run away.

272
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,450
I want you, Suzume,

273
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,050
to be happy.

274
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,410
I'm always selfishly...

275
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,510
thinking things like that.

276
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,330
I am happy.
