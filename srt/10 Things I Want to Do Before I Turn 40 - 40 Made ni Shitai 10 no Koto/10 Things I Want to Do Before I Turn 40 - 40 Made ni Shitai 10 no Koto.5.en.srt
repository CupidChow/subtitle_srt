1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,880
Ah! It broke!

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,720
Ever since I started the list.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,880
My weekends have changed.

4
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,270
I used to always sleep in until noon.

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,710
And then just spend the day lazing around…

6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,870
(Shop for clothes)
Because I'm really looking forward to going out with Keishi,

7
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,070
I end up waking up early without even realizing it.

8
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,190
That's great!

9
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,180
I have more friends now.

10
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,100
Well then...

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,600
What do you think about the one with glasses?

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,940
Feels a lot like me.

13
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,020
What kind of reason is that?

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,890
It was the same back then, too.

15
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,390
I also picked this guy because he really reminds me of Tojo-san.

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,820
As I thought, for me.

17
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,970
This one is the cutest.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,420
Now, for me,

19
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,550
I only want you, Tojo-san.

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,240
That guy...

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,920
When did he start having feelings for me...?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,500
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"
(Episode 5)

23
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,200
(Fashion style change)

24
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,430
Huh?
A suit?

25
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,980
Um...

26
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,920
Why are you wearing a suit?

27
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,900
No...

28
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,570
Because you said I looked like a dad on vacation last time.

29
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,980
Oh, is that so?

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,170
Huh?

31
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,250
So that's why you're wearing a suit?

32
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,340
You're so noisy!

33
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,980
These are the only clothes I have to wear!

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,160
That's hilarious.

35
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,400
We're buying new clothes today, isn't that good enough?

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,340
It's great that we added it to the list.

37
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,170
Hmm...

38
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,790
Huh?

39
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,320
Didn't you say you wanted to change up your style?

40
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,350
Hmm...

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,600
The store is just around the corner up ahead.

42
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,010
No, I mean...

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,470
Clothing stores, you know...

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,690
It can be really stressful.

45
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,270
Stressful?

46
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,860
Are you talking about the store clerks?

47
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,660
It's really uncomfortable when someone keeps staring at you.

48
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,810
But on the contrary, if they just gave me a glance
and then completely ignore me, that's awkward too.

49
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,230
You and your double standards.

50
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,650
And then, in the middle of picking things out,
all my excitement just fizzled out.

51
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,180
Since I've got no special date or anything,
why should I dressed up like this?

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,660
Who am I supposed to be showing this off to?

53
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,250
I'll take a look.

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,020
So wear it when you see me.

55
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,330
Yeah.

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,870
Are you nervous?
Yeah!

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,920
Tojo-san, we've been waiting for you for so long~

58
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,390
Thank you for looking after our Keishi.

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,510
Hey, Keishi!

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,090
Keishi, who are they...?

61
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,680
They are my older twin sisters.

62
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm the big sister, Lio.

63
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,410
I look like our dad.

64
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,740
I'm Mao.

65
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,970
I look like our mom.

66
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,460
Keishi has always done things his own way.

67
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,180
Keishi has always been like this, even since way back.

68
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,910
So noisy.

69
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,540
Huh?

70
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,690
It's nothing.

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,100
Even though we're twins, the only thing
that's actually a little similar is the shape of our noses.

72
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,400
We're fraternal twins, and our fashion styles are totally opposite, too.

73
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
This is one of our shop's strengths, too.

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,270
We can handle any type of customers.

75
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,240
Don't worry about them, I'll talk to them for you.

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Tojo-san.

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,330
What kind of clothes do you usually wear?

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,480
You probably came straight here after work today, right?

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,430
Ah...

80
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
No...

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,070
He dressed like this because he didn't know what else to wear.

82
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,160
I see.

83
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,480
The fabric of this suit is really nice.
It shows you have good taste.

84
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,010
But the shirt style could actually
be a bit bolder and livelier, don't you think?

85
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,790
- Do you have a style you like?
- Style...

86
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,550
Like, is there a certain type of actor image you want to go for?

87
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,150
- An actor...?
- Yeah!

88
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,570
Rion, Mao, stop intimidating people with your presence!

89
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,650
That's enough, we can just pick for ourselves, okay?

90
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,080
Right?

91
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,700
The reason I put it on the list is because...

92
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,330
I want to change myself.

93
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,060
Tojo-san?

94
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,780
But...

95
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,060
Right now...

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,190
Thank you, Keishi.

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,270
But...

98
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
with your sisters here,

99
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,160
I should be fine.

100
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,450
Keishi, why don't you go grab a cup of tea or something nearby for now?

101
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,000
Huh?

102
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,440
But still...

103
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,810
I always feel bad for making you keep me company.

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,210
You heard him, Keishi.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
That's how it is.

106
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,660
Then please have a seat.

107
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,270
Alright.

108
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,720
Take your time discussing things with us, it's totally fine.

109
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,520
Sorry.

110
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,010
I'm not very familiar with this.

111
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,580
No problem at all!

112
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,450
I'm looking for clothes to wear on the weekend,

113
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,770
for me to dress up a little.

114
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,400
Clothes that I can wear when going out.

115
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,090
I just want that kind of outfit.

116
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,230
For example,

117
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,550
like for a date or something?

118
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,380
Ah!

119
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,700
Pretty much.

120
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,510
Oh wow, that's awesome!

121
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,370
No...
Sorry.

122
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,270
No need to be shy!

123
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,470
Isn't that a great thing?

124
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,820
Please tell us more about yourself, Tojo-san.

125
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,710
Picking out clothes is also a journey of self-discovery.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,460
That's right.

127
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,840
Let's enjoy this journey together with you.

128
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,620
Alright.

129
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,510
Before...

130
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,730
Tojo-san is always like that.

131
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,500
Just when I thought we'd finally gotten closer,

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,830
he suddenly felt distant again.

133
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,650
He's very capable at work.

134
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,310
He's kind to everyone,

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,560
well-liked by everyone,

136
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,680
and is always surrounded by a crowd of people.

137
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,630
But...

138
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,100
he drew a line that no one could cross.

139
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,180
That line...

140
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,540
Listen to me.

141
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,910
That girl.

142
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,190
She's definitely into Tojo-san.

143
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,050
Really.

144
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,290
Which girl?

145
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,610
It's that temp girl with the big boobs.

146
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,910
- Really?
- I see.

147
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,470
That's just a tiny, insignificant flaw.

148
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,020
No, no, no, but Tojo-san probably noticed too.

149
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,890
No, even if I did notice...

150
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,210
- This person probably...
- Go ahead and eat.

151
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,050
is just like me...

152
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,770
What's it really like?

153
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,070
That's why.

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,720
He likes men just like I do.

155
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
Hurry up and eat!

156
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,270
Even so.

157
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,090
It doesn't mean anything will change.

158
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,100
See? It really suits you!

159
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,870
I hate to say this, but it really does suit you.

160
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
What do you think?

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,620
Can I try on some others?

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Of course!

163
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,300
Well then.
This one.

164
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,300
Try this one on.

165
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,230
This outfit is pretty nice, too.

166
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,050
Not just okay, it looks amazing!

167
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,190
This is my first time wearing something like this.

168
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,260
Then let's try on the next outfit.

169
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,380
Okay.

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh, this one works too!

171
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,400
Right?
But.

172
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,650
Feels like it's a little too youthful.

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,220
No problem.

174
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,330
There are still so many more to try on.

175
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,870
I was always making excuses,

176
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,540
becoming timid.

177
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,770
I was too scared to even take the first step.

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,990
But...

179
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,690
At that moment...
Here it goes!

180
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
my body just moved on its own.

181
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,970
Do you trust me now?

182
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,850
Tojo-san.

183
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,530
You never thought I felt the same way, did you?

184
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,380
Throw it harder!

185
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,850
Sorry.

186
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,470
Celebrate my birthday with my partner.

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,490
Partner?

188
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,470
Tojo-san and I...

189
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,150
we're just in a relationship held together by a list.

190
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,080
That's right.

191
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,030
I really think

192
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,270
all these clothes are great.

193
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,450
But.

194
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,740
I don't really know which one I like the most.

195
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,290
Sorry, it seems like I made things difficult for you.

196
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,530
That's not true.

197
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,590
We had a great time ourselves, too.

198
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,740
We're really happy.

199
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,870
Yeah, this really is the first time!

200
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,500
It's really the first time Keishi has ever brought someone to our shop.

201
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,630
- Right?
- Yeah!

202
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,190
Is that so?

203
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,420
Even though Keishi looks like that on the outside,
he's actually a really pure-hearted kid.

204
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,850
He always acts like he loves to tease everyone,
but deep down he's actually super shy.

205
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,340
He's really not good at expressing his feelings.

206
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,300
It's really frustrating to see him constantly misunderstood.

207
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,750
Ah...

208
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,530
So that's how it is.

209
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,470
About Keishi...

210
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,630
Keishi...

211
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,880
What did he say about me?

212
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,750
Crow.

213
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,970
A crow?

214
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,900
In the park near the office.

215
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,800
He said you were the one
who protected his lunch from the crows.

216
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,790
Ah!

217
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,830
- That really happened!
- Right!

218
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,680
Yes.

219
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,160
Keishi, he...

220
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,050
fell asleep on the bench.

221
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,170
And then the lunchbox was just sitting there,
with the crows eyeing it hungrily.

222
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,020
Oh no, I fell asleep.

223
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,750
Morning!

224
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,160
Huh?

225
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,050
I kept an eye on your lunch for you.

226
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,130
I came here to have my lunch,

227
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,540
turns out your lunch was about to get snatched.

228
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,970
Thank you.

229
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,140
Yeah.

230
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,560
Huh?

231
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Riao, Mao.

232
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,800
(Which outfit is better?)

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,040
(Which outfit is better? Tell me!)

234
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,360
Not yet.

235
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,850
The list isn't finished yet.

236
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,750
This color stands out more than that one, right?

237
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,270
No way! Tojo-san likes that collar style!

238
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,580
No way! If you want to change your image,
you have to go with this one!

239
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,470
No, this one suits Tojo-san's style even better.

240
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,450
This one is really cute!

241
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,150
But didn't you say you wanted a different vibe?
So you should go with this one.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,600
So cute!

243
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,280
Rion, Mao!

244
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,660
I really appreciate how hard you're both trying to help me,
but aren't you getting a little too excited?

245
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,320
No, that's not it...

246
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,990
That's not it, Keishi.

247
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,970
I just can't decide what I actually like.

248
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,220
Tojo-san, do cooler colors make you feel more composed?

249
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,430
Ah...

250
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,820
Exactly.

251
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,540
And also,

252
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,900
comfortability matters.

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,540
The texture of the fabric is really important.

254
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,460
Right?

255
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,290
Hmm...

256
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,370
Definitely.

257
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,990
I don't really like scratchy textures,
or fabrics that feel cold.

258
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,690
Yeah.

259
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,000
What do you think?

260
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,420
I absolutely love it.

261
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,210
Yeah.

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,400
Then it's better to go with something stretchy.

263
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,760
How about this one?

264
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
This really helped a lot.

265
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,070
Yeah.

266
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,030
That way, it can also go with the clothes Tojo-san already has.

267
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,710
The size should be just right, too.

268
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,090
Well then...

269
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,840
Yeah.

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,190
It really suits you.

271
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,290
You...

272
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,030
You really have been paying attention to me all this time!

273
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,190
So?

274
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,540
Do you find it annoying?

275
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,530
No.

276
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,650
Maybe that's not a bad idea.

277
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,320
Yeah.

278
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,390
It looks great.

279
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,010
Have you made up your mind?

280
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,460
I'll go with this one.

281
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,710
It really suits you.

282
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,820
Thank you.

283
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,130
This one.

284
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,200
Can I try it on?

285
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,420
Of course, no problem.

286
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,240
You're always welcome to come back anytime.

287
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,110
Alright.

288
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,240
I'll come visit again.

289
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,320
Keishi, you too.

290
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,370
You should drop by the shop
and show your face once in a while.

291
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,650
Got it!

292
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,890
Alright, we're heading out.

293
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,800
Thank you so much.

294
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,620
Thanks!

295
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,930
It's really great to meet good people.

296
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah.

297
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,050
Didn't we do pretty well today?

298
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,500
Let's clean up.

299
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,420
Let's clean up.

300
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,150
- Keishi.
- Tojo-san.

301
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,750
Keishi, you go first.

302
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,080
No, Tojo-san, why don't you go first?

303
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,630
That thing with the crow.

304
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,030
I remember now.

305
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,470
Huh?

306
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,090
Did my sisters tell you that?

307
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,760
I'm surprised you still remember something so trivial.

308
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,010
To me, that was really special.

309
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,690
Yeah.

310
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,070
And that other thing.

311
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,620
Last spring.

312
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,030
Huh?

313
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,120
I gave Tojo-san the sparrow plushie
you won from the claw machine.

314
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,630
Has it really been that long?

315
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,690
Yes.

316
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,970
On the way back.

317
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,970
You put it in your pocket.

318
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,650
Huh?

319
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,270
Here you go.

320
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,270
This one is the cutest.

321
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,020
Thank you.

322
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,960
Getting something like this
makes you wonder, “What is this for?” Right?

323
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,830
Please don't throw it away, okay?

324
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,260
I would never throw it away.

325
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,640
Take a look at this.

326
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,870
- Exactly the same.
- It really is the same.

327
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,990
Even the eyebrows are the same.

328
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,500
- Exactly the same.
- Seriously.

329
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,630
Keishi definitely knows everything.

330
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,370
Like, where to aim so it'll just drop right there.
He knows too well.

331
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,800
He only does it when he's got it under control.

332
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,070
Thanks!

333
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,000
Alright, let's go.

334
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,820
Okay.

335
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,960
I've always been watching you!

336
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,380
So it was from way back then...

337
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,160
he started paying attention to me.

338
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,570
So...

339
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,050
Please don't be so polite anymore.

340
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,650
Speaking of which,

341
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,060
you should've just picked out clothes with me from the start.

342
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,920
Sorry.

343
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,980
But it's okay.

344
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,140
It's not like that.

345
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,430
It's not because I'm just being polite…

346
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,790
It's...

347
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,750
because I'm with Keishi.

348
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,770
That's why I wanted to change.

349
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,040
Okay.

350
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,190
Um...

351
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,860
Before...

352
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,900
There was someone I cared about before.

353
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,310
He said my outfit makes me look like a dad on the weekend.

354
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,880
That's not even someone you need to care about.

355
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,640
Yeah, even though I don't really know
what kind of person they are.

356
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,430
No.
But

357
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,680
that's not what I meant.
Huh?

358
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,400
I hope I can become someone worthy of that person.

359
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,250
So when I'm with that person...

360
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,980
I won't be ashamed of myself.

361
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,750
I want to become that kind of person.

362
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,320
So that's why you want to do it alone...

363
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,260
So.

364
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,490
That's why I wanted to do it alone…

365
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,030
I'm really, really happy.

366
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,220
Do you want to grab a meal together?

367
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,870
As a thank you for today.

368
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,640
That's great!

369
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,810
Then I'll just come clean about that thing too.

370
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,570
What? There's more?

371
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,270
This.

372
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,020
I sent this to my sisters.

373
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,500
Huh?

374
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,800
I told them that even though
you're kind of like a weekend dad,

375
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,340
I'll still be counting on their help.

376
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,150
So then...

377
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,880
they already knew?

378
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,590
Yes.

379
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,760
- If your sisters find out...
- What do you want to eat?

380
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,040
(Next Episode)
We can do it just the two of us.

381
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,780
If we can rally back and forth 20 times,

382
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,660
let's go to the department store food court
and buy some cakes as a reward.

383
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,450
Come here.

384
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,230
That's not what I meant…

385
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,350
I was only planning to have some cake.

386
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,820
Don't say something so mean.
