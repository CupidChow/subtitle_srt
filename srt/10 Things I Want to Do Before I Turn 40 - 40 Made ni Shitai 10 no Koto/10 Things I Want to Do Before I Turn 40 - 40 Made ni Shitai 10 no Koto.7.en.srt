(Performance Review)

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,950
You landed four new projects together
with the sales department.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,700
Mm-hm.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,410
While still handling your ongoing projects...

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,900
that's a very impressive number. You've worked hard.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,460
Thank you.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,440
But I'm a little concerned about your workload
increasing. How are you managing?

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,320
It's not a problem for now.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,000
If it becomes too much, I'll let you know.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,680
Good.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,250
I'll be sure to check in with you.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,930
Okay.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,200
Thank you.

14
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,060
Also...

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,780
- Keishi, you've been in this department for three years now.
- Yes.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,500
Have you thought about returning to sales...

17
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,720
or trying out another department?

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,520
Be honest. Has the thought crossed your mind?

19
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,640
For now...

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,450
I want to continue giving my all to the marketing department.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,590
Come over.

22
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,330
There's still so much more I want to learn here.

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,040
I see.

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,480
That's a relief to hear.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,110
- Okay, next...
- Yes.

26
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,980
In terms of teamwork...

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,040
I think you're collaborating very well.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,820
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,570
Thank you very much.

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,190
Excuse me.

31
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,210
My face.

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,990
Was I making a weird face...?

33
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,080
Suzume Tojo.

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,570
Age 39.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,190
The other day...

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,260
my subordinate kissed me on the forehead.

37
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,550
Thinking about that during a performance review...
I'm such an unprofessional employee.

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,340
But...

39
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,830
is this what an office romance feels like?

40
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know how people do it.

41
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,600
An office romance.

42
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,070
Keeping it secret.

43
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,710
No, no, no, you'd keep it secret even if it were serious.

44
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,030
Ah.

45
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,510
But he could just be playing around.

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,120
I don't know.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,350
Excuse me.

48
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,910
Tojo-san.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,370
Tojo-san?

50
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,360
Shall we begin?

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,300
Huh?
What is it?

52
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,980
- Huh?
- Huh?

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,790
Um...

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,590
My review was scheduled for three, right?

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,850
Huh? Wasn't it?

56
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,220
Oh! Right.

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,130
Yes, of course.

58
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,590
Okay, let's get started.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,660
- Have a seat.
- Excuse me.

60
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,610
Are you all right?

61
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:14,930
I'm fine.

62
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,760
Oh, right, okay, just a second.

63
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,970
Um...

64
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,790
Okay.

65
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,080
Shall we begin?

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,300
"10 Things I Want to Do Before I Turn 40"

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
(Get an amazing custom-made pillow)

68
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,970
Takoyaki party.

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,950
- It's piping hot, but so delicious.
- Oh, checking off your list, Suzume-chan?

70
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,190
Marine park.

71
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,790
Customizing orders at a cafe.

72
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,920
Fashion sense.

73
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,960
You're already halfway done.

74
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,350
This one...

75
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,440
isn't done yet.

76
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,520
Cake from the department store food court.

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,710
In progress.

78
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,780
And then...

79
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,120
Does that count as...

80
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,320
a kiss?

81
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,520
No.

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,210
A kiss on the forehead doesn't count?

83
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,070
But...

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,320
a kiss is a kiss.

85
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,790
For today...

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,880
let's stop here.

87
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,250
I don't want you to think I only came here for that.

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,410
Could it be...

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,960
he's serious?

90
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:55,850
No.

91
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,690
He could just be playing around...

92
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,110
Maybe it's better to just buy two new ones?

93
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,210
But then again, what am I even thinking?

94
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,600
But when I think about it...

95
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,070
I have no problem holding you.

96
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,870
He never said he likes me.

97
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,390
And he never asked me to be his boyfriend.

98
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,240
Argh.

99
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,730
I haven't dated in ten years.
I have no idea about this!

100
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,310
This is...

101
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,040
Is this love?

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,980
Huh?

103
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,530
It's an emergency, Suzume-chan.

104
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,550
Wow, this place is so chic.

105
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,010
Whoa!

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,660
I didn't know furniture stores
did custom-made pillows.

107
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,700
Oh! No, that's not it.

108
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,710
This is no time to be talking
about custom-made pillows.

109
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,600
Did something happen?

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,430
Its time was up.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,710
Its time?

112
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,370
It broke.

113
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,350
The pillow?
Yeah.

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,500
I didn't know pillows could break.

115
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,820
They do!

116
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,680
Oh, my bowl!

117
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,140
Your bowl?
Yeah.

118
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,050
It broke the other day.

119
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:48,870
Oh.

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,870
Want to take a look?

121
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,740
When it rains, it pours.

122
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,430
I wonder why that is.

123
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,130
So cute.

124
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,960
It really is.

125
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:01,960
So cute.

126
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,780
Well then...

127
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,820
Here.
Buy one for me, too.

128
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,900
This is my bowl at your place, Suzume-san.

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,220
Look.

130
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,530
This one's nice, too.

131
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,780
- It is nice.
- Right?

132
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,990
Let's get a matching pair later.

133
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,710
They're all so great.

134
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,980
Oh, there's so much more.

135
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,750
Suzume-san.

136
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,680
Over here.

137
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,770
This.

138
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,860
Don't you think this would be perfect for your place?

139
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,250
It's so cute.

140
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,500
Look.

141
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,490
Your living room is spacious.
This could be a nice accent piece.

142
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,330
I've always wanted one of these.

143
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,980
My eyesight isn't great, so I like a lot of light.

144
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,190
This is starting to feel like...

145
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,010
It feels like we're getting ready to move in together.

146
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,840
Wow, what a great design.

147
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,630
Suzume-san?

148
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,910
Oh, uh, no.

149
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,300
Pillows.

150
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm here to buy a pillow.

151
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,410
Uh... pillows.

152
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,090
Pillows are on the second floor.

153
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,690
If you'd like, I can show you around.

155
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,730
- Could you?
- Of course.

156
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,780
This model here...

157
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,330
provides excellent support for your spine right here.

158
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,220
So it's very comfortable.

159
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,510
If you had to choose, I'd recommend this one.

160
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,320
I'll take this one then.

161
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,890
Okay.
Hold on.

162
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,150
Why did you decide so quickly?

163
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,060
Oh... well...

164
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,070
This isn't cheap, you know.

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,090
Because she recommended it.

166
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,670
You're really bad at shopping.

167
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,930
Since we're already here,

168
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,490
let's look at all of them first.

169
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Excuse me.

170
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,040
Can we see the others?

171
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,250
Of course. Ah,

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,260
- If you're interested, you can also look at this one.
- Okay.

173
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,250
- This one is designed for side sleepers.
- This one, too...

174
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,360
He's so serious about this.

175
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,510
That's right.

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,170
Keishi has been serious from the very beginning.

177
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,090
About three years ago, Keishi...

178
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,040
was transferred to my department.

179
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,750
This is Tanaka-kun, new to our department.

180
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,960
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

181
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,280
Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,330
We have a second Tanaka in the department now!

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,580
We do.

184
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,000
So what should we call you?

185
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,540
Um...
Oh!

186
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,310
I'm Tanaka.

187
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,430
I was here first.

188
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,020
- So annoying.
- Got it.

189
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
You can just call me by my first name.

190
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,120
By the way, it's pronounced 'Keishi, ' not 'Keiji.'

191
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,860
Oh, I see.

192
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,880
Keishi-kun.

193
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,800
You don't need the '-kun.'

194
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,360
Alright then.

195
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,680
Keishi.

196
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,690
Okay.

197
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,410
I still have a lot to learn,

198
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,050
but I hope you'll bear with me.

199
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,260
- I'm in your care.
- What are you, my new bride?

200
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,570
So, shall we begin?

201
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,260
Yes.

202
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,250
Despite his appearance, he's very polite.

203
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,520
Thank you.

204
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,030
- He's just playing around...
- Please, take your time.

205
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,450
No...

206
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,270
He's not that kind of guy.

207
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,590
Oh.

208
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,560
Whoa! I could fall asleep on this instantly.

209
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,460
About you...

210
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,550
I always thought I knew you pretty well.

211
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,580
Suzume-san, you try it too.

212
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,160
Mhm.

213
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
But...

214
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,830
I never imagined that you and I were "the same."

215
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,230
What do you think?

216
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,640
It's great, right?

217
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,730
But...

218
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,310
now that I know...

219
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,570
It's great...

220
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,090
In the end, I only bought one pillow.

221
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,510
A floor lamp.

222
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,670
So that's how it is.

223
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,970
I wonder if it's too dim for him.

224
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,330
It should be fine, right?

225
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,290
But...

226
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,990
I myself...

227
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,740
can't say anything yet.

228
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,040
Suzume-chan.

229
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,910
If you overthink things,

230
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,900
you won't be able to sleep.

231
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,970
Good morning.

232
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,260
- Good morning.
- Morning.

233
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,880
Morning.

234
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,670
Tojo-san.

235
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,810
Is 6 PM okay for the get-together tonight?

236
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,530
No, it's to celebrate with Tanaka.

237
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,710
He landed a new project.

238
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,930
Mhm.

239
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,030
Yeah, no problem.

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,550
Great, thanks.

241
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,170
Morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.

242
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,010
Suzume-san...

243
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,860
he has a habit of being too considerate of others.

244
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,320
- Good morning.
- Morning.

245
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,050
- Morning.
- Morning.
Good morning.

246
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,710
You shouldn't push yourself so hard.

247
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,720
Huh?

248
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,250
About the gathering.

249
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,460
What about it?

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,910
Of course I'm going.

251
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,020
And he never truly shows his feelings in front of me.

252
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,800
I'm awesome for taking the first step!

253
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,940
Wow, if things keep going this smoothly,

254
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,430
I'll definitely have a date this Christmas Eve.

255
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,670
It always comes back to that with you, doesn't it?

256
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,850
It's been two years!
Hey, Keishi,

257
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,330
where's a good place to go for a Christmas date?

258
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,400
Are you okay?

259
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,620
Sorry, sorry, I'm fine, I'm fine...

260
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,110
What were we just talking about?

261
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,010
Christmas Eve.

262
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,280
Speaking of which,
isn't your birthday on Christmas Eve, Tojo-san?

263
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,990
Yeah.

264
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,440
Christmas and your birthday.
That's really something to celebrate.

265
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,600
You must really go all out on your dates then.

266
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,140
No.

267
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,850
It's been a while since I've had someone like that.

268
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,960
A while?

269
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,370
When you say "a while," how long are we talking?

270
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:10,800
A year? Two years?

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,760
No...

272
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,120
Wait, don't tell me it's been longer!

273
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,760
You should really try a dating app.

274
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,990
Oh yeah, there are apps for that.

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,210
With those things,

276
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,850
your profile picture is really important.

277
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,000
Wait a sec...

278
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,700
- Oh.
- This is too much.

279
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,430
No.

280
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,090
It's fine, it's fine.

281
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,330
Ah.

282
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,800
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Okay.

283
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,670
Suzume-san, are you all right?

284
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm fine, really, I'm fine.

285
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,330
You all enjoy yourselves.

286
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,790
I'm going to head home.

287
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll see him home.

288
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,090
- That's okay.
- Let's go.

289
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,650
Thank you.

290
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:54,980
- Okay, let's go.
- Sorry about this.

291
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,640
- Sorry, everyone.
- We're heading out.

292
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,090
- Get home safe.
- See you tomorrow.

293
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,380
Suzume-san?

294
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,160
It's probably hard to get a cab right now.

295
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,830
Let's find a place to sit for a bit.

296
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,240
Sorry about this.

297
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,870
Here's some water.

298
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,660
Thanks.

299
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,580
You're already sleep-deprived,
and you're still pushing yourself so hard.

300
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,410
No,

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,580
it's nothing...

302
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,300
I can tell just by looking at you.

303
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,230
Is the pillow not a good fit?

304
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,110
No, that's not it.

305
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,660
Hmm... Maybe we should've gotten you
a custom-made one after all.

306
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,640
No, it's fine.

307
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,110
I really like that one.

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,930
Really?

309
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,380
Really.

310
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,990
Because you were there with me when I picked it out.

311
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,590
Then...

312
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,910
why can't you sleep?

313
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,490
I...

314
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,370
my heart starts racing...

315
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,630
when I'm with you,
my heart is always pounding.

316
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
It's happening right now.

317
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,220
And it happens even when I'm not with you.

318
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,460
I keep wondering what you're thinking.

319
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,890
I'm always thinking about things like that.

320
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,920
My heart just won't stop pounding.

321
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,390
But...

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,130
when you stood up for me earlier, I was so happy.

323
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,210
Right now...

324
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,800
just this is enough for me.

325
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:32,850
Suzume-san's true feelings...

326
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,980
Suzume-san.

327
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,780
You know...

328
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,990
up until now,

329
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,570
I've only ever fallen for straight guys.

330
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,640
Anyone I was interested in always liked girls.

331
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,550
So...

332
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,310
it was always over before it could even begin.

333
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,570
As a reaction to that,

334
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,970
I went through a phase where I'd say yes to anyone.

335
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,610
But nothing ever lasted very long.

336
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,680
This...

337
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,850
is the first time...

338
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,040
I've been able to be like this with someone I truly like.

339
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,000
That's why...

340
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,830
I decided I'll never do anything
that could get us found out at work...

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,420
You're asleep?

342
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,830
Keishi's taking forever.

343
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,260
He sure is.

344
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,950
I'll try calling him.

345
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,870
I'll go pay the bill, then.

346
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,030
Okay, thanks.

347
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,550
- Udagawa-san.
- Huh?

348
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,620
A minute ago, Keishi...

349
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,230
Did he call Tojo-san "Suzume-san"?

350
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,840
Huh? Did he?

351
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah.

352
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,430
I guess we're not going back.

353
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,250
The rest of the items on the list.

354
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,380
There are still four left.

355
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,870
After we finish them all...

356
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,750
our relationship...

357
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,210
what will it become?

358
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,080
On weekends...

359
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,400
as lovers...

360
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,280
In the end, if we don't say it out loud...

361
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,120
we'll never really know.

362
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,230
I'm not mature enough to just accept it.

363
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
I have to tell you how I really feel.

364
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,920
That I...

365
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,420
love Tojo-san.
