am cooking

75
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Well

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
You didn't eat yet,right?

77
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,140
between Ruanzhi and Bailu in television drama

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,280
I

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
Sure.Let me have a look. I cooked some noodles.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Hey

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
How hungry you are.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,600
Eat up then

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Thank you

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,480
Wow

85
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Instant noodles are so delicious.

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,840
what's wrong?

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,240
Mmm

88
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,400
How did you know that I didn't have dinner?

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,840
You don't have time to eat because you just finish the live.

90
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,600
Hum

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,480
I know it must be you.

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Tell me

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
Are you the one who just gave me the gift?

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
So you come here, just wanna ask me this question

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,880
Don't indulge in sophistry

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,680
I know it is you

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
It's me

98
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
Mr.Yan told me

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,840
that you will live broadcast this afternoon

100
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,040
So I stopped by and had a look.

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
I didn't expect

102
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
to see those

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
so I would help you definitly.

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Ruanruan

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
I will always guard by your side

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
Let me show you something

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Whenever I shoot these things,I always think

108
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,160
whether I have a chance

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,040
to show you these sceneries

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
or not

111
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,720
In the past two years when I travelled

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Sometimes it's for visiting some famous buildings.

113
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
visiting some famous buildings.

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,040
Sometimes it's for understanding local customs and practices

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,280
local customs and practices

116
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
When I see something funny

117
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll think of you.

118
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,040
When I see some delicious food

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll think of you

120
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,680
When I see some beautiful sceneries

121
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,560
I'll think of you

122
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,000
If you were by my side

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,720
I'm sorry Qizhan

124
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,240
If I hadn't been

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
so impulsive at that time.

126
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Ruanruan

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,280
Those lonely days

128
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Tough days

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,240
passed away.

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
Woukd you like to see the future sceneries with me?

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
see the future sceneries with me?

132
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
I remember when you asked me this question at that time

133
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
when you asked me this question at that time

134
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
My answer?

135
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
Actually

136
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,600
After you left,

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
I feeled really sad.

138
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,600
It's Mr.Lilan

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,360
He was always by my side

140
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,000
and help me out of the trouble.

141
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,760
So

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
I don't know

143
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
I am grateful to him

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
or

145
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
some other emotions

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
exactly

147
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,080
Ruanruan

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
But after today's live broadcast

149
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,840
I know that

150
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,880
For Mr.Lilan,

151
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm respected and worshiped in career

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,000
I really appreciate his help.

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,160
but

154
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,080
These gratitude

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,480
won't affect my mood.

156
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
But you are different

157
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Do you know

158
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,920
When I think about

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
he person who are opposite the camera

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,320
is you

161
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
My heart beats faster.

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,160
I can't sit for a second.

163
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
So Qizhan

164
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
I

165
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
Why you eat jelly in the morning?

166
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
This is my breakfast.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
That's all you have for breakfast

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
You don't know

169
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm on diet recently

170
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Eating a jelly

171
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,720
is just fine

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,480
No way

173
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
I prepared breakfast for you.

174
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
You have prepared so much.

175
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
Wow

176
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Please stop here

177
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
I got off first.

178
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,400
It's not good to let colleagues see us later

179
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,400
Ha ha ha

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
We need be careful in the office.

181
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,120
What's wrong?

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,280
Mr.Qi

183
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,920
Good morning

184
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,160
Uh

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Morning, Mr.Yan

186
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,560
Are you walking?

187
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,400
Yes, we are walking now.

188
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
I saw  that someone was driving

189
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
in your passenger seat just now.

190
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,360
Uh

191
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,400
Was it?

192
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,160
Ah

193
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,040
Ha ha

194
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,400
Nobody

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Nobody

196
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,280
Uh Mmm

197
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,000

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,000
You didn't see it before

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,280

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,840
Who is in his car?

230
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,840
It must be a woman.

231
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,720
Wow

232
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,840

236
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,840
Mr.Qi

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,560
According to the current progress for <<Yu Hua Cuo>>

238
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,720
Three episodes a day

239
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,600
By next week

240
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
we could complete the whole dubbing mission

241
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
The completed part

242
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
has already transfered to the producer.

243
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,000

245
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,960
ahead of schedule.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
And it's a little rushed.

247
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,400
Well

248
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,080

What are you looking at?

250
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Why the big smile?

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,480
Nothing

252
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Especially <<Chun Xu Qiu Feng>>

253
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,240
It's rushed for trial

254
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,080

255
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
We redrafted

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,320
an expedited contract

257
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,080
The other company's legal affairs are being audited.

258
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
It's said that they will give feedback this afternoon.

259
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,280
If there are no questions

260
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,840
We will start it at all

261
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
Well It's end

262
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000

272
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,920

276
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,800

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,600
Who is he?

292
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,440

302
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,040
Did you love someone before?

303
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
So you refused me

304
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,440
No

305
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
It's just happened recently

306
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,720
I am disppointed in love

307
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480

But you need buy me a meal

312
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,440
To make up for

313
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,080
my broken heart.

314
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,480

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
Bailu has some suggestions

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,360
She needs addictional recording

398
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,080
Um

399
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,240

414
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,920

415
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,240

Aren't you staying in the company to do the addictional recording?

422
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,160

423
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,360
Steal away and see the art exhibition

424
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,120

425
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,680
Was there a boy?

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,800

427
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,240

432
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,240

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760

438
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,040
Umm

439
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,920
He has some other things to do

440
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,240
Maybe it's too late when he come back

441
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,560
Don't you want to see the art exhibition?

442
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,680
If you are late, it will close soon

443
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Hurry up Hurry up

444
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,560
We could see your boyfriend next time

445
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,560
Uh

446
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Um

447
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,320
We will dubbing tomorrow.

449
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Let's talk about something about that

450
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,880
Are you angry?

451
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh

452
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,640
How to see the art exhibition in that instance

453
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,520
How about going there one more tomorrow

454
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
Mr.Qizhan is handsome

455
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,600
Mr.Qizhan is my love

456
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,720
Are you happy now?

457
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480
This is man.

458
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,920
What's wrong?

459
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,760
I always hurt.

460
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
Why I feel you are wronged

461
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,360
What

462
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,400
did I do something wrong?

463
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,480
Why are you guilty?

464
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
About our relationship,

465
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,040
You are so scared that others know that

466
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,680
It's not Scared

467
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't prepare to face it.

468
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,320
Ruanruan

469
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,720
I don't wanna force you

470
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,080
I wanna stay with you in any time

471
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,120
It's just like this.

472
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,240
We didn't see the art exhibition and then went home.

473
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
He didn't answer me even when I tried to tickle him

474
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,440
Taotao

475
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,800
Am I excessive?

476
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,520
Ruanzhi

477
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,440
I don't know

478
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,880
You are a bad girl

479
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,480
What?

480
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,680
You even think I'm a bad girl

481
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,920
Of course

482
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,880
About you

483
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,440
You agreed with him

484
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,160
Then announced it in the Moment

485
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,360
In the end, you want to hide him and wanna nobody knows he is your boyfriend.

486
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,280
You make a true love

487
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,640
become secret fling

488
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,800
Unless

489
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Unless what

490
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,360
You treat him as a back-up.

491
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,960
Oh,what are you saying?

492
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,160
Mainly

493
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
You know each other

494
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,680
It's a little bit Embarrassed

495
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,800
We know

496
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,080
He is Qizhan?

497
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
Ruanzhi

498
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,040
You still fall in love with him, right?

499
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,880
When is it?

500
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,800
Is it on my birthay?

501
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,680
At that night

502
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,440
Did you

503
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,480
combined viciously

504
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,920
act in collusion with each other

505
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,160
work with thieves?

506
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,320
Whoops No

507
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,040
It's just happened recently

508
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Mainly

509
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
I don't how to tell you guys about it.

510
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,120
It's easy

511
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,200
Let me tell you a good idea

512
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,440
At the singing party

513
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,760
you annouce Qizhan is your boyfriend.

514
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,760
I promise

515
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Evrything will be OK

516
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,320
Nice

517
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,200
Taotao is so clever

518
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,280
You are so smart

519
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,640
Why you have a such clever brain

520
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,280
What a good idea

521
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,760
Are you Ruanzhi?

522
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,600
That is not a fact.

523
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,400
It must be someone who wanna trap her

524
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,000
She is a little Internet celebrity

525
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,480
Why do they trap her

526
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Yes

527
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,600
You are right

528
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Yep

529
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,000
Zhi

530
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,640
Yes

531
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,000
Mr.Qi wanna talk to you

532
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,600
Ok

533
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,040
Uh

534
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,720
Zhi

535
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
Eerything will be better

536
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,160
What?

537
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,600
What?

538
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,040
What happened?

539
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,720
Come to see it

540
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,600
What's the meaning?

541
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
When I see that

542
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,200
It's already on the second in the trending topic list

543
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
Arguably

544
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,440
It's usual to dubbing for Bailu

545
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,040
But why it is in the trending topic

546
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,160
According to the source

547
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,280
Ruanzhi admit to

548
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,480
sing the Bailu's new song.

549
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,840
Replacing is a truth.

550
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,480
Then compared voices

551
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,360
It is found that the voices are same,they are from one person.

552
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
So

553
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,440
That's the point

554
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
In that afternooon

555
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,760
I saw you in the Sunny Recording Studio

556
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,400
You were recording that song,right?

557
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,080
Yes

558
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,440
Ruanruan

559
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,760
You

560
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,600
singed that song?

561
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
I'm sorry Qizhan

562
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,840
I

563
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
really don't

564
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
want to see things like this way.

565
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,520
What does it affect on Bailu?

566
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,400
For Bailu, It's ok.

567
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,160
Her studio just need to release a statement.

568
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,400
What I worry about is

569
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,280
her followers will hurt you.

570
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
For me, it's ok.

571
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
When it calms down, everything will be ok

572
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,400
Maybe several days later

573
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,600
After all,they won't oppose the person

574
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,280
who is a little unknow dubbing actor

575
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,280
Right?

576
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:57,760
Don't worry

577
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,520
I'm always by your side

578
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,520
Yes

579
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,200
Uh

580
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,520
Are you still angry now?

581
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,720
I am not angry about you

582
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,440
You shoudn't accept the work like this

583
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,520
Yes

584
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,080
Bailu's followers like idol followers

585
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,760
are so young

586
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,440
and so impulsive

587
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,400
So I 'm worried about you

588
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,760
Something wrong

589
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,880
There are many Bailu's followers at the company's gate

590
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,840
