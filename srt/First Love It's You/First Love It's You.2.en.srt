1
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Why should I do soup for him?

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
It' s his fault.

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,280
He didn't leave after work,

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,560
and scared me at night.

5
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,040
He asked me to cook soup for him?

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,760
Even I didn't ask him for the mental anguish!

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
Sorry!

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm sorry, Qi Zhan.

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I' m really sorry.

10
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,560
That's not all my fault,

11
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
right?

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't really have a choice.

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,280
It' s too late. I'm a girl,

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,840
and there is nobody except me in the company,

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm so scared.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,480
Suddenly, a black shadow appeared,

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,400
and made noise around.

18
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't you go back?

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,320
I

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,120
do

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
How about go to the hospital?

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
I could afford your medical care.

23
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
I was injured.

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
Does apology work?

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,400
What else do you want from me?

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Soup.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I think the soup made by you are delicious.

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
Hello, Master,

29
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm cooking soup, please speak in the voicemail.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
What' s happening?

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,120
Why are you cooking this late?

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Are you forget eating dinner for work?

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,160
That's not the case actually.

34
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,800
when I was coming off work,

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
I accidentally hurted a colleague.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
so I want to give him a soup

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,440
for apology.

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
Master you call me  at now,

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,600
what's up?

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,400
It's a blessing in disguise for your colleague.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
Nothing.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
I forgot to

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
confirm the specific time

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
of your next live.

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
I need to arrange in advance.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
The specific time?

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,440
Hold on.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
I need to determine the theme of the live.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,240
By the way,

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Master, do yu know

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,080
Mo Ruyu joined in our studio.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
We've known each other for a long time,

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,120
and we studied in the same university.

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
But we haven't collaborate with each other.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
I' m so expecting the work.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,960
Sorry, I have to hang up.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,520
OK.

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
I 'm late again.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
I catch you again.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Don't say it.

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Come here.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
I tell you,

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
did you see Mr. Qi

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,920
in the morning?

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,720
WOW,

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,280
There is a big bruise on his bridge of the nose.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,240
He told me

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,120
he was hit

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,840
by the door.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Later, I will see it of my eyes.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
He is in there.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
You gather us together

73
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,950
only for talking about gossip?

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,240
To the point,

75
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,270
I gather you together

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
for a custume drama.

77
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,120
Love Unexpected.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,070
The cast asked our studio to do dub.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,000
The lead actress is Bai Lu, the famous actress.

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
You can dub her part.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,160
About the led actor,

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
I intended to ask Ruyu,

83
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,480
but now,

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
there may be another arrangement.

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,920
What?

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,360
Is there anyone better than me

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
to fit the the character?

88
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,920
Don't worry.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
I told the film maker.

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
But they

91
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,160
want Mr.LIlan.

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,800
Mr. Lilan?

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Yan,

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
you mean

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,360
I would work with

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,160
Mr. Lilan in this play?

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
But I heard that

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
he never do dub offline.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,480
Well,

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
this is not the end.

102
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
Mr. Lilan would sign a contract with our studio,

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,160
and work with you in our group.

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,480
Well,

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,480
What's this?

106
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
It's not your thing.

107
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,190
Go to work.

108
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
Go!

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,600
Ah.

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,560
Ah

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,720
What's wrong with him?

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
Little Zhi,

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
poor me!

114
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Well.

115
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
What' s this?

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,390
This?

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,480
Well,

118
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
It's my soup.

119
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,680
Do you want to try some?

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I do another soup for Qi Zhan tomorrow.

121
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,240
I believe that

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
It's so delicious!

123
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
If I can drink it everyday,

124
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,160
I

125
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,600
I would like to give up to be a main CV.

126
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Worth it !

127
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Look at you.

128
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
It's too delicious!

129
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
In returen,

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
I take you out for lunch

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,280
and dinner.

132
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,160
Well, it 's just a soup.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
What 's this?

134
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,160
It's the corn spareribs soup.

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,680
Little Zhi cooked it for me.

136
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,360
Don't drink overnight soup.

137
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
there is too much purine in it.

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,480
Why is he being so sinppy!

139
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,920
If it really is like that

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Here, your soup.

141
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
Have a taste.

142
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,920
What?

143
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,800
when the god can't help,

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
only the soup

145
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
can rescue us!

146
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,440
Hello

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,920
Zhi

148
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,640
Hi

149
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
I'm going abroad

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh Congratulations

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Um

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
What about you

153
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
What are you going to do after graduation

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,360
I'm looking for a job

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,840
Actually

156
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,280
You could come with me

157
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,280
I got things to do

158
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,200
Gotta go

159
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
Thank you

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
For saying goodbye to me -

161
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
A friend of yours

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,280
Good luck with your study

163
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,760
This is the best drinking spot

164
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah

165
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,640
Who would've thought that the spot we found back then

166
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
Would become our secret base

167
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,520
Even now after graduation

168
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,040
We still want to sneak back here

169
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,800
It feels like nothing matters that much anymore

170
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
When we sit here and chill

171
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Do you still remember that

172
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
After your break up with QiZhan

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,600
You also came up here by yourself

174
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,720
And cried a lot

175
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,880
It's been so long

176
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,480
Why do you even bring that up

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,640
And back then

178
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,080
We weren't really dating

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,600
So I wouldn't call it a break up

180
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,640
And this time

181
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
He didn't come back for me

182
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,920
Maybe

183
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,200
He's already with someone

184
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,800
Um

185
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,880
Although I always thought that

186
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,760
There must be some misunderstanding

187
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
Between you two

188
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,320
But I don't think

189
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,200
There's been major changes within these two years

190
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,040
Uh huh

191
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
But all of sudden he came back

192
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
And became your boss

193
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,360
This is too much of a coincidence

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,240
Right

195
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,960
You also think it's weird right

196
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,320
I always think that

197
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,040
Normally

198
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
People like him

199
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
Should go work at a foreign company

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
After coming back

201
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,200
Right

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,240
Why would he

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
Come and work for our little studio

204
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,640
Although

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,040
He left together with LinShiluo

206
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
But I don't think

207
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,920
There's anything between them two

208
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,880
Right

209
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,960
Hum

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,760
But right now

211
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,040
That has nothing to do with me

212
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
Why not

213
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,160
As soon as Qizhan came back

214
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,720
You got your one million fans promotion

215
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
KPI mission

216
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,200
You're not helping

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,720
And you're being sarcastic

218
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,920
Stop it

219
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,440
Alright alright

220
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
Have some jelly

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,200
It's peach flavored

222
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,960
Your favorite

223
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,880
Thanks

224
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Hum

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,960
Uh

226
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
That saved me

227
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
Come on

228
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
You're the goddess of our Xinyin club

229
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
You can't get beaten up by these little things

230
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040
Xinyin

231
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,440
Shanzhi

232
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
Flowers will be withered

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,480
But love will never be

234
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,960
The wind will blow away your existence

235
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,280
Next month

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Be generous on my paycheck

237
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,280
Flower will bloom again

238
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,960
But can we meet again

239
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,520
I really like you

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,120
You scared me Taotao

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,080
Signing up form for life clubs

242
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,600
They are handing them out downstairs

243
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
Take a look and see if there's anything you like

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm busy right now

245
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,400
There's no time for me to do that

246
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
A kind reminder

247
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
Life club activities

248
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Will be counted as credits

249
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,280
There's not other way to make up to it

250
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Taekwondo club

251
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,840
No no

252
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,600
Art club cooking club

253
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,280
These are so ordinary

254
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,600
I agree

255
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,280
How about

256
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,720
We start up our own club

257
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,840
The basic requirement is three people

258
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,400
What club though

259
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
Dubbing club

260
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I know a guy

261
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,960
He could help

262
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,520
Hi everyone I'm Shanzhi

263
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,080
Yeah cheers

264
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
I never thought that

265
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,640
We could have our club reunion

266
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
Everyone's here

267
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,160
This is so nice

268
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
Shanzhi

269
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,280
You'll always be the best president of ours

270
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,160
um

271
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
I haven't done dubbing in years

272
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Zhi

273
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm so happy to see you doing so well now

274
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Congratulations

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
Thanks

276
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,280
I wouldn't be doing this job

277
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,640
And become who I am

278
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,840
If it weren't for your support

279
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,720
Looking at you guys now

280
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,280
Reminds me of the old times

281
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,520
I had the best time

282
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,720
When we were back in Xinyin

283
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,600
Yes

284
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,840
It was so unforgettable

285
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,760
But luckily

286
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm working with Zhi again

287
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,880
That being said

288
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,480
This is also the main idea of our union

289
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,160
Wow

290
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
So you're saying

291
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,200
We could complete our KPI mission

292
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,280
With a Xinyin club come-back show

293
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,160
That's right

294
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,960
We were really popular back then

295
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
So we could definitely succeed

296
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,720
If we have our come-back

297
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,920
Okay

298
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,080
I'll do it if you ask me to

299
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,960
I also think this is a very good opportunity

300
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,400
For Xinyin to come back to business

301
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,160
And

302
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,600
Since we are back together

303
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,080
We should do something as us

304
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,840
Come-back show

305
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,440
That sounds really appealing

306
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,920
Okay

307
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
I'll take care of the equipment and the site

308
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,200
Come on

309
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,280
For our come-back

310
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,360
Fighting

311
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,160
Fighting

312
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
Fighting

313
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,400
Wow

314
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
This is really cute

315
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,640
I look so cute

316
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,080
Oh my

317
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,720
True love is going to evolve

318
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's look at your video

319
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,160
No

320
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,160
Don't look at mine

321
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,200
Hey hey

322
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Hey

323
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,760
Hey

324
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Ready

325
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,280
But you can't do that

326
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:11,640
Uh

327
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,120
You look like an idiot

328
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,600
Oh my

329
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
You're not being polite

330
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
Later

331
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll ask Taotao

332
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,600
To record an other version in Tuantuan's voice

333
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,160
And Shanzhi

334
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,400
In Luffy's voice

335
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,840
I see

336
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,960
Then I'll edit them

337
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,840
Into one video and upload it

338
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
It'll be a hit

339
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Zhi

340
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,120
You're such a marketing genius

341
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm alright

342
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,360
But

343
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,840
If we

344
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,280
Ask LiLangongzi

345
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,040
to help us record an other version

346
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,600
Do you think he'll agree

347
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,000
We could also send him

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,880
An invitation to our show

349
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,480
Ah

350
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,520
LiLangongzi

351
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,080
I talked to him before on the internet

352
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
You can trust me with this

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Are you guys familiar with each other

354
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
We weren't before

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,400
But

356
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,480
Now that

357
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
He works in our studio

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,120
As a co-worker

359
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
He will definitely help us

360
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,400
Huh

361
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,720
Okay

362
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm on it

363
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,840
Zhi

364
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,520
Actually

365
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,160
I wanted to tell you that

366
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,200
Meeting time everyone

367
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,520
Coming

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,720
We'll continue later

369
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,600
Okay meeting first

370
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040
It's not benefiting if you come with

371
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
Why are you always thinking about benefits

372
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,440
Because my job itself

373
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,040
Is not benefiting our relationship

374
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,880
But

375
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm still going with you

376
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,680
It's all set

377
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't worry

378
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
The flight leaves tomorrow night

379
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,400
Wait

380
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,760
What about Ruanzhi

381
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,880
I haven't figured out how to tell her yet

382
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,240
Zhi

383
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,040
About the monologue

384
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
RuanZhi

385
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,600
Ruanzhi

386
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,360
Yes

387
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,040
You look distracted

388
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm saying that

389
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,240
You need to redo the monologue dubbing

390
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Your tone and emotion should be similar to this

391
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,520
But lower

392
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,160
Alright

393
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,520
After this case

394
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,240
Starting tomorrow

395
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,440
We could get in the dubbing job

396
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,960
For

397
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,440
Okay

398
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
What's wrong

399
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
You don't look so good

400
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,040
Wait

401
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
I know

402
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,960
Are you worried that

403
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,360
You can't hit the one million fans promotion target

404
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,400
Huh

405
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,360
Don't worry

406
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
You know what

407
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,800
Things will eventually sort themselves out

408
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I have faith in you

409
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,400
Guys

410
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I know everyone's been working hard recently

411
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,480
To be better prepared

412
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,720
For the new challenge tomorrow

413
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,480
So I've decided that

414
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,480
We go and have fun at our old spot tonight

415
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,360
I call the mic

416
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,080
Don't try to fight me for it

417
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Hey guys guys

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,320
Listen

419
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,680
Here's to a good wish

420
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,400
For completing the dubbing job

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,560
For

422
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,240
Cheers

423
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,280
Oh

424
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:58,840
Oh oh oh

425
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,600
Oh

426
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Come on guys

427
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,600
Oh oh oh

428
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,600
Why is Mr.Qi here

429
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh

430
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,640
Uh

431
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,120
Have fun you guys

432
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,840
Tonight's on me

433
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,800
Mr.Qi is the best

434
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,840
Thank you Mr.Qi

435
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Mr.Qi is the best

436
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
Thank you Mr.Qi

437
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,120
Mr.Qi is the best Thank you Mr.Qi

438
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,120
Yeah

439
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,520
Oh woo

440
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
What's happening

441
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,040
He never comes to this kind of parties

442
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,320
Zhi

443
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
Sing with me

444
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,280
It's a love song duet

445
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,840
Ruyu really has a way with girls

446
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,760
Exactly

447
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm so jealous

448
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,400
Even I am falling for him

449
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,920
Sorry

450
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,840
That was a mistake

451
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,720
What do you want to sing Mr.Qi

452
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,800
I'll find it for you

453
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,720
I'll help you find the song

454
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,840
Thanks I'm not a good singer

455
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,080
Mr.Qi

456
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Sing

457
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,080
Mr.Qi

458
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Sing

459
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,160
Mr.Qi

460
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,120
Sing

461
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:36,040
Mr.Qi Sing

462
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
We're at KTV

463
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Mr.Lilan don't act like this

464
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,560
We all work together

465
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,040
How can you not come to the team building

466
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,440
Mr.Lilan

467
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,160
Do you still remember the friend that I told you before

468
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,960
The one whose voice sounds a lot like you

469
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,920
Yes why

470
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
It's only the voice that's similar

471
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,280
There's no way that it's him

472
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
You've got to sing this song with me

473
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,160
Come on Zhi

474
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,520
QiZhan

475
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,160
Let go of me QiZhan

476
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,400
What do you want

477
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,160
QiZhan

478
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,120
Why did you pull me out

479
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,800
If I didn't do this

480
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,360
You'd be singing love songs with someone else

481
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,920
Did you forget about your promises

482
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,720
Promise me

483
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,480
You'll only sing love duet with me

484
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,680
I remember every sentence

485
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,680
And every single word

486
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,600
That you've said

487
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
Especially the ones you said to LinShiluo

488
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,120
Ruanruan

489
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,920
What happened back then

490
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
Was a misunderstanding

491
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,400
RuanZhi

492
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,560
Hi Shiluo

493
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
Lone time no see

494
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
RuanZhi

495
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,120
What a coincidence

496
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,480
I heard from QiZhan

497
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,600
That you guys are coworkers now

498
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
I've been thinking about

499
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Meeting you sometime

500
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,400
I had not expected

501
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
To be seeing you today

502
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,520
Right

503
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
Zhi

504
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Everyone's waiting for you

505
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,920
Let's go back in

506
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,040
I was just about to

507
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,360
Let's go

508
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Hey

509
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,040
I told you to stay out of it

510
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Stay out

511
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Just because I stayed out of it before

512
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,840
Someone has regretted for two years

513
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm worried about it now

514
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,920
It worries the worry person

515
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,520
Who are you referring to

516
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,080
I'm your auntie

517
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,400
Show me some respect

518
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
Can you just leave me alone

519
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
You were the exact reason why

520
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,040
Zhi misunderstood me

521
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
If you step in again

522
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
It's going to be really hard to explain

523
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,240
You

524
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:16,800
Humph

525
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,200
Eh

526
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,320
Zhi

527
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,800
We were having fun

528
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,040
Why are you leaving

529
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm a little tired

530
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,800
I wanna go back and rest

531
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,040
It's been tough lately

532
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,800
And the new project is starting tomorrow

533
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,360
It's a good idea

534
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,400
To go back early and rest

535
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:44,960
yes

536
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,200
RuanZhi

537
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,600
Right You never notice me

538
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm sorry Ruyu

539
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,640
I was thinking about something

540
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
About QiZhan

541
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,200
What are you talking about

542
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm gonna take a bus

543
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,800
At the bus station over there

544
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,760
You don't need to walk me there

545
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,400
Um

546
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,360
Go back and rest

547
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
Zhi

548
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,040
I wanna tell you something

549
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,640
How about we talk about it tomorrow

550
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
This might disappoint you

551
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,920
I contacted Mr.Lilan

552
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,360
Asking him to come to our show

553
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,480
But he turned me down

554
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,360
Oh

555
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
That's okay

556
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,280
Then

557
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
I'll think of something else with Shanzhi tomorrow

558
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
RuanZhi I like you

559
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
I know you're still not over QiZhan

560
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,040
But I like you

561
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,720
I

562
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,960
I liked you at first sight

563
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,600
But

564
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,160
I was never brave enough to tell you

565
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
But now QiZhan is back

566
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
I know that if I don't say it now

567
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,920
I will never get the chance to say it

568
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,040
Ruyu

569
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm sorry I

570
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,360
You don't have to say anything now

571
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,920
As long as

572
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
You haven't made up your mind

573
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,640
I can always wait

574
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
You knew I liked you

575
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,400
You knew it all along

576
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,280
Why do you do this to me

577
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,840
I told you long time ago

578
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,960
Don't

579
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,120
Waste your time on me

580
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,480
It's destined

581
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
That we can't be together because of who I am

582
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,040
I'm sorry let's start over

583
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,240
Excuse me I'm not feeling well

584
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,280
What's wrong

585
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,280
It was all my fault

586
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,520
I took them to team building last night

587
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
And she came here so early in the morning

588
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,520
It must've been a lack of rest

589
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,600
Mr.Qi

590
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm concerned about RuanZhi's condition

591
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,040
This drama

592
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,080
Is very important for Bailu

593
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
We are all counting on it

594
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,280
To win the prize

595
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,200
She can handle it

596
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm sure you all know

597
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,920
How professional RuanZhi is

598
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Otherwise

599
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
She would've became the personal dubbing artist for Bailu

600
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Right

601
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm not gonna bother

602
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,800
Since you said so

603
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,360
How about the lead actor

604
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,400
Mr.Lilan has his own team

605
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,800
Once he's done

606
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,480
We will finish the mixing and editing

607
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
With a great reputation

608
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,080
Of Mr.Lilan

609
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,360
Our drama is going to be a big hit

610
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,240
Of course

611
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,880
The news of Mr.Lilan

612
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,600
Dubbing for the lead actor

613
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,080
Wow

614
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,040
Has been trending for days

615
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,040
You know what

616
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,920
It's lunch time

617
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
How about we move this to the lunch table

618
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,440
Please

619
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,280
Mr.Qi

620
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,680
Can I have a minute with you

621
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,240
QiZhan

622
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,800
You still have feelings for RuahZhi don't you

623
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,640
That's my business

624
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
If there's nothing else you want to say

625
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,560
Then excuse me

626
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,760
Aren't you curious

627
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,880
About why RuanZhi has been distracted today

628
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
I confessed to her last night

629
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,320
She turned you down

630
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,720
You still like her

631
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Two years ago

632
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
I thought you guys were dating

633
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,840
So I stayed as a friend

634
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,760
And never crossed the line

635
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,520
So

636
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,320
You two are not dating now

637
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
You are right

638
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,000
But you also didn't seize the chance yourself

639
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,880
Now we're at the same starting point

640
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,040
QiZhan

641
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,240
Do you dare to have a fair competition with me
