1
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,520
I'll quit the talk.

2
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,520
I'm almost home.

3
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,520
Hanging up.

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:10,800
Bye.

5
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
A stalker has been active recently.

6
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,440
He picks out the single girl

7
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
who has left the night shift.

8
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,400
Next,we will

9
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,470
rich experiences in live streaming.

10
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey.

11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Why are you here?

12
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Are you alright?

13
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,160
You look out of breathe.

14
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
I'm fine.

15
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,360
I was jogging.

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,040
We're having a party at the bar next door.

17
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,960
Just a bunch of friends.

18
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,640
Some of them are cute.

19
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,480
Do you wanna join?

20
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,000
Sure

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm free now.

22
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,760
Let's go.

23
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,400
Ruan Zhi, get in!

24
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,840
Scared hell out of me.

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,200
Are you okay?

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm fine.

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,480
Thank you.

28
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
How come you are here?

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,720
I was looking for you.

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,640
Luckily you're all right.

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,280
Otherwise I will probably get

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
blamed really hard.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,280
What?

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,120
Hey.

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,280
Stay with her tonight.

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,760
Um.

37
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Do not worry.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,880
I know.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,400
Hanging up.

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
I try to be back early.

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,680
Okay, got it.

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Bye.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,480
Are you alright?

44
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Yes.

45
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,120
Thank you, Shi Luo.

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,840
I am here for somebody's request.

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
Qi Zhan told me

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,880
you're going to do live streaming until late today.

49
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
So he asked me to take a look.

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,560
And I happened to

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,400
encounter you.

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
Ruan Zhi

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,040
Although we are alumni

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
we don't literally

55
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,520
have intersection in school.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
I don't know how Qi Zhan

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
introduced me to you.

58
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Um.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,400
In fact, Qi Zhan and I

60
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,360
have known each other for a long time.

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,960
Probably longer than you all.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,080
Shi Luo.

63
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't get me wrong.

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
Qi Zhan and I have nothing going on.

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,720
That so?

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
That's a shame.

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,640
I like your as a niece.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
I have 5 sisters.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,520
Qi Zhan's mother is my third sister.

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm his little aunt.

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,280
This brat.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,640
Call me by my name all the time.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,320
Gotta educate him.

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,080
Right.

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
He's been calling people by random names

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,160
since college.

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,280
Nothing has changed.

79
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah.

80
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,640
This brat.

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Ugh.

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,840
He won't let anyone know that

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,200
he has a little aunt who is a few months older than him.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,400
He is the type that

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,400
does bad at expressing.

86
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,040
and hates people for interfering in his affairs.

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
That's why he was misunderstood by you

88
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
back in college.

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,160
Do you not believe it?

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
I'll prove it to you.

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Nephew.

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
Am I your mother's

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,400
sister?

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,280
Come on.

95
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
Call me auntie!

96
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,600
Drink your beer.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,760
Um.

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,480
Ay.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,080
Come.

100
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
Qi Zhan.

101
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Qi Zhan.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,960
Qi Zhan is

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,600
hard on mouth.

104
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,320
When he was in the U.S..

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,840
He missed you all day.

106
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,880
Every time I asked him

107
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,520
to text you

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,840
he said

109
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,640
he didn't want to disturb you.

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Ugh.

111
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
He is

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
not only stubborn

113
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
but also bad temper.

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,960
One time

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,320
hey.

116
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:19,880
Hey.

117
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
I accidentally broke his phone.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
I'm sorry

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
I didn't mean to.

120
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,960
The phone is worn out anyway.

121
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
I've been wanting to buy you a new one.

122
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
Don't be sad.

123
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,880
A new one.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,080
Do you know how important it is to me?

125
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,640
Are you OK Darkminded Zhi

126
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,400
How come you can buy it?

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,600
He fiddled all night

128
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,040
to export a few files

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,960
from iTunes.

130
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,760
I was wondering how important.

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
Turned out to be a ringtone.

132
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,080
Hmm right.

133
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
That's the one he's using now.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,640
Um.

135
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,560
Would you like to go to the U.S. with me?

136
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,360
I will help you.

137
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,920
Do I still have the need to go?

138
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
Someone is looking for you.

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,960
Um.

140
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,800
You looking for me?

141
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,280
Yep.

142
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,520
We can talk while walking.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Hey.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,480
Qi Zhan knows you like dubbing.

145
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
He worked hard for you to get an invitation

146
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,240
from the Hollywood Dubbing Masterclass.

147
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,160
He wanted to surprise you

148
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,280
with that invitaion.

149
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,000
But who knows.

150
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,160
Procedures were going wrong in the U.S.

151
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,520
He had to deal with it first.

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,240
Are you alright?

153
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Oops.

154
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
Qi Zhan.

155
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I have never seen you in such a hurry since childhood.

156
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,400
How efficient of you!

157
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,120
Thank god you arrived in time, Shi Luo.

158
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
He was following you into the neighborhood.

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Did you call the police?

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,400
Didn't make it.

161
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,880
The man ran away as soon as I turned on the headlights.

162
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,960
We didn't even see what he looked like.

163
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,760
This won't work.

164
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
It's too dangerous.

165
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,520
Ruan Zhi

166
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,880
you need to move.

167
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,680
These criminals have a high rate of repeating offenses.

168
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,480
Besides, your neighborhood is too old.

169
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
Let along the lack of surveillance and access control.

170
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
Too many insecurities.

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,240
What do you say?

172
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,760
Come.

173
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
Ruan Chi, have some bread.

174
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,960
Um.

175
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,600
Actually, Ruan Zhi.

176
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,560
I agree that your neighborhood is rather old

177
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
and

178
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,360
seems to be quite complicated in residence structure.

179
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
Lots of tenants?

180
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,160
Yep.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
Really unsafe

182
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,800
for a single girl to live.

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
I was planning

184
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,640
to change a residence when the contract ends.

185
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,320
For

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,560
this poor network in neighbourhood

187
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,160
was affecting my live streaming.

188
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Yet

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,320
I have been searching for so long near the company

190
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,880
haven't find one suitable.

191
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
What a coincidence!

192
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,080
I happen to have a relative who is renting apartments.

193
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,360
Plus

194
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,200
it's a high-end community

195
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
just near your company.

196
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I will help you with the contact.

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:36,880
Yeah.

198
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,480
I knew it.

199
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
You have nothing good for me.

200
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm exhausted.

201
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,080
And it's raining!

202
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,600
But to be honest

203
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,880
that apartment is spacious

204
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,800
and beautifully decorated

205
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,000
with such low rent.

206
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Haha.

207
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,800
Hey.

208
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,280
I heard it belongs to your relative.

209
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
Can you ask for me if there are any more?

210
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,480
This kind of lottory can only be took once.

211
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,800
Alright.

212
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,880
You have to treat me a nice meal though.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Sure!

214
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,040
Okay.

215
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,280
Let's go.

216
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,000
Hey.

217
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
Why are here full of jelly?

218
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,200
Do you like them?

219
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
I heard you like those.

220
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,640
Why did you

221
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,600
buy so much jelly?

222
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,840
That's a surprise for her.

223
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,520
How is it?

224
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,160
Does she like them?

225
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,920
Yes.

226
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,600
Hey, keep it a secret.

227
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,320
As long as you don't have a problem coming up

228
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,880
I can guarantee you

229
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,320
everything will be fine.

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Rest assured.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,160
I'll count the time.

232
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
She won't find out.

233
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Okay okay.

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,680
I can only help you here.

235
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
But nephew

236
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080
if you are living so close and

237
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,680
still can't get it done

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,600
I will look down on you.

239
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,120
How many times have I said

240
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,200
call me Qi Zhan.

241
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Hi.

242
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,240
Hi.

243
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,640
Let's go.

244
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,000
Um

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,480
for you.

246
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,760
What?

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,680
It's a sandwich.

248
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,800
I made it.

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you.

250
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
Thank you for the apartment.

251
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,320
Lin Shiluo told you that?

252
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,240
No.

253
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,320
I figured it.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Ruan Zhi

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,360
I don't mean anything by that.

256
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,320
I hope you live safe.

257
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,480
If you don't like it

258
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,240
I can find others.

259
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I like it very much.

260
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,560
I like the jelly too.

261
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,440
How do you know?

262
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
But

263
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
I need to make clear with you.

264
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,240
Thank you so much for renting me such a nice apartment.

265
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,480
But I know the rent

266
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,120
is far below market price.

267
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,120
I am ashamed

268
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,000
and cannot live comfortably.

269
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,800
As for that

270
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,520
begins next month

271
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,880
I wish to pay rent at market price.

272
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,760
Is it okay?

273
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,760
Okay.

274
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,480
It's up to you.

275
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,240
Um.

276
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
Something else?

277
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,240
I think there is something

278
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
that I should tell you.

279
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,800
I know about the Master Class.

280
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,560
Shi Luo already told me.

281
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,920
I can expect that.

282
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,480
Back then

283
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
I was too impulsive.

284
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Actually

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,560
before you came to me that day

286
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
I went to you.

287
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,320
Isn't is funny?

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,440
When I heard you saying that you are going to the U.S. together

289
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,440
I thought you...

290
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,880
Anyways, it's over.

291
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,680
Um.

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Qi Zhan

293
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,040
thank you so much for

294
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,760
helping me along the way.

295
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,680
This is why

296
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,240
you rejected me.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,880
It's past.

298
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,120
It's my fault.

299
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,240
It was my unable to communicate

300
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,200
that resulted in misunderstanding your relationship with Mo Ruyu.

301
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
Me and ruyu?

302
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,360
We are just good friends.

303
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,880
I know.

304
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,240
Um.

305
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,320
Made clear with everything.

306
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,920
I'm relieved.

307
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,200
Ruan.

308
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
I once thought

309
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,120
when and where to tell matters.

310
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I used to want to prepare everything

311
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,080
before actually doing it.

312
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,440
But in fact

313
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,520
the only thing that matters is you.

314
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
Are you still willing to accept me?

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,360
Hey

316
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,280
Mr. Lilan.

317
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,200
The batch of equipment you required has arrived.

318
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,920
Is it convenient for you to come tomorrow afternoon?

319
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Lilan.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,840
Do you have time tomorrow?

321
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,560
I have something to tell you face to face.

322
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
So

323
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,000
Is Lilan the one who made you hesitate?

324
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,200
Are you still willing to accept me?

325
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,560
I..

326
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,200
I am sorry.

327
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,120
Ruan

328
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,840
what is concerning you?

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,200
Qi Zhan

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,920
We are not who we used to be.

331
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
A lot things happened

332
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
during these two years.

333
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,480
About people

334
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,480
about feelings...

335
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,200
I haven't figured out how to deal with them yet.

336
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,960
Please give me some time

337
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,760
so I can determine my mind.

338
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Sorry Zhi.

339
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm out of town recently.

340
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,160
Out of town?

341
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Hello, Miss Lin.

342
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,360
Hey.

343
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
Ruan Zhi, are you busy?

344
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Oh

345
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm not.

346
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,040
Is there something wrong with the dubbing?

347
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,040
No.

348
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,040
It's something else.

349
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,080
I was hoping you can do me a favor.

350
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,640
Ah

351
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,800
please, Ms. Lin.

352
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,800
This matter

353
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,720
I hope you can keep it a secret.

354
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
Come to the company when you are free

355
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
okay?

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,200
Um.

357
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,440
Ruan Zhi

358
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,920
About the theme song

359
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Bai Lu wanted to sing for herself.

360
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,160
But she damaged her vocal cords accidentally

361
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
and cannot make a sound.

362
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,360
The deadline is close

363
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,680
and we have to do this.

364
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,640
Your voice is almost the same as Bai Lu.

365
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,640
Do not worry.

366
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,480
We just need you to record on the weekend

367
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,920
and this will never affect your work.

368
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,920
You don't have to worry about remuneration

369
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,640
it will be the top in the industry.

370
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,360
Only one thing

371
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,600
this is absolutely confidential.

372
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,080
Your have a

373
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,040
great vision.

374
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,520
If it were for you

375
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,160
we would never purchase such advanced equipment.

376
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,080
I can say

377
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,200
this equipment

378
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,480
you can't find the second set in Guangdong.

379
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
In the pursuit of high-quality recording

380
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
equipment is essential.

381
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,320
Then

382
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,680
if no problem

383
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
we can sign the contract.

384
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,880
Okay.

385
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,360
Miss Lin.

386
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Ruan Zhi, here you come.

387
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm here to record.

388
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,320
Please check the contract information

389
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,960
I'll deal with other things first.

390
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,280
Oh.

391
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,680
Okay.

392
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
how are you preparing?

393
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,120
Well, just some details

394
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,560
need to confirm with you.

395
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,360
Miss Lin

396
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
the equipment ordered by Mr. Lilan

397
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,240
is done.

398
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,120
Great.

399
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,800
Mr. Lilan is here?

400
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,200
Yep.

401
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,120
Oh, excuse me.

402
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,560
Okay.

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,120
Lilan, are you back?

404
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,560
I happened to be recording at Sunny Day today.

405
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
I heard you are here too?

406
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,680

408
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,000
Zhi.

409
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,120
I am here.

410
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Are you in the recording studio on the second floor?

411
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm coming for you.

412
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,680
Oh.

413
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,320
Zhi.

414
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm leaving, I'm in a hurry.

415
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,560
Why suddenly hung up?

416
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Ouch, son, are you alright?

417
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,200
It's okay auntie

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,680
this place is so clean.

419
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,120
Right

420
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
why am I afraid of her?

421
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,760
What's happening?

422
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,880
Why is Qi Zhan here?

423
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
Why are you hiding here?

424
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
I...

425
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,560
Hey, hey!

426
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,720
Qi Zhan, let me go!

427
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,920
What are you doing here?

428
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,960
Uh

429
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,600
I...

430
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,520
Oh

431
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,160
Lilan came.

432
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,080
I'm looking for him.

433
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,680
Do you know?

434
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
I've been looking for him for a while.

435
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
I'll give him a call.

436
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,320
Hey!

437
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,200
Hmm...

438
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,920
I have a meeting coming up.

439
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,560
I'll...

440
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,960
I'll go first.

441
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
What?

442
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,560
Okay.

443
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,320
Bye.

444
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm leaving too.

445
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,200
He is in Shenzhen

446
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,040
but told me out of town.

447
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
Is he avoiding me?

448
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,600
But why?

449
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,840
Something should be made clear.

450
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,520
Ruan

451
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,800
Yes

452
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:46,960
What's going on?

453
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,400
You didn't sleep well last night?

454
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,880
Um

455
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,920
Are you going outside?

456
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
It's a nice day today.

457
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,360
How about going for a walk?

458
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I'm sorry,but I have to meet someone.

459
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,240
Zhi?

460
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,920
Yep.

461
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,240
You will meet her?

462
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,520
What you say is...

463
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,520
What's the matter?

464
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Can't date with me?

465
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,320
I have something to talk with Ruyu.

466
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,120
Need to talk?

467
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,360
Do you even worry about that, Qi?

468
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,400
Well, have a nice conversation.

469
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,680
Ruan

470
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,960
If it ends late today,

471
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,320
I will pick you up.

472
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,840
Sure.

473
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,600
See you later.

474
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,760
See you.

475
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,960
Shanzhi

476
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,240
Ok.

477
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Um

478
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,160
Everyone is here.

479
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,960
Let's begin.

480
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,760
Sure.

481
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,360
How about Tao?

482
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
She has gone to deal with site problems.

483
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,520
discuss the choice

484
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,240
of moderator.

485
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, I think

486
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,400
it's so easy.

487
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Zhi has the most followers in live broadcasting room and

488
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
There is no problem with field control or cue process.

489
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,640
So I suggest that

490
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
Zhi could be the host.

491
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:57,960
How's it going?

492
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,560
Sure. Nice.

493
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,080
Agree.

494
00:27:59,640 --> 00:27:59,960
Zhi,

495
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,520
If you wanna a partner,

496
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
in front of you,

497
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,400
there is a perfect fit.

498
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,280
Are you sure that you have time topractise with meyour programme is so complicated,

499
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,520
in the case your programme is so complicated?

500
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,920
Well

501
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,880
Ha ha ha!

502
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,080
Uh-huh

503
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,360
Fine, that's settled then.

504
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,280
Zhi

505
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,560
This time it's hard for you.

506
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,400
By the way,

507
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,520
How about Mr.Lilan?

508
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
What program did he prepare?

509
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,680
About Mr.Lilan,

510
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,760
I haven't asked him yet.

511
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Didn't you say that

512
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,960
you wanna design a special appearance

513
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,000
for Mr.Lilan before?

514
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,920
Ah

515
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,240
Yep

516
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
You are right.

517
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,920
Uh

518
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,960
Because this is the return singing party

519
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,680
for our Xinyin club,after all

520
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,560
I wanna make it special

521
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,680
Although Mr.Lilan is not our member,

522
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,640
He will

523
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,760
definitely bring a lot of heat

524
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,800
for the singing party.

525
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Definitely right.

526
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,280
And we design

527
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,400
a special show by that time

528
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,000
The heat is sure to burst.

529
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,200
It's my treat today.

530
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,520
Order whatever you want.

531
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,800
Really?

532
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,120
Of course!

533
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,000
For real?

534
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,840
For real!

535
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,920
Waiter

536
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
Zhi

537
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,960
Did you hear

538
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,240
Bailu's new song?

539
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Not yet.

540
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,680
Wow

541
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,240
I guess Bailu must be

542
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,760
getting more popular than before

543
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
Even the television drama doesn't play on TV,

544
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,080
the theme song is already

545
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,400
popular.

546
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,400
Wow

547
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
it's prevailed in Tiktok

548
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
Uh

549
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,680
However,

550
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,000
I found that her voice sounds

551
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,680
more and more like you.

552
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,920
I think not.

553
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,240
Maybe

554
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,080
you listen to my voice too many times lately.

555
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
I go to the studio first.

556
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,280
Ok

557
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh Sure

558
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,680
Thank you, Mr.Qi.

559
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,680
Mr. Yan

560
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,280
Yep

561
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Where is Ruanzhi?

562
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,440
Well,she went to the studio.

563
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Hasn't she come back yet?

564
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,760
What's the matter, Mr.Qi

565
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,640
For almost a whole day,

566
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,640
Ruan Zhi didn't come back from the studio.

567
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,400
Well

568
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
uh,she went home after recording the sound.

569
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,120
at more than three.

570
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,000
Well.

571
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,080
She seems to be busy today.

572
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,200
She is engaged in live broadcast preheating for Xinyin singing party.

573
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,600
She asked me for leave before.

574
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,240
Ha ha ha

575
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,760
Mr. Qi

576
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,440
Are you looking for ah Zhi? What's the matter?

577
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,520
Uh

578
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,560
Uh... Ha ha ha

579
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,000
Nothing much. I'll go first.

580
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
Ha ha ha

581
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,240
Thank you for the three guests.

582
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,400
Sweeties,

you'd better end live broadcast.

Bullet screen comments were completely controlled by these Internet Marketers.

They are clearly prepared.

653
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,440
I can't end it now.

00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,560
A clean hand wants no washing.

655
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,920
If I end live broadcast now,

656
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,400
that means I will throw MYself into confusion.

657
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,520
So I will keep living broadcasting.
