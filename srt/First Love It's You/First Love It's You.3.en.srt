1
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,320
Mr.Lilan

2
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
See you tonight at 8 in live

3
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
Okay

4
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
See you at 8

5
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,040
Mr.Qi excuse me

6
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,280
Sorry I didn't knock the door This is quiet regent

7
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
It's okay

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,640
What's wrong

9
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,400
Oh

10
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,320
Um

11
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,920
We already sent the dubbing material to Bailu's team

12
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,840
But

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,760
We haven't received any feedback yet

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,120
So Mr.Yan wanted me to come here

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,200
And ask for your opinion

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
Let's go eat together

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
We can talk about it over lunch

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,120
No thanks I'll come back again in the afternoon

19
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Zhi

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Let's have lunch together later

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Um

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Mr.Qi

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Now I think we should talk about this over lunch

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
You like steak right

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,000
Thanks Mr.Qi

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can do it myself

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,080
It's not working hours

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,160
So don't call me Mr.Qi

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
Then what do I call you

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
QiZhan

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
I think it's totally fine

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,280
You used to call me that

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,080
But that was then and this is now

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Now I'm just an employee

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
And you are my boss

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,600
Ruanruan

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,840
Actually

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,720
I don't know

39
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
What's going on in your mind

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
And I don't want to interfere either

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
But I think

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,040
You should be focusing on

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,360
Things that you should focus on

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
For example

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
LinShiluo

46
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,600
Ruanruan

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,960
Zhi

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,080
What's happened

49
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Are you home yet

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,480
You sure you don't want to try and convince her again

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,920
Maybe she would want to come with us

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,800
She might have her own reason to stay

53
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
So

54
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,360
You weren't dating during these two years

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,240
That doesn't matter

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
This time

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm not going to let go

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,720
Hi Mr.Lilan

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
What's wrong Zhi

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Oh

61
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,000
I fell asleep just now

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Alright

63
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
It's already past 8 and you didn't start your live

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
I thought something happened

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,280
Oh

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,040
No I'm alright

67
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
I didn't notice the time

68
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Oh right

69
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Actually there is something

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,280
Uh huh

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,600
What is it

72
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,360
Mr.Lilan

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,920
We are going to

74
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Run an online come-back show

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,240
And I want to invite you to come

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,800
Ruyu invited you before

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,680
And you said no

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
But I want to ask you again

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,920
I know this might sound bazaar

80
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,360
But I still wanna give it a try

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
I'll go

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Is that a yes

83
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Sure no problem

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
But why did you say no

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
To Mo's invitation

86
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Nothing

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,720
I just don't like him

88
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,480
Now you are the one that's asking me

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,800
Of course I'll say yes

90
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,040
Mo would be sad if he heard this

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,720
So do you feel happier now

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Actually

93
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm not sad

94
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm just

95
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
Confused

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
So many things are going on lately

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,800
And

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
It feels like I'm not able to handle all of them

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
For example

100
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
Mr

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,680
Do you remember

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,560
The friend of mine

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,680
Whose voice sounds a lot like you

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,840
He's back

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,840
It feels a bit familiar

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
But to me it's more strange

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Also with Moruyu

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
I always think of him as a friend

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,920
And now I don't know

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,000
How to be around him

111
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
He confessed to you

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
How do you know

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
I could tell from your tone

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Most of the time

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,160
You can't solve a problem by avoiding it

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
If you could be brave

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,160
There might be some new possibilities waiting for you

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,840
You're right

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,720
I should stop thinking about it

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,040
And try to complete the one million fans task

121
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Then I could open up my own studio and be away from them

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
That'll solve everything

123
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,920
You are amazing

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,400
You really inspired me

125
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
RuanZhi that's...

126
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
That's not what I mean

127
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
Okay Mr I'm ready

128
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,040
Just one second

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,400
I'll be able to start the live show

130
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,920
Hello

131
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
Can you guys see me

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm back today

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Also

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,600
Together with me

135
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
There is a secret guest

136
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,600
That is

137
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Mr.Lilan

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's welcome him

139
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,720
OK
Okay

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's start live with him

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
Hello everyone

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm Lilan

143
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,600
Mr.Lilan is here

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Welcome

145
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,600
So many real time comments

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
Let's see

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,240
What do you want us to dub today

148
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
spongeBob SquarePants

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
Is that okay with you Mr.Lilan

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,960
Okay no problem

151
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,600
Alright

152
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,960
Let's get started

153
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Hey SpongeBob

154
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Let's go catch some jellyfish

155
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Sorry Patrick

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
I'm going to school today

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,560
I can't go with you

158
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,600
If you are going to school today

159
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,360
Then what should I do

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,920
I don't know

161
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,400
What do you usually do

162
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
When I go to school

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Waiting for you to come back

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
Mr.Yan

165
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Ah ah ahh

166
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Zhi

167
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,480
Mr.Yan It's so difficult

168
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Ahh

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,280
I'm so tired

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
What's in the comments

171
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,360
Let's see

172
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
'Cute Zhi'said

173
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,960
'I want to hear you reading Chengyaojin's line'

174
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
'With Ali's voice'

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,040
Wow

176
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,160
I didn't think that pretty girls like you

177
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
Would be into this

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,920
Let me think about it

179
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,400
Chengyaojin's line

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
'Human'

181
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
'Needed a strong body'

182
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,920
'Muscle and soul'

183
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Okay that's it for today

184
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
See you

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,360
Yes

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,360
You really scared me

187
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,600
I need water

188
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,560
Fubute Ubcabtaten

189
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Zhi

190
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
That's cheating

191
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,960
I already said Fubute Ubcabtaten

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
Ruanzhi

193
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,440
Do you have to avoid me

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
I know it's almost impossible

195
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,560
But I still wanted to give it a shot

196
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,400
I didn't know that this would bother you so much

197
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry

198
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,120
Don't say that

199
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,640
Mo

200
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,320
I'm honored

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,720
And surprised

202
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,880
That you liked you

203
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,800
But

204
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
I really don't

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Don't have feelings for me

206
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,120
It's not that hard to say it out after all

207
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
I don't mean to bother you

208
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,920
And I don't want you to feel so confused

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,400
If you're stressed out

210
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
About what I said

211
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,280
Then I hope you could just forget about it

212
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,760
Mo you're really nice

213
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
You don't have to apologize

214
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,360
I've been thinking lately

215
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,760
Instead of you avoiding me

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,880
And drifting apart from me

217
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,360
It's better

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
that we go back to being friends

219
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,400
So you don't need to feel stressed

220
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,040
Really

221
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Do you really want to be friends with me again

222
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,640
Of course

223
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,760
Otherwise it's too much to lose

224
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,600
Thanks so much Mo

225
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,040
I mean it

226
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm so happy to see that

227
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,880
You don't want to see him either

228
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
I feel like that

229
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,360
Good morning Mr.Qi

230
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,400
RuanZhi

231
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,160
My office please

232
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,200
I made a mistake

233
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
I made a huge mistake

234
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
I shouldn't have came to work

235
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
If I didn't come to work

236
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,760
I wouldn't have met QiZhan

237
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,600
If I didn't meet QiZhan

238
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,160
I wouldn't have ended up in here like this

239
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,440
Here

240
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,360
This is for you

241
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,640
What's this

242
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,680
A present

243
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,560
It's for you

244
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,800
Sorry Mr.Qi

245
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,120
Please take it back

246
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
I don't think I should take it

247
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,120
The dubbing you did for Bailu

248
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,400
They received it

249
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
And they were really satisfied

250
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,680
So This is a prize for you

251
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,400
You sure you don't want a prize

252
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,840
What are you doing

253
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
I've got a boyfriend

254
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,800
MoRuyu

255
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,160
Of course not

256
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,400
I've been dating for a long time

257
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,560
That's also why

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,840
I turned Ruyu down

259
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,400
Who is it

260
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,200
It's

261
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Mr.Lilan

262
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,800
What's wrong

263
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,240
Taotao

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,840
I'm done

265
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,520
Here's what happened

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,640
So QIZhan said that since we all know each other

267
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
How about we have dinner together

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,320
We're all coworkers

269
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
He's been working with us for some time

270
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,960
But we've never met and partied

271
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
Since I'm his girlfriend

272
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
He wouldn't refuse

273
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
Now what should I do

274
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm not sure whether he would say yes or not

275
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,720
Humph

276
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,200
You're not a real friend

277
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,160
You're not helping and you're making fun of me

278
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
It's okay

279
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Just ask him out

280
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,240
Should I

281
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Come here

282
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,920
Nobody

283
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,040
Has even seen him in person

284
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,960
You just ask a random guy

285
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,480
To go as Mr.Lilan

286
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,720
Oh

287
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,480
Smart

288
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,400
Right

289
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,400
Hello

290
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,200
Are you free tomorrow

291
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,280
Okay

292
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,440
See you tomorrow

293
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,080
I'm sorry

294
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,880
for asking you out in such a hurry.

295
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,440
It's okay.

296
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,440
To my surprise

297
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,600
Miss Ruan

298
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,520
looks much prettier

299
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,520
than I imagined.

300
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I'm glad I came.

301
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,920
But

302
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,800
Miss Yuan.

303
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,600
Don't blame me for

304
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,440
stating this directly.

305
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
I want to be honest

306
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
with you.

307
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,880
You must know

308
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,520
that I have better options

309
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,280
with my conditions.

310
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,880
Is that so?

311
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,600
Actually

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,280
I was hesitanting

313
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
when you asked me out yesterday.

314
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
If it weren't for my mom's request

315
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,520
urging me to come.

316
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,880
I don't think I'll come.

317
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,000
I heard that

318
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Miss Ruan

319
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is an internet celebrity?

320
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Yep.

321
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,880
That definitely won't work.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,440
You are not young anymore.

323
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,480
Making a living with your appearance

324
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,120
is not acceptable

325
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,440
in our family.

326
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,320
Also my mom said that

327
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
women don't need to go out to work.

328
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,720
Your job is to do chores at home

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
take care of the elderly

330
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,440
and bring up the children.

331
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
You can learn some fine art

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
if you want to.

333
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,040
Current career plans are okay

334
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
as interest for Miss Ruan

335
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
but there's no need to make a living out of it.

336
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:18,840
Umm..

337
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,840
I'm sure

338
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,040
there is misunderstanding between us.

339
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,560
And about after marriage

340
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,320
Ugh

341
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,880
I personally agree

342
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,160
that we as couple need time together.

343
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,840
But my mom is too old

344
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,600
for me

345
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,400
to let her live alone.

346
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,440
if my mom is living with us

347
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,160
she can also help you.

348
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,040
But you can't expect her to help you with the kids.

349
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,280
After all, that's our own business.

350
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
We young people should honor our parents.

351
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,840
You are the one to raise children.

352
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,440
Ah.

353
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,040
Mr Ni

354
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,160
I think

355
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,600
you are taking this too far.

356
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,600
Not that far, Miss ruan.

357
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,720
Actually I don't have to say these.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,840
But

359
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,600
for your sake

360
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
youth is too short to live.

361
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,000
You have to know that

362
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,880
women over 30

363
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,560
are leftover.

364
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
They are worthless by then.

365
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,160
You know, Miss Ruan, you are not young.

366
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,000
with my conditions.

367
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,880
I can still find better woman.

368
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,480
The leftover...

369
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,000
Worthless...

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,280
Judging women by their age...

371
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
Are you from a primitive society?

372
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,000
Who is he?

373
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm Ruan Zhi's boyfriend.

374
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,000
My mom was right

375
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,120
You internet celebrities

376
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,280
have character flaws.

377
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Having a boyfriend and still go out on a blind date.

378
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,560
You are too much.

379
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
You are a pure liar.

380
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
Watch your mouth.

381
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
Does my occupation have anything to do with you?

382
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,000
Mr Ni

383
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,880
You like to look at people with tinted glasses.

384
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,440
Why don't you look in the mirror before going out

385
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,880
to see if you are worthy?

386
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm really grateful that

387
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,680
you look down on me.

388
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,720
No.

389
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,040
I am very grateful that

390
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,400
your whole family despise me.

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
Because it is insulting to be

392
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,160
endorsed by you.

393
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,640
You..

394
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm not finished.

395
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
First

396
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,080
No job is noble or humble.

397
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,520
Men make a living with their own skill.

398
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,320
Secend

399
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,000
Gender equals.

400
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,840
If you just want to be a giant baby

401
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,000
that cannot be separated from his mom

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,080
then I wish

403
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,640
at least your mom has taught you

404
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,880
what is respect.

405
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,600
I've settled the bill.

406
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,760
Let's go.

407
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,200
You!

408
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,400
Right.

409
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,080
Cut the sign

410
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
when you wear a suit next time.

411
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
It's Armani

412
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,960
not Armoni.

413
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,400
Ugh..

414
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,840
Qi Zhan.

415
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,200
Yes?

416
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm sorry

417
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,200
for lying to you.

418
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,760
I know.

419
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,760
He is not Lilan.

420
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,600
No.

421
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
Lilan

422
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,840
is definitely not like this.

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,880
Hey

424
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,720
I didn't mean to lie to you.

425
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,400
Yes

426
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,200
The whole thing about

427
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
Lilan being my boyfriend

428
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,320
is made up by me.

429
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,160
So I cannot ask him

430
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
to pretend to be my boyfriend.

431
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,600
My mom just happened to

432
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,080
arrange me with a blind date

433
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
so I went with it.

434
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,320
Tried to use him to make up for it.

435
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,960
So

436
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,960
You'd rather have a blind date with this idiot

437
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,760
than give a though about me?

438
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes!

439
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,080
If it weren't for you

440
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
how am I having a blind date with this idiot?

441
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
how am I humiliated

442
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,160
to the ground

443
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,080
and blamed by you

444
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,400
who started all these?

445
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,440
Yes

446
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,280
I lied to you.

447
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,960
But if it weren't for you

448
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,280
with Lin Shiluo by your side

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,320
yet still telling me

450
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,000
strange words

451
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,400
and doing strange things to me.

452
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,840
I won't make all the plans

453
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,600
just to avoid you.

454
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,880
You hate me this much?

455
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,320
Right

456
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,160
I really hate you.

457
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
I hate your arrogance

458
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
hate your self righteousness

459
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
I hate you just come

460
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,600
and go.

461
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
Two years ago you

462
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,840
went abroad with Lin Shiluo.

463
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
Why did you come back quitely?

464
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
Why are you doing these vague meaning thing

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
all the time?

466
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,840
I don't know what you're thinking

467
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
and I don't want to know.

468
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
But your actions are really

469
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,960
upsetting me.

470
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,200
I hate this feeling.

471
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,440
Ruan.

472
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
I have liked you for so long.

473
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,200
Do you know?

474
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,600
Hey.

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Hello nephew

476
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,400
What are you doing?

477
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,080
Lin Shiluo

478
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,880
How many times have I said

479
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
don't call me that.

480
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,200
Is this how you talk to elders?

481
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,080
I went home two days ago.

482
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,200
Your mom asked me to bring you something.

483
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,640
how do I give you?

484
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,840
I will go to Beijing tomorrow night.

485
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,360
How about this

486
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,800
you come to our company at tomorrow noon.

487
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,320
Listen.

488
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,760
You have to be careful during commuting.

489
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,320
Yes.

490
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
Especially your girls

491
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,400
It's so dangerous.

492
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,120
Yes, Yan.

493
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,200
We'll take note.

494
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,040
Yan

495
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,200
what happened?

496
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,760
Zhi

497
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
you haven't heard of it?

498
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,480
Ah..

499
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,680
there have been accidents.

500
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
What's up?

501
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,960
A stalker has been active recently.

502
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,080
Yes.

503
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
He picks out the single girl who has left the night shift.

504
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,440
Xiao Wu was almost in trouble yesterday.

505
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,920
Yep.

506
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,960
She was lucky to get off.

507
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
Fortunately, she is all right.

508
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,960
Just scared out of hell.

509
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,040
She already called the police.

510
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,200
Mr. Qi gave her a few days off.

511
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,400
Em.

512
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,120
Zhi

513
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,600
are you listening?

514
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Zhi?

515
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,040
Be careful after work during live streaming.

516
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
Mr. Qi, morning.

517
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,120
Hello Mr. Qi.

518
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,600
On a business trip Mr. Qi?

519
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,600
Let me.

520
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,040
Mr. Qi.

521
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
With Ruan Zhi's ability

522
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm sure it will be fine.

523
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
She is probably busy with live streaming recently.

524
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,760
So the timetable is tight.

525
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,000
Who will do the dubbing of Bai Lu then?

526
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,600
Yes.

527
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,480
you are right.

528
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,640
She cannot get loose on her duty

529
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
even it's for live streaming.

530
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,360
Right?

531
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,760
I'll educate her later.

532
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,920
Time is precious.

533
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,320
Yes, Mr. Qi, let's get started!

534
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:15,800
Chill, chill.

535
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,200
I'll get her.

536
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,320
Ah haha.

537
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
What are you doing?

538
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,520
Hurry up!

539
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,760
You have kept Mr. Qi waiting for the day!

540
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
Hey Yan.

541
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,920
Isn't Mr. Qi going on a business trip today?

542
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,720
Why does he still have time to come for the meeting?

543
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Umm

544
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,640
he is leaving in the afternoon.

545
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,280
Hurry up, stop chattering!

546
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,200
Hurry!

547
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,640
Hey Yan.

548
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,600
my stomach starts to hurt.

549
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,040
Can I..

550
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,040
Stomach hurts?

551
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
Hurt my ass!

552
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,320
Hurry up!

553
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,600
Mr. Qi.

554
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,200
Mr. Qi.

555
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,320
Until now

556
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,160
I want to know why the progress

557
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,520
of "Love Unexpected" is so slow?

558
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,760
Is there any difficulty encountered

559
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,720
during Bai Lu's dubbing?

560
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,480
Ah haha...

561
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,360
That one, Mr. Qi

562
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,040
No problem!

563
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,720
No problem at all!

564
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,320
Mr. Qi

565
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,760
The quality of Zhi's dubbing has always been guaranteed.

566
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
It's just this time

567
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,760
Bai Lu's part is too much..

568
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,320
I don't want excuses.

569
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,000
Finish the first 20 episodes before off work

570
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,920
and sent them to her agent.

571
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
Any questions?

572
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
No problem!

573
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,640
No problem.

574
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
Mr. Qi, it will be delivered on time.

575
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,760
Right, Zhi?

576
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,960
How unprofessional of him!

577
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
It only takes him to move lips

578
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,080
to ask for 20 episodes.

579
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,520
Does he think it is that easy?

580
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Watch me.

581
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
When I have a million fans

582
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,840
my first task

583
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,920
will be drawing the line with him

584
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,840
and leave him forever.

585
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,720
Ay

586
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,480
right.

587
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,080
Your mom asked me to bring you a scarf.

588
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,960
Try it.

589
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,320
Um.

590
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,840
The restaurant of your company

591
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,280
doesn't serve good food.

592
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
I've come all the way to deliver you those things

593
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,160
this is how you treat me?

594
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,600
Doesn't it taste good?

595
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
It's fine to me.

596
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,080
Xiao Mo and Ruan Zhi are here too.

597
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,760
Hello.

598
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,320
Hey.

599
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
That's Mr. Qi's girlfriend?

600
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
They look like a couple.

601
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah.

602
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,720
Mr. Qi himself is handsome

603
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
and his girlfriend is so pretty.

604
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,280
I'm envy.

605
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,200
Um.

606
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,920
I'm full.

607
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,920
Don't you like these?

608
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
You are affecting me.

609
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh right.

610
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,280
The Coming Back Concert

611
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,160
do you have to

612
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,400
have another meeting with Shanzhi？

613
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
You work overtime on live streaming every day.

614
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,960
Can your body take it?

615
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,720
I don't want to either

616
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,040
but

617
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
the internet speed of the neighborhood where I live now

618
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,840
is insane at night.

619
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,920
Can't go live at all.

620
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,280
So I can only do it in the company.

621
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,960
You look like a stepmother.

622
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
No wonder Ruan

623
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
only want to date the new guy

624
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
instead of you.

625
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,080
It's none of your business.

626
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,520
You just have to explain to her

627
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
on that tiny little subject.

628
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,280
You think you are acting in a Korean drama?

629
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,960
Look at you.

630
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,960
Every time I come to this

631
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,720
you don't respond.

632
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,600
If you really can't start explaining

633
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
I can help.

634
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,280
Hey Qi Zhan!

635
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,400
I haven't finished yet!

636
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm full.

637
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,640
Where are you going?

638
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,480
Send dubbing record to Bailu's Company.

639
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
It is a new app.

640
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,280
Click here to download.

641
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,600
Users can sing and game together.

642
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,120
A lot of pretty girls are using it.

643
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,800
This one.

644
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,000
It's downloading.

645
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,640
I heard a new art exhibition opened near here.

646
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,960
Free entrance for now.

647
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,600
Hey

648
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,160
what are you doing?

649
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,840
What?

650
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,720
I just told you and you forget at once.

651
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,760
The girls especially

652
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,960
don't work overtime and off work together.

653
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm telling you

654
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,520
this monster is very perverted.

655
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,760
Oh.

656
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
Didn't Zhi come back?

657
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,760
She should've been going home now.

658
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,480
She has been busy with live streaming recently

659
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
I don't think she will come back.

660
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,320
Yes.

661
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,480
At noon she said

662
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,960
would off work early tonight.

663
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,400
Let's go.

664
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,960
Attention.

665
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,480
I just watched a news

666
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,400
about another pervert at Dongcheng

667
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,160
got caught

668
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,280
with weapons on him.

669
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm already at the door of the company

670
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,200
will be in office soon.

671
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Just a second.

672
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm going up now.

673
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Thank you for the flowers,  nickname 'the Cutest Ruan Zhi'.

674
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,640
Welcome 'Lemon Fairy' to the live room.

675
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,760
I'll be streaming tonight until 10 o'clock.
