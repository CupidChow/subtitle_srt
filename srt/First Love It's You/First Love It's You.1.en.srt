1
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,880
They really push me too far

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Great money, ah your home

3
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
And want to buy out my voice

4
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Why don't they go

5
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
monopolize the whole industry

6
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,760
I'll go to their boss tomorrow

7
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Let the whole apologize

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Whether you are happy or not

9
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,760
I will always be by your side

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
it's wonderful to have you

11
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,600
Your current behavior

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Has seriously hindered the normal operation

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,720
of the studio

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,480
If you don't go

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,920
We will call the police

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Let me take it for you

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,760
Um

18
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,760
It's MoRuyu

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
hi, Ruyu

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,440
Little AZhi

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,720
You're not out yet, are you

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,520
There are Bailu's fans at the door of the company

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,520
Don't come today

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm afraid they'll hurt you

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
All right, hang up first

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,000
i'm not coming

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Miss Ruan

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Let me get this straight

29
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,520
Now there is a lot of noise on the Internet

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,120
Question the similarity between Bailu's original voice and miss Ruan's voice

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,280
This undoubtedly caused us a lot of trouble

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,440
I did set it up for more close to Bailu

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
and imitated her voice

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,480
This is also the crux of the problem

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,800
Miss Ruan, I hope you can think about it again

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
Forget about it

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,120
How much do you need?

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,560
ten million

39
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
This is simply

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
a naked slander

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Bailu didn't even show up yesterday

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
How could there be her voice

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,680
in this recording

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Just stay home and have a rest today

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll go to the company

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,200
Promise me

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,080
No

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,840
Don't watch

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,600
Don't listen

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,080
Um

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,840
TaoTao

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Can you stay at home with RuanZhi

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,520
OK, thank you

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
What are you doing here

55
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,000
What happened to my little nephew's daughter-in-law

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,240
How could I not come

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
You'd better not go up

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,040
What happened?

59
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,880
It's a mess

60
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
That YanZhengyu

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
They've called the police

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,240
I had no sooner arrived

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
than security guard kicked the fans out of here

64
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,640
That's good

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
It seems like I need go to find Bailu again

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll go with you

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
We have business contacts

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,240
with their company

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,840
hey

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
How's RuanZhi

71
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
TaoTao went to accompany her

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
Let her rest for two days

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll get my car first

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,760
Hey, I don't think you're in good state either

75
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Let's take my car

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,200
good

77
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't worry

78
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,000
It's no use worrying now

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,960
There is not a minute to lose

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,120
It must be solved immediately

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,520
Have you made it clear to RuanZhi

82
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,360
The previous misunderstanding has been solved

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
What about childe Lilan

84
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,640
Not yet

85
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,960
Why?

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,920
I have a good relationship with her now

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
But I never had a chance

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
Make it clear to her

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,000
QiZhan

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,480
It's a kind of deception

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
for girls

92
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Instead of being found out by her

93
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
You might as well tell her by yourself

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,040
Although your intention is good

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
But girls

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,720
They will enlarge infinitely at the point of deception

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
Just listen to me and make it clear to her

98
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
Let's not talk about this first

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,880
The priority is to help her out

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,240
oh

101
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,160
Hey, I finally found you

102
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
I went to your house but I didn't find you

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm glad you're here

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Or I'll call the police

105
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Ah, all right

106
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,680
Stop crying

107
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,520
Stop crying, stop crying

108
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,520
Stop crying, stop crying

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,640
There's something I've been thinking about all the way

110
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,600
But I decided to tell you

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,840
IDLook at these IDs

112
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,320
Reach for the moon

113
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
Old trousers

114
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
eight-three-five-six-seven

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
And national orange peel

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
What the hell are these?

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
Are they all the same

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
so

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,880
Those brought shame on me in the studio

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,520
are the same as people in these comments

121
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,160
yes

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,040
that's all

123
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
We have reason to doubt

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,400
those making you look bad in the live studio

125
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,920
And this recording event

126
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
It's definitely someone's long planned plan

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
So we thought about it

128
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,320
For your sake

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,160
still

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,920
It's better to postpone the return of heart sounds to the singing meeting

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,680
All right, all right

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Stop crying

133
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
Stop crying, stop crying

134
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,880
Ah

135
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,960
Not happy yet

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,520
Forget it

137
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
In fact, the heart sound song will be postponed

138
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,760
It also has its advantages

139
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
So you can

140
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
be well prepared

141
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,040
Um

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
also

143
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,680
Bailu's fans are relatively young

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,120
So they'll soon forget it

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
It won't make trouble

146
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,040
ah

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Um

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,680
hey

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
oh dear

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
No, I can't run

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,560
Ah

152
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,080
hey

153
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,560
If you hadn't brought me out today

154
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,880
I can't breathe such good air

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,680
see

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm afraid you're bored at home

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,960
It's been days

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
It should be almost ready

159
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,240
Going through the process

160
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,880
It'll be over in a minute

161
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,000
Although your intention is good

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,440
But girls will cheat on this point

163
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Infinite amplification

164
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,080
Ruan Ruan

165
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,440
Um

166
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,640
There's something I want to tell you

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,360
what

168
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
actually

169
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,600
Mr. Li Lan is

170
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,440
Your cell phone rings

171
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
Why don't you answer

172
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,000
oh

173
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
You just said what happened to Lilan God

174
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,280
nothing

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
Look, it's going to rain

176
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
Let's go back quickly

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,280
Um

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh, it's raining

179
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,800
Ruan Ruan

180
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,360
Um

181
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,160
I have work to do

182
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,240
I won't take you back to your room

183
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,720
Um

184
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,160
Come on

185
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Have a good rest today

186
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,520
OK, I can take care of myself

187
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,440
Go back soon

188
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,000
I forgot to return the clothes to him

189
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,640
The door is not closed

190
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,880
This is your problem

191
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I hope you

192
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,080
give me an accurate answer as soon as possible

193
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,240
also

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,680
this time

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
After dubbing

196
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm going to take some time off

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,600
yes

198
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,280
Total shutdown

199
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,600
Ah Zhi

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
It's nice to be friends with you

201
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm going to leave for a while

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,000
Thank you for your support

203
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,600
I wish you happiness

204
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,240
Ah Zhi

205
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,520
It's nice to be friends with you

206
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm going to leave for a while

207
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Thank you for your support

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,880
I wish you happiness

209
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,720
Don't come here

210
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,320
Ruan Ruan

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,080
Let me explain

212
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,520
Now I should call you Qi Zhan

213
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
Or Mr. Lilan

214
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,040
I didn't mean to lie to you

215
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
It's been two years since I left you

216
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't know how to approach you

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,480
oh

218
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,200
therefore

219
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,560
You just

220
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,880
made up a

221
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,160
Childe Lilan, right

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,800
I use Mr. Lilan

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
because I just want to change my identity to get close to you

224
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
I think you like dubbing so much

225
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm sure you won't refuse

226
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,200
Won't say no to anything

227
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
I won't refuse one

228
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
someone

229
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
who likes to make sure that I'm fine

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,400
Caring

231
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,560
The great God of dubbing, isn't it

232
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,440
That's not the truth

233
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,440
Why didn't you make it clear earlier

234
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,000
See I confessed my feelings for childe Lilan

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,680
You feel proud, don't you

236
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
I

237
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Qi Zhan

238
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
Qi Zhan

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,000
You always have

240
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,560
So many excuses

241
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
So many difficulties

242
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,880
you are going to America

243
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
You're hiding it from me

244
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
You're coming back. You're still hiding it from me

245
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,320
you take the identity of Li Lan

246
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,520
show up in my life for two years

247
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,360
If I hadn't found out this time

248
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
Is that what you're planning on

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
lying to me all my life

250
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
Sorry, Ruan Ruan

251
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,520
I can explain

252
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
You are a selfish liar

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,920
Ruan Ruan

254
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,000
Ruan Ruan

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
Can you listen to me

256
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Ruan Ruan

257
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Open the door

258
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,720
I really didn't mean it

259
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,400
You open the door

260
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,040
Shall we talk face to face

261
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
I'll tell you what you want to know

262
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,360
I didn't mean to lie to you

263
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,920
Ruan Ruan, let's put it a word

264
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Don't scare me, ok

265
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,200
Blame me for lying to you

266
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,520
But I just want to be with you

267
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
Shi Luo

268
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,680
I made an appointment with Bailu

269
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Today, please

270
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,320
Take care of Ruan Zhi for me

271
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,520
She knew everything

272
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,560
You should eat something

273
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,080
Starving is not good for your body

274
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,960
Tell me about it

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
It's because of Bailu

276
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,800
Or because of Qi Zhan

277
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,520
You know

278
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,840
He is the Li Lan

279
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,880
Ruan Zhi, I'm sorry

280
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,040
It's not you who should apologize

281
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,120
He's so worried about you

282
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
that he ask me to see you

283
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
He has gone to Bailu's company now

284
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,560
If he did not care about you

285
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,120
he would not take

286
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,600
this way to get close to you

287
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm angry

288
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,160
He could speak clearly

289
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,280
Why must we use a misunderstanding

290
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
to cover up another misunderstanding

291
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,080
Cover up another lie with another

292
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,800
You're right.

293
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,200
But things in the world

294
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,800
It's not just right or wrong

295
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,120
Isn't this between you two

296
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
The biggest problem

297
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,040
They are too idealistic and stubborn

298
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,920
Ruan Zhi

299
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,840
I actually told him a long time ago

300
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,800
Let him make it clear to you

301
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,360
Now that you decide to come back, face it bravely

302
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
Whatever the outcome

303
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,720
we can have a clear conscience.

304
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,600
But you know his character

305
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,240
He is a private person

306
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,840
Ruan Zhi, look

307
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
Your studio has made a statement

308
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,040
Stop all cooperation with Bailu

309
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,720
Violence against fans and cutting audio out of malice

310
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
shall be investigated for legal responsibility according to law

311
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
actually

312
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
I thought about it all night yesterday

313
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,960
It's really my fault

314
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
I did it for Bailu

315
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,840
It's the truth

316
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
I deceived everyone

317
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,560
I'm always asking people to confess

318
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,120
But I can't do it myself

319
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,240
No negativity, no escape

320
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Don't give up and face it bravely

321
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,840
Shi Luo, you're right

322
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,040
I have an idea

323
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,760
Let me use your phone

324
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,240
Um

325
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,360
here

326
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,440
Hello, Tao Tao

327
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,480
Ruan Zhi

328
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,720
it's me

329
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,480
You tell Shanzhi

330
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,000
Our concert will be held as scheduled

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,640
Ruan Zhi

332
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,360
Ruan Zhi

333
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,360
You talk

334
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
I left early

335
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,720
Sorry, I'm busy

336
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,280
No problem

337
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,440
I can wait

338
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,000
Qi Zhan

339
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Today's concert

340
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,800
It's very important to me

341
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
So what's the matter

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Shall we wait until it's over

343
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,080
hi

344
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,120
Hit a wall

345
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,160
What I asked you to prepare

346
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,800
are you ready?

347
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,640
Yes, of course

348
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,040
Don't you rest assured that I'm a stranger like jade

349
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
But I'm doing this because of ah Zhi

350
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,440
It has nothing to do with you

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,640
thank you

352
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,920
by the way

353
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Don't wear this dress for a while

354
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,280
Ugly

355
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,120
I'm serious, too

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
heart sounds

357
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,160
wow

358
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
hello everyone

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm Ruan Zhi

360
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,000
wow

361
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,400
hello everyone

362
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm Xiaomo

363
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
wow

364
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
Hello, I'm Tao Tao

365
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,640
wow

366
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,400
Hello, everyone. I'm the president of Xinyin

367
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,120
Mountain Branch

368
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,000
wow

369
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,720
So now

370
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,840
Our hearts return to the song Club

371
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,400
It's officially started

372
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
We must do more

373
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
Support your favorite anchor

374
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,000
Our big guest today

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Li Lan childe

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,560
Will also appear in front of everyone

377
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Everybody

378
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
Don't quit the studio

379
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,720
WOW~

380
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,800
Then there's Xiaomo down there

381
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,640
Let's bring you the first program

382
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,160
As always, day after day

383
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,080
It's hard to bear such a day

384
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,560
There is nowhere to escape

385
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,400
Go to sleep

386
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,360
We've always been like this

387
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,040
Tired of such a sleepy night

388
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,800
Still have to keep dancing

389
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,640
Wave goodbye for tomorrow's meeting

390
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
After wandering around, he finally arrived

391
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,600
This should be a paradise

392
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,560
But now I'm not sure

393
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,680
It took a quarter of a century to finally get the result

394
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,600
Pale superstar

395
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Waiting hungry

396
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm a loser

397
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,760
So even if

398
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,720
Bravado doesn't matter, does it

399
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
Move on again

400
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,120
Our voices

401
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,800
Ah Zhi

402
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,200
Great, great

403
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Ah Zhi

404
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,280
Ah Zhi

405
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,920
Great, great

406
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,600
Ah Zhi is great

407
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,120
Like to lean on your back

408
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,760
Smell you

409
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,400
Like to surround your bike

410
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,360
Go back to see the warm sun

411
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm your favorite flower

412
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,560
Quietly open only for you

413
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,200
like

414
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,000
I like looking at the stars with you

415
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,040
This is a crayon Xiaoxin she matched

416
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,720
Huanan City Huanan City

417
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,240
Think about the future

418
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Yes, I can

419
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,280
Sing loudly for you

420
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,600
Like your love

421
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,920
Give me courage

422
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,800
I like to keep you in mind

423
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,360
Imagine every day

424
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,040
Like life, that's it

425
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,720
Even if you're a little stubborn

426
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,040
I like our days with a little sugar

427
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,560
Like your love gives me courage

428
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Ah, what's going on

429
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,000
ah

430
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,480

Thank you very much, too

Would you like to come here and listen to me sing

434
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,120
Listen to me

Xinyin Society

436
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,720
Always carrying me

437
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,680
The initial heart of dubbing

438
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
And dream place

439
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,600
So here I want to tell you

440
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm sorry

441
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,280
I'm sorry I lied to you

442
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
In the past two years

443
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,480
I've been in charge

444
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,360
Miss Bailu includes

445
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,920
But not limited to all film and television works

446
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
And the substitution of musical works

447
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
Her new single just released

448
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll sing for you, too

449
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,040
Sister Lin is in a bad situation

450
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,120
The water army on the Internet is now a lot upside down

451
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,000
Lian Bailu's fans

452
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm also verifying the truth

453
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm sorry

454
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,680
I know because of me

455
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,280
Caused a lot of trouble to everyone

456
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
therefore

457
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,600
I want to tell you

458
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm really sorry

459
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
I Know

460
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
These affect my friends

461
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,040
relatives

462
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm really sorry

463
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
No, sister Lin

464
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
We were ripped off when we did something about the recording

465
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
The biggest station sister on bailu.com

466
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,320
De powdering has been announced

467
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,480
fast

468
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Arrange for Bai Lu to make an apology

469
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,320
It seems to be another beautiful dream

470
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,040
Meet you again at a certain moment

471
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,760
Is it a casual encounter or fate

472
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,360
Close to you

473
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,880
Our meeting was like fate

474
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,520
I looked at the stars in the night sky

475
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,120
Every wish made is for you

476
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,040
So I can hold you in my arms

477
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,200
Oh, oh

478
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,520
Our dreams are happening

479
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,560
Our hearts are moving

480
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,520
We are holding hands

481
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,320
Walk through sweet tenderness together

482
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,640
Watch the sunset together

483
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,960
Laugh, time is wasted

484
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,680
Spend the days missing you

485
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,920
We smiled and said

486
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,360
Go around every corner

487
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,760
We always say this

488
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,800
I will never let go all my life

489
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Let love fall

490
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,400
After the passage of time

491
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,080
Set the time silently

492
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,320
In our love

493
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,960
Set the time silently

494
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,880
In our love

495
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,480
Qi Zhan

496
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh

497
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,920
Boss

498
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,080
hello everyone

499
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm Mr. Lilan

500
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,520
I stand here today

501
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,240
I want to share a story with you

502
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,240
Stories about missing

503
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
Also a

504
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,320
The story of reunion after a long separation

505
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,240
Once there was a

506
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
A stupid boy

507
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,440
Because of ridiculous self-esteem

508
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
And self righteous

509
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,880
Watch him

510
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
The beloved girl

511
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,760
Leave sadly

512
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,800
And remain indifferent

513
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,320
Until I missed it

514
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
Only then did he understand

515
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,800
How naive he is

516
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
How ridiculous

517
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,520
How self righteous

518
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,440
however

519
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,200
But how much I love her

520
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,560
He dared not tell the girl everything

521
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,680
therefore

522
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,760
He chose the stupidest way

523
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,120
Change your identity

524
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,680
Into her life

525
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,840

therefore

543
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,440
You just

544
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,680
Made up a

545
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,920

546
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
See me confess my feelings for childe Lilan

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,880
I didn't want to lie to you from the beginning to now

549
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,880
Ah Zhi

550
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,000
How are you doing

551
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Until this moment

552
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
I have the courage to stand here

553
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,240
Tell you

554
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,520
I

555
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,800
It's Mr. Lilan

556
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,600
But I'm also your Qi Zhan

557
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,240
Because of you

558
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,880
In this world

559
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Will there be the existence of Childe Lilan

560
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,560
It's also because of you

561
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,640
I have the courage

I love you!

566
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,240
Are you willing to forgive that

567
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,000
immature

568
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,640
be opinionated

569
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,440
But deceived you again

570
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640

Fans apologize

574
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,640
I deceived everyone

575
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,400
I also want to apologize to miss Ruan Zhi

576
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Because of my

577
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,760
Greed and narrowness

578
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,360
To miss Ruan Zhi

579
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Extremely negative impact

580
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,720
I am willing to take all responsibility for this

581
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,560
I'm sorry

582
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,240
All right, you're free

583
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,640
