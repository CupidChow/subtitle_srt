1
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,319
Mom.

2
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,198
There's a kid
called Na Il-deung in my class.

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,493
He's super smart and really good-looking.

4
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,706
And he even has a great sense of humor.

5
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:45,754
The other day, I was so surprised
when he randomly asked me to date him.

6
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:51,342
I bet this time too,
he'll be laughing as he says,

7
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:57,515
"Hey. Come on. I'm joking,."
or something like that.

8
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,393
-What--
-Let me know if you're interested.

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,023
There's still a few days left
before the math test.

10
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,044

MERRY-GO-ROUND

15
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,404
I'll pay you. To fail the test.

16
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,698
Don't you

17
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,201
need money?

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,541
It's not as nice as a mama hen
keeping you warm, is it?

19
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,420
But you can still do it,
because you are a very special egg.

20
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,218
Go to bed already.
You're going to be sleepy at school.

21
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,180
I don't have any classes, so it's okay.

22
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,310
The field trip starts tomorrow.

23
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,608
The ones who aren't going
have no class for the day

24
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,695
after taking attendance. It's so awesome.

25
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,281
Why didn't you tell me?

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,117
Because I don't want to go.

27
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,663
You know how I'm sensitive
about some things.

28
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,458
All of the girls in my class
will be sleeping in the same room.

29
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,793
How ridiculous is that?

30
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,087
Imagine how noisy it'll be.

31
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,886
They'll probably stay up all night, right?

32
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,470
Having fun?

33
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,809
What's so fun about that?

34
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,104
It's expensive for nothing.

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,410
Why aren't you going on the field trip?

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,039
I'll pay for it.
Go, even if you don't want to.

37
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,500
You have money?

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,545
Yeah.

39
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,090
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and pack.

40
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,345
Well, if you insist.

41
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,680
Because I'm a good little sister.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,674
I'll do it.

43
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,721
How low do I have to score?

44
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,099
Just keep it under 90.

45
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,274
How much are you going to pay me?

46
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,612
Two hundred thousand won now,
and three hundred more after

47
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
the scores come out.

48
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,330
Okay.

49
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,065
It's okay.

50
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,401
Whatever pride I'm selling
for a few hundred thousand won

51
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,946
can always be bought back
once I make a lot of money later.

52
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,247
Hey.

53
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,542
What are you two doing?

54
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,674
Be honest.

55
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,843
I saw everything.

56
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,396
The two of you…

57
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,363
were holding hands, right?

58
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,783
-What?
-What's going on here?

59
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,952
-Are they dating?
-Are you really dating?

60
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,620
-What?
-Oh my.

61
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,372
-Seriously?
-For real?

62
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,083
-What?
-They're dating.

63
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,501
-Really?
-Hey!

64
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,254
You're supposed to act
like you saw nothing.

65
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,840
-Oh my!
-Il-deung, nice!

66
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,633
No way. For real?

67
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,429
No way.

68
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,597
Really?

69
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,644
I would've never guessed it.

70
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,064
Take one and pass it.

71
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,691
Come on.

72
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,734
Hurry up.

73
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,087
2022 MIDTERM EXAM
SUBJECT: MATH

74
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,516
MIDTERM EXAM

75
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,059
Five minutes left.

76
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,923
YOON AH-YI
ANSWERS FOR THE MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS

77
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,691
Mom, today was the last day of midterms.

78
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:50,279
But I bombed the math exam
I was most confident about.

79
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,990
It wasn't that hard,

80
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,370
but I made a mistake while marking
my answers down on the answer sheet.

81
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,831
Next time,

82
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,169
I won't make the same mistake again.

83
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,547
Okay, here we go!

84
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,305
-Having fun?
-Yeah, this is so much fun.

85
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,071
Let's go find your mom.

86
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,663
-Ah-yi.
-Yes?

87
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,500
If you ever lose Mommy,
make sure you don't wander off.

88
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,796
Come right here,
in front of the merry-go-round.

89
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,673
That's how I can find you?

90
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,674
Yes.

91
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,554
So, no crying,
even if you lose your grip on my hand.

92
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,556
Be brave and strong.

93
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,769
Okay. No crying,
and I'll wait for you right here,

94
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,355
Were you waiting for me?

95
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,692
-No, I wasn't.
-All right.

96
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,035
It's just that

97
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,083
I come here out of habit
when something upsetting happens.

98
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,877
Birthdays, Children's Days…

99
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,382
Every happy memory with my mom
happened in this place.

100
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,929
When you step into an amusement park,

101
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,306
you forget about
all of your worries, right?

102
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,476
That's why I like it here.

103
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,813
-Even to this day?
-Yeah.

104
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,694
Not for me, not anymore.

105
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,031
Maybe it's because
the park is old and rusty now,

106
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,201
or maybe it's because I've grown up.

107
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,042
Let's see.

108
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,548
There's nothing like a merry-go-round
to stop a kid from crying.

109
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,551
What do you say?

110
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,803
Want to go for a ride?

111
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,976
No. Are you going to talk
about all that weird stuff again,

112
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,895
about what real magic is like?

113
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,690
I was just going to turn the ride on.

114
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,195
All I have to do is
flip that switch over there.

115
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,412
Wow.

116
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,459
You know how to do this kind of stuff too?

117
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,336
Of course.

118
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:16,921
Then,

119
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,925
did you fix all the other rides here too?

120
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:27,139
Well, the trick is
knowing exactly what to fix.

121
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,768
Fixing old machines like these
isn't as hard as you'd think,

122
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,394
as long as you know how they work.

123
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,230
But…

124
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,441
you.

125
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,110
In here.

126
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,658
Do you know what to do
when your heart is broken?

127
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,995
What do you have to do?

128
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,206
Just say the magic words.

129
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,291
Like this.

130
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,546
Annara

131
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:00,923
sumanara.

132
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:08,973
Then you'll start to think
about all of the good memories you had.

133
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,142
And you'll think
"Everything will turn out okay for me."

134
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,770
"This kind of pain is nothing."

135
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,607
Just like that.

136
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,778
I'm serious.

137
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,744
Whenever things get really hard,
just trust me and give it a shot.

138
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,040
Okay?

139
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,050
Annara sumanara.

140
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,636
That's right! Just like that!

141
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,727
What do you say?
Do you want to go for a ride?

142
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,167
Annara

143
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,544
sumanara.

144
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,850
Seeing something with your eyes

145
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,437
Doesn't always mean it's true

146
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:44,318
You're only seeing what you believe

147
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,905
Do you remember the brilliant world

148
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:54,286
You used to see when you were a child?

149
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,374
Us, back in those days?

150
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:06,840
I believed in myself more
And could become anything

151
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:13,764
Tomorrow was always
More exciting than today

152
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,017
Even on cloudy days

153
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,853
I would wait for the sun

154
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,983
Holding in my heart

155
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,696
The dreams that would come true one day

156
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,323
In the dark of the night
The only thing that grows

157
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,077
Are the excuses that seem even more
Convincing than they did yesterday

158
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:40,708
I know you're really only trying
To run away

159
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:46,672
Perhaps we could have run down

160
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:50,759
Those same paths

161
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,389
Where we'd once fallen down

162
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:02,855
I can believe in myself again
And can become anything

163
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,236
Tomorrow will always be
More exciting than today

164
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,656
-Beyond those clouds
-The sun's waiting to shine

165
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,368
-I can always remember it
-Remember it

166
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,164
-I can feel
-I can feel

167
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,709
The dreams that will blossom again

168
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,919
Are right here

169
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,048
I'll draw myself on a day as white as snow

170
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,843
With no reasons to back down

171
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:37,097
No reasons to feel small

172
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,768
Again with unwavering light

173
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:47,649
With any and every color I desire

174
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,362
I'll paint myself in

175
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,116
I can believe in myself again

176
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,328
And can become anything

177
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:06,376
Tomorrow will always be
More exciting than today

178
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,005
I met myself again

179
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,342
And I won't let go of that hand

180
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:18,847
My sparkling name calls out to me

181
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,351
-Beyond those clouds
-The sun's waiting to shine

182
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,979
-I can always remember it
-Remember it

183
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,274
I can feel

184
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,028
The dreams that will blossom again

185
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,072
Are within me

186
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,742
In my heart

187
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:45,749
Feel my dream

188
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
How are you feeling?

189
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,791
Do you feel a bit better now?

190
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,878
All right.

191
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:33,922
Yes.

192
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,967
For a moment, at least.

193
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,094
A moment?

194
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,641
Well. How about

195
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,854
you erase those numbers
in your head first?

196
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,274
-Numbers?
-Yes.

197
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,445
Math formulas, test scores,
your ranking, time,

198
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,615
and money.

199
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,078
How am I supposed to do that?

200
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,293
Even if it's only for a moment,
try and do something totally silly.

201
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,961
For example,

202
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,048
learning magic from me.

203
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,927
What do you think?
Wouldn't life be more interesting?

204
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,223
Later.

205
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,099
Maybe later.

206
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,062
No matter how much I think about it,

207
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,523
learning something like magic,
given my current situation,

208
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,275
just doesn't make any sense.

209
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,241
I can't live my life
only doing things that I want to do.

210
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,076
Like you.

211
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,248
Even if it was only
for a short while, thank you.

212
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,257
I'm not saying
you should only do what you want.

213
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,552
You should do
whatever it is you want to do

214
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,514
just as much as
the things you don't want to do.

215
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,040
Goodness.

216
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,878
My students are busy being loud today too.
Some things never change.

217
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,464
All right!

218
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,719
The day you've all been waiting for
has finally arrived!

219
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
I can tell by your faces, you all know.

220
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,557
Yes, you're right. Your report cards!

221
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,142
Come on, man.

222
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,271
You're that excited to see them?

223
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,816
I'm nervous too.
My hands are shaking, like this.

224
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,320
So, there's someone in our class

225
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,115
that scored the highest in every subject
and ranked in first place.

226
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,244
That's right. It's Na Il-deung!

227
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,872
In all subjects?

228
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,832
What's the holdup? Clap!

229
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,543
Louder!

230
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,341
No. Don't come up. I'll go to you.

231
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,592
Don't get up.

232
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,011
Gosh! Thank you
for giving me the opportunity

233
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,721
to deliver such a rare report card.

234
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,017
Everybody else come up front.

235
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,812
-Kim So-hee.
-How come you won't deliver it to me?

236
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,856
You'll see why when you see your grades.

237
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,153
Take a look. You understand, right?

238
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,363
Song Woo-rim.

239
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,456
Here's the money as promised.

240
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
Good job.

241
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,921
Let me know about doing it for finals.

242
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,174
Hey…

243
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,844
Why are you doing all this?

244
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,099
Your rank overall was first
even without doing this.

245
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,524
What about you?
Why did you agree to my proposition?

246
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,240
We both got what we needed, right?

247
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,077
Oh, about the performance evaluations,

248
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,163
there's so much to submit
that it's been tough.

249
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,374
Do you want to do that for me too?

250
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,544
I'll pay you 200,000 won for each project.

251
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,760
Sure, fine.

252
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,723
Just let me know
which subjects you need me to do.

253
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,693
You're easier to talk to
than I thought you'd be.

254
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,368
Like you said, it's enough
as long as we both get what we need.

255
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:57,621
LOOKING FOR A MISSING PERSON
SEO HA-YOON, AGE 18, SEWOON HIGH

256
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,373
Do you happen to know Seo Ha-yoon?

257
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,584
I heard she went missing.

258
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,610
This whole situation
has me perplexed too.

259
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,446
Yeah, we'll be contacting you again.

260
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,906
Oh, and,

261
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,783
I'm sorry to say this, but

262
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,953
I barely had a chance
to notice anything weird.

263
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,165
It was a new semester,
with little time to learn the kids' faces.

264
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,627
Runaway or kidnapping,
we're not ruling anything out,

265
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,212
so please be patient.

266
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:51,383
If you reach Seo Ha-yoon or hear anything,
please call us immediately.

267
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,717
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

268
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,760
Thank you.

269
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,015
-Hello.
-Hello.

270
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,644
Hey. It looks like
Seo Ha-yoon is actually missing.

271
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,772
I doubt that.
She ran away from home last year too.

272
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,065
-Really?
-Yeah.

273
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,118
I knew you'd come.

274
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,540
I ended up going back.

275
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,460
Now, what should we try first?

276
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,505
First,

277
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,675
why don't you give me that hair tie?

278
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,803
-This?
-Yes, that.

279
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,729
Watch closely.

280
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,445
See, this ball…

281
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,619
has vanished.

282
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,496
This is "vanishing."

283
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:12,005
And making it appear again
is "appearance."

284
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,465
Even I know that much.

285
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,385
I performed a magic show once
during a school talent show

286
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,262
in elementary school.

287
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,473
Oh, really?

288
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,350
Then,

289
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,936
what about this?

290
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,485
Here. This is what you call a "change."

291
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,154
You didn't do this at your show, did you?

292
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,950
No. That's incredible.

293
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,786
It is, isn't it? This…

294
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,124
I thought someone was outside…

295
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,252
Someone's out there?

296
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,258
This is "misdirection."

297
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,679
Mis… What's that?

298
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,182
Look for yourself.

299
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,352
How did you do this?

300
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,189
"Misdirection" is
when you direct the audience's attention.

301
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:15,360
It lets the magician show what he wants
and hide what he wants.

302
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,987
And that's when you perform the trick.

303
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,325
-Trick?
-Yes, trick.

304
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,454
Didn't he say it wasn't trickery,
it's real magic?

305
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,456
What's up with this guy?

306
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,709
-How silly.
-Oh?

307
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,504
I know exactly
what you were thinking just now.

308
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,924
I'm not silly.

309
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,764
Listen to me carefully.

310
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,145
What I taught you just now

311
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,439
are stage tricks, but…

312
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,821
the fact that you're smiling right now
is real magic.

313
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,327
Isn't that something?

314
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,501
Now, since this is your first lesson,
let's start by practicing vanishing.

315
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,046
Yoon Ah-yi has something to do with him.

316
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,798
It has to be one of two reasons.

317
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,302
Money or love.

318
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,220
Yeah, try.

319
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,432
-Like this?
-Yes and grab this.

320
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,726
Then grab this.

321
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,480
-There you go.
-Is this right?

322
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,356
Yeah. Try again.

323
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,904
But how come
you don't look at me like that?

324
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,742
Yoon Ah-yi,
you weren't doing it for the money?

325
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,399
He can't be the owner
of this amusement park, right?

326
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,284
Should I report him for squatting?

327
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,788
Handsome. I love handsome men.

328
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,793
-More handsome than me?
-That's right.

329
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,964
All right, then.

330
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,758
Go to that good-looking guy.

331
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,850
You.

332
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,271
You seem to be very interested in me.

333
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,022
Or…

334
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:01,651
magic?

335
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,826
I'm more suspicious than interested.

336
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,830
You're a loser, seducing a minor
with your lame parlor tricks.

337
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,875
I'm worried
about the trouble you might cause.

338
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,838
Can you really…

339
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,552
afford to worry about other people…

340
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,639
right now?

341
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,393
Me?

342
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,854
I can always afford it.

343
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,775
That's something that only people
who've had luxuries would know about.

344
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,444
Are you

345
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,572
wearing any underwear?

346
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,199
What?

347
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,410
Oh, oh.

348
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,246
-Oh, look, it's your underwear.
-Wait, what…

349
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:00,960
Damn it.

350
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,255
What are you playing at?

351
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,967
I'm just joking around.

352
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,011
You were being so serious, right?

353
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,264
I was only trying to lighten the mood.
It's fun, isn't it?

354
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,308
Come on, you know it's fun.

355
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,522
Don't act like you're so happy
when you live in hiding

356
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,942
at an abandoned theme park like this.

357
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,526
Yeah?

358
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,073
Then,

359
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,284
what's wrong with you?

360
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,997
What are you so frustrated about?

361
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,755
Don't touch me, damn it.

362
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,509
Acting cocky doesn't change a thing.

363
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,262
People like you start in the gutter

364
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,682
and end up in the gutter.

365
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,475
Do you know that?

366
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,650
Isn't it too cold?

367
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,281
The path you're on?

368
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,244
Mere happiness is simple

369
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,206
Because you only need
To look straight ahead and run

370
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,128
Because you'll never trip
Over your feet and fall

371
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,674
Instead, you can't choose which direction

372
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,969
Instead, you can't stop when you want to

373
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:20,266
All you have to do is do as you're told

374
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,690
Are all the things you have
The things you want?

375
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:37,617
Are all the things you long for
The things you want?

376
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,285
Ask yourself

377
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,371
If your beating heart

378
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:47,919
Is beating

379
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,420
For yourself

380
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,298
Stop

381
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,510
Who are you living for?

382
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:03,184
It's just an inescapable trap

383
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,382
Who knows where you're even headed?

384
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:39,095
Maybe it's not even the real you
Who keeps on going

385
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,431
In that direction

386
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,225
-All you are
-All you are

387
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,186
Is a wind-up toy

388
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,691
All you can do is smile

389
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,986
For whoever that might be

390
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,281
Why do we keep running

391
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,117
In this ice-cold world?

392
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,704
Shake up your frustrated heart

393
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:10,877
And wake up!

394
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,756
Listen to whether your screaming heart

395
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,261
Is beating

396
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,972
For yourself

397
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,183
-Stop
-Stop

398
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,603
It's not too late

399
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,815
Muster the courage

400
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,611
To escape

401
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,141
What are you doing?

402
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,527
What is it? Are you all right?

403
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,160
You. What did you do to me?

404
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:28,996
Huh?

405
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:34,043
It looks like you're looking at me
differently compared to before.

406
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,504
Admiration? Or respect?

407
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,798
There's something
along those lines in your eyes.

408
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,091
No?

409
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,431
Want to see something fun?

410
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,148
Stop it.

411
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,695
Huh?

412
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,740
Here, it's a gift.

413
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,243
Do you think
you'll fool me with such lousy tricks?

414
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,162
"Lousy…"

415
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,834
You should still take it.

416
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,170
This isn't funny.

417
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,232
Are you okay, Ri-eul?

418
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,058
I heard you got your report card.

419
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,895
Your mom was so excited
when she told me this morning.

420
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,064
Yes.

421
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,857
So I asked her,

422
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,777
how little do you think
of Na Jin-man's boy

423
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,529
to make a fuss
over simply placing first at school?

424
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,286
It's been a while
since I've given you extra allowance.

425
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,830
How much do you think is enough?

426
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,542
About two… Two million won.

427
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:42,963
All right.
I'll transfer it to your bank account.

428
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:44,924
Thank you.

429
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,468
You're doing great.

430
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,220
Thanks.

431
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,571
Hey.

432
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,952
What? Do you need something else?

433
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,079
Oh, it's nothing like that.

434
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,293
-What's your relationship with him?
-What?

435
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,005
I happened to see the two of you
together at the amusement park.

436
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,637
Do you

437
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,182
know anything about that man?

438
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,017
Magician.

439
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,311
His name?

440
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:41,939
His age?

441
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,735
Whether he has
a criminal record or anything?

442
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,992
You know nothing about him?

443
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,454
Then why?

444
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,749
What if he's dangerous?

445
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,918
My gosh.

446
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,506
Are you really that naive?

447
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,386
How can you spend time with him
without knowing anything?

448
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,472
Why are you so curious?

449
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,974
It's unrelated to you.

450
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,268
Yes, it is! So don't ever go there again!

451
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,898
You know,

452
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,693
I think you have the wrong idea right now,

453
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,445
but don't tell me what to do.

454
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,031
Why should I have to listen to you?

455
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,409
I mean…

456
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,622
-Just because you're paying me--
-Hey, that's nonsense!

457
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,208
If that's not it, then what?

458
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,377
Come on, do I have to say it?

459
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,133
Of course it has something to do with me.

460
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,470
Anyway,

461
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,224
I'm warning you.

462
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,726
Don't go back there again.

463
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,076
That's it for today's lesson.

464
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,163
Do you have any questions?

465
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,250
I do.

466
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,211
-Mister?
-Yeah.

467
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,671
What's your name?

468
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,843
For now,

469
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,513
it's Ri-eul.

470
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,017
"For now, Ri-eul"?

471
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,143
Yes.

472
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,230
What about your family?

473
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,190
I have one.

474
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,025
"For now, Ri-eul."

475
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,111
Ri-eul is mine.

476
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,992
That's right, I am yours.

477
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,788
Then is this place really your home…

478
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,586
Never mind.

479
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,259
Ah-yi.

480
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,181
Want me to tell you a secret?

481
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,101
A secret?

482
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:35,279
I didn't settle
in this amusement park for nothing.

483
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,072
I mean,

484
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,951
people don't know this,

485
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,370
but here, right here,

486
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,375
there's a path
that leads all the way up to the heavens.

487
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,259
And where might that be? Where is it?

488
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,677
Over there…

489
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,730
This mailbox?

490
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:15,277
Yes. Inside this mailbox is another world,
transcending time and space.

491
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,655
Even without my help,
you can send a message

492
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,074
to wherever your heart desires
if you put it here.

493
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,620
For instance, you might get a response
back from your mother.

494
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,748
Okay.

495
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:34,129
All right. It's your choice
to not believe me.

496
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,673
Goodbye. Take care.

497
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,352
You idiot, did you really believe that?

498
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,816
Gosh, you're ugly, and you're stupid too.

499
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,502
-Who are you?
-Sorry?

500
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,130
Oh.

501
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,720
I'm a student, learning magic here.

502
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,681
-Who…
-Oh.

503
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,768
It looks like
he's teaching magic too these days.

504
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,147
What? Who is this person?

505
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,205
-What is all this?
-Just something.

506
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,791
Wow, looks delicious.

507
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,794
You didn't have to go to the trouble.

508
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,045
It's nothing.

509
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,547
I thought it was just him and his parrot.

510
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,717
Is he married?

511
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,093
Try this, too.

512
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,985
Okay. Get to the edge.

513
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,737
Turn.

514
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,206
Damn it.

515
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,793
It wasn't anything like this.

516
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,381
It was way more realistic. It felt real.

517
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,801
How on earth did he do it?

518
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,265
It can't be actual magic, can it?

519
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,569
LOOKING FOR A MISSING PERSON

520
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:55,956
Look carefully.

521
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,127
This is a basic one-hand ball rolling.

522
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:01,795
Like this…

523
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,216
This is the two-hand method.

524
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,011
Wow.

525
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,431
And next…

526
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,313
Ta-da.

527
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,983
What do you think? Do you want to try?

528
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,943
-Yes.
-Okay.

529
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,613
Ta-da.

530
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,116
-How did you do that?
-Now you try.

531
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,076
-This.
-Yeah.

532
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,202
Slowly.

533
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,663
One finger at a time.

534
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,123
-Like this?
-Yeah.

535
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,417
Then slowly, just like that.

536
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,628
Like this. And then under.

537
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,089
Relax your fingers. One by one.

538
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,716
Four…

539
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:50,969
Sorry.

540
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,057
Oh my goodness!

541
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,101
Na Il-deung?

542
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,526
What are you doing here?

543
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,036
I told you.

544
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,373
It's related to me too.

545
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,381
Please, continue what you were doing.
Don't mind me.

546
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,856
Welcome to Ri-eul's magic show.

547
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,657
Watch closely. One.

548
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,117
Two.

549
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,288
Amazing.

550
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,206
-Right?
-Yes.

551
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,461
-This amazes you?
-Yeah, it does.

552
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:09,756
Stop.

553
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,634
It stopped.

554
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,265
I think I saw this on YouTube.

555
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,685
Would you care to grab this?

556
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,353
No.

557
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,571
One. Two. Three.

558
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,116
Ta-da.

559
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:46,543
Il-deung. Go ahead and pick
as many as you want.

560
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,797
-As many as I want?
-Yes.

561
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,341
Pick some cards.

562
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,772
Hey, it's only a fake spider.

563
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,608
-It's on fire.
-What?

564
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,109
-What?
-Oh no.

565
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,036
It's so cool, Mister.

566
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,621
Lesson over.

567
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:24,956
Bye.

568
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,469
It's on fire!

569
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,061
Hey.

570
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,481
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

571
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:51,983
Let me see it.

572
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,152
-I'm fine.
-You shouldn't touch it.

573
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,280
My gosh.

574
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:12,838
I'm going to stop
accepting money from you.

575
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,218
I had a lot of regrets about it.

576
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,973
I'll give you back all of the money
you've given me so far too.

577
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,184
It might be hard

578
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,938
to return everything right away.

579
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,525
-But if you can wait, I'll work--
-Let's forget about it.

580
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,822
You and I are the only ones
who know about it.

581
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,663
Please just forget about it.

582
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,457
Can you do that for me?

583
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,516
Oh, this. The Band-Aid.

584
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,187
Tell me if it hurts.

585
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,693
Hang on.

586
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,738
You're overreacting.

587
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,831
-What?
-Blow on it.

588
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:38,673
Seriously.

589
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,723
-Do we have anything?
-Yes. Take a look at this.

590
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,310
There are four damaged banners in total.

591
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,105
For three of them,
there are no cameras or it's too dark.

592
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,233
There's just one,

593
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,945
but even in this one,
you can just barely make out the attire.

594
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,655
LOOKING FOR MISSING PERSON

595
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,532
What is this?
That's a pretty unique outfit.

596
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,744
Right? It's definitely
not a common outfit.

597
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,288
Look at this other footage too.

598
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:16,711
This place is where Seo Ha-yoon's
last phone call was traced to.

599
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,341
Fishy, right?

600
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,594
Can we zoom in to identify him?

601
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,973
How could we possibly check
anyone's identity with just this?

602
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,730
See if we can find
any witnesses around there.

603
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:39,276
And check to see if there were
any kinds of events around April 25th,

604
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,569
like performances or corporate events.

605
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,779
Yes, sir.

606
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,084
Ri-eul, does it hurt?

607
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,630
It doesn't.

608
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,433
Ri-eul is in pain.

609
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,063
Don't worry.
It really doesn't hurt at all.

610
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,567
It's just

611
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,237
a small remnant

612
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,449
of a very old memory.

613
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,512
What is it?

614
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,264
What?

615
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:58,355
Yoon Ah-yi. The teacher wants to see you.

616
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,799
Late last night,

617
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,594
Il-deung's mother called me.

618
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,683
She said that recently large amounts
of money were withdrawn from his account

619
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,354
and that he looks very depressed.
She's very worried about him.

620
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,359
From my 20 years of experience
as a teacher, I had a thought.

621
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,402
"Oh,

622
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,823
maybe he's being bullied or blackmailed

623
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:53,034
by someone at school."

624
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,667
And then I saw that this was posted

625
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,087
for everyone to see on the school forum.

626
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:22,856
An explanation is needed, don't you think?

627
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:36,734
