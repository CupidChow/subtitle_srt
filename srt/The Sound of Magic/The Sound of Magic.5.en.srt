00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm real.

8
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,591
I'm a real magician.

BE QUIET INDOORS
117 - SCHOOL VIOLENCE HOTLINE

10
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,127
Are you done?

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,049
It's a shame the camera's battery died
at the most important moment.

12
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,929
What do you think happened next?

13
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,766
I wonder where he stabbed him.

14
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,269
Is he dead?

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,147
Having fun?

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,906
Yoon Ah-yi.

17
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,326
All right.

18
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,580
To be honest,
I used to think you were really weird.

19
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,167
But

20
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,003
after watching this video,

21
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,592
I started to think
that maybe you're a victim too.

22
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,887
Victim?

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,143
I saw you run out
of the amusement park before.

24
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:29,190
And it's also weird how that man
told me to tell you he's waiting for you.

25
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,404
I don't know what happened, but if you--

26
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,281
-Watch it--
-Hey, Baek Ha-na.

27
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,745
I…

28
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,749
know your type very well.

29
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,379
You pretend to care about people
while exposing weaknesses,

30
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,215
and pretend to comfort them
while looking down on them.

31
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,677
It's all very obvious, you know.

32
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,598
-What?
-I don't really care how you behave.

33
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,101
But what that man means to me as a person

34
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,438
is for me to decide, isn't it?

35
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,278
So don't you dare mouth off
when you know nothing.

36
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,617
Hey!

37
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,663
This is what I get
for looking out for you.

38
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,210
That makes me very curious.

39
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,089
What kind of person is he really?
That man you know.

40
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,428
From what I see,

41
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,307
he's just a crazy guy.

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,446
He is

43
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,910
a real magician.

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,966
What did she just say?

45
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,511
Is she so shocked that she lost her mind?

46
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,472
Watch your mouth.

47
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,688
USB.

48
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,316
So you can report it?

49
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,195
Why?

50
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,949
-Is there a reason I shouldn't?
-No.

51
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,869
They're gonna check
the source of this video first,

52
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,580
but it's a spycam, right?

53
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,294
You might be taken in
for questioning before the magician.

54
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,629
Just so you know.

55
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,891
He's crazy too.

56
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,439
A real magician?

57
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,984
Yoon Ah-yi!

58
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,652
Wait.

59
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
Hey, Yoon Ah-yi!

60
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,869
Where are you rushing off to?

61
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
Today, I actually

62
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,793
saw a police officer looking for someone
who looked like the magician.

63
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,171
The police? Why?

64
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,923
I don't know the details.

65
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,426
So I'm going to go find out
what's going on.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,431
So are you going
to the theme park right now?

67
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,599
What if there was…

68
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,354
actually a murder?

69
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,318
You're going to say to him,
"I think I saw you kill someone"?

70
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,279
-It can't be true.
-How can you believe that?

71
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,078
It's not that I believe it.

72
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,456
I want to believe it.

73
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,876
Because I think I know him

74
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,213
better than Ha-na or the police at least.

75
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:37,313
A special prize for good conduct
goes to Na Il-deung, from grade 2 class 1.

76
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,360
So…

77
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,696
mind your own business.

78
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,117
Hey. Hey, Yoon Ah-yi!

79
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,124
Na Il-deung! Get in.
There's gonna be traffic.

80
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,463
Damn it.

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,764
What?

82
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,808
What is he doing?

83
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,643
I'm scared!

84
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,270
What is it?

85
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,105
I'm scared!

86
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,189
What is it?

87
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,149
Please stop.

88
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,986
-I'm not going to watch it.
-I'm scared.

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,823
-Stop.
-Please stop.

90
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,139
Now.

91
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,057
-What's that?
-What?

92
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,684
This goes in. Huh? This.

93
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,937
-This too.
-Huh?

94
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,651
-What?
-And there's one here too.

95
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,112
Where did it come from?

96
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,655
-Here!
-Wow!

97
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,866
-There's so many!
-If I put it in here…

98
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,493
Oh!

99
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,286
Ta-da.

100
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,747
That's so cute!

101
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,790
-Here, it's a gift.
-Thank you.

102
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,668
It's so cute.

103
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,472
Wow, it's all out now!

104
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,017
I had so many things I wanted to ask,

105
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,147
but why does it feel like
I've already heard the answers?

106
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,945
I'm going to catch it all!

107
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,506
Oh.

108
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,842
You're the student learning magic, right?

109
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,261
Yes.

110
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,266
Wait, if it's not too much to ask,

111
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,353
can you give me your phone number?

112
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,773
Why do you need my number?

113
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,695
I heard that you come here a lot.

114
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,241
It's nothing much.

115
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,416
Could you please contact me
if something should happen later?

116
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,295
If something happens?

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,426
Then, could you give me
your number instead?

118
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,345
That'd be better.

119
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,185
Thank you.

120
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,062
See you later.

121
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:06,647
Sure.

122
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,209
I'm real. I'm a real magician.

123
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,798
Drink up, No-rang.

124
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,676
Yoo-yi.

125
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:37,928
Yeah?

126
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,807
That magician that dropped by
our house that one time,

127
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,852
how did he seem to you?

128
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,482
Well, he's pretty good-looking.
Not my type, though.

129
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,527
No, not like that.

130
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,988
Like, you know…

131
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,116
Did he seem like a good person,

132
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,994
or a criminal,

133
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,874
or a real magician?

134
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,335
A magician?

135
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,629
Legit? For real?

136
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,464
Yeah.

137
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,593
I think…

138
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,850
you need to get some rest.
Studying is hard, right?

139
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,480
I don't think you have a fever.

140
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,655
So cute.

141
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,084
How can you believe that?

142
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,794
It's not that I believe it.

143
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,131
I want to believe it.

144
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,844
So mind your own business.

145
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,327
What's wrong?

146
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,246
Do you have a headache again?

147
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,750
-It's nothing.
-Let me see. You don't have a fever?

148
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,626
I said I'm fine.

149
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,466
Don't touch it!

150
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,474
Exams are just around the corner.

151
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,227
You're already feeling ill,
so just take care of yourself.

152
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,604
I'll clean this up.

153
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:15,961
Shit!

154
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,673
Jeez. Dumbass bird…

155
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,392
Is this blood?

156
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,270
Oh my gosh.

157
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,658
Be quiet. Please.

158
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,077
Please, be quiet.

159
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,268
Oh, you scared me.

160
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,941
It's me. You remember me, right?

161
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,696
What is it now?

162
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,117
You know, I'm very interested in you.

163
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,664
I recently started to be
very interested in magic,

164
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,584
so I was thinking
maybe I could learn magic here.

165
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,296
Oh! I heard
that Yoon Ah-yi comes here too.

166
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,301
Come again later.

167
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,222
Later? Again?

168
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,019
I guess I picked the wrong day again.

169
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,439
I'll come back another day then.

170
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,030
But…

171
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,368
is it really my magic?

172
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,375
The thing you want to know

173
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,545
and see?

174
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,009
I thought I was clear last time.

175
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,388
Sneaking around and peeping…

176
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,733
is disrespectful

177
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,319
to magic.

178
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,782
Actually,

179
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,285
I'm not that interested in magic.

180
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:59,041
Besides, if I really wanted to see magic,
I'd pay to see it in a theater.

181
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,334
Why would I come here?

182
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,216
Then what's the real reason
you came all the way

183
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,470
to a place like this?

184
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,101
To get evidence.

185
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,359
I thought I should let other people know

186
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,153
what's going on

187
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,823
in a place like this.

188
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
What happened to this guy?

189
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,342
If I'm mistaken, tell me it's not true.

190
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,391
Is there really a need
for me to answer that?

191
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,561
Just

192
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,105
think whatever you want.

193
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,232
It's one of two things.
Either I'm not guilty,

194
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,526
or if I am, nobody can catch me.

195
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,619
I think it's one of these two.

196
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,836
You're either a con artist
pretending to be a magician, or…

197
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,011
you're a psycho who believes himself to be

198
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,013
a real magician.

199
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:50,819
I don't care if you think I'm truly crazy,
but my magic?

200
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,404
My magic is real.

201
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,574
So don't you dare
lay your hands on my stuff.

202
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,619
Whatever!

203
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,541
You know that what I'm recording
is being saved automatically, right?

204
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,171
Give it to me.

205
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,051
Give it to me!

206
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,511
What are you doing?

207
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,804
Get your hands off me!

208
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,180
What are you doing?

209
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,536
What more do you want me to show you?

210
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,041
What do you want me to say?

211
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,211
-What do you want from me?
-Let go of me!

212
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,004
I'll do whatever you want.

213
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:07,729
Bella.

214
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,190
Bella.

215
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,471
Baek Ha-na.

216
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,187
What's wrong?

217
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,440
Are you okay?

218
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,738
Seriously?

219
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,117
It freaks me out
the more I think about it.

220
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,829
No wonder there are
strange rumors about him.

221
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,501
I wanna run to the police right now,
but will I be okay?

222
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,922
What if he comes after me to take revenge?

223
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,594
Are you sure it was the magician?

224
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,181
You're not mistaking someone else for him?

225
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,478
What are you talking about?

226
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,856
I mean, I'm just saying…

227
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:39,279
No matter how much I think about it,
I just can't believe

228
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,157
that it's the same person.

229
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,373
Hey. Take a good, hard look.

230
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,792
He definitely did this.

231
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,420
He flipped out
and tried to choke me to death.

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,090
Can you say it wasn't him
after seeing this?

233
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,681
Tell me.

234
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,017
Is there something I don't know?

235
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,354
I said tell me!

236
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,316
I don't know either.

237
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,782
I don't know.

238
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,208
You and Yoon Ah-yi

239
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,338
have totally gone crazy, huh?

240
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,095
All right then. Just wait
until it happens to you guys too.

241
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,780
NATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT TESTS

242
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:11,246
Baek Ha-na called in sick,
but everyone else is here, right?

243
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,914
-Yes.
-Okay.

244
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,990
KOREAN - NA IL-DEUNG

245
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,666
What is it?

246
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,460
I…

247
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,338
I have a terrible headache.

248
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,101
Can I leave?

249
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,146
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

250
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,565
All right then.

251
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,937
How's the headache?

252
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,190
It's better now.

253
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,488
Yesterday, Baek Ha-na…

254
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,907
Yeah. So-hee told me in the morning.

255
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,204
I heard something awful happened
to Ha-na at the theme park.

256
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,667
Is that true?

257
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,256
I think so.

258
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,596
I think it's best
you don't go there for the time being too.

259
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,643
It doesn't matter.

260
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,025
I know how weird I must seem to others.

261
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,366
I mean, the way
you're blindly trusting the magician

262
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,034
when bad things keep happening,

263
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,080
it's a little hard to understand.

264
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,585
That's why it doesn't matter.

265
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:52,842
I never had anyone
that understood me anyway.

266
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,185
You know how when we were little,
we used to wait for Santa Claus?

267
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,649
There were a lot of times I resented him.

268
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,862
I heard he visited all the other kids,

269
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,324
but why did he never come to me?

270
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,913
I remember being sad
and disappointed every Christmas.

271
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,210
I…

272
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,840
wish that Ha-na was just lying.

273
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,595
And that the police looking for him

274
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,224
turns out to be nothing.

275
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,313
I really,

276
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,233
really want to believe

277
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,820
that even though it's a little late,

278
00:26:56,323 --> 00:27:01,828
Santa… finally came to me too.

279
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,322
Bella.

280
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,741
Il-deung.

281
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,079
I heard you turned in
a half-empty answer sheet.

282
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,414
I'm sorry.

283
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,042
-I wasn't feeling good.
-In the middle of a test?

284
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,461
Where did it hurt? How bad?

285
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,048
I had a headache.

286
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,759
I felt like I was going to pass out.

287
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,178
Then you should have
just passed out instead!

288
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,764
Then they would have let you
retake the test at least!

289
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,892
What are you saying to your sick son?

290
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,436
My gosh.

291
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,314
It's because I think
his health isn't the problem.

292
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,567
This is not like you.

293
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,489
I knew it.

294
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,952
What is all this?

295
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,830
I was going to let it slide once,

296
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,957
but now I have to know.

297
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,502
What's the reason
you're obsessing over these stupid things?

298
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,131
I just like it.

299
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,633
What's the use of all this?

300
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,596
You're doing this because you enjoy
watching me flip out, aren't you?

301
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,475
Then what am I supposed to do?

302
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,394
Because if I'm happy, you suffer,

303
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,188
and if you're happy, I suffer.

304
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,564
What?

305
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,857
Enough, both of you!

306
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,401
Il-deung, sit down. And you stop it.

307
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,247
Well, if you're having such a hard time,

308
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,625
then you need to take a break, okay?

309
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,715
Il-deung.

310
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,427
When you were little, you told me

311
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,348
that you decided
to study law because of me.

312
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,936
I was so happy to hear that from you.

313
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,271
Do you remember?

314
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,567
-Yes.
-Good.

315
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,030
What part of my life seemed so cool
in the eyes of that little boy?

316
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,574
Wherever you went,

317
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,705
people lined up, trying to impress you,

318
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,125
and it seemed amazing.

319
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,047
It felt like I was someone important too,
just by being by your side.

320
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,507
That's right.

321
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,760
That's the reason you need to persevere
even though it's hard now.

322
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,680
Isn't it worth it when you and your family

323
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,392
could live a life like this forever?

324
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,354
Answer me.

325
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,650
Yes.

326
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,617
But what if…

327
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,706
I find something

328
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,918
that doesn't pay well

329
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,840
and people don't respect me for,
but it's meaningful to me?

330
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,550
Son.

331
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,928
That's just pretentious!

332
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,556
What people without accomplishments say!

333
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,100
So what if you don't have accomplishments?

334
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,353
You can still be happy
without the approval of others.

335
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,606
I've seen it.

336
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,941
Where? Who is like that?

337
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,529
Some magician.

338
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,240
Magician? What are you talking about?

339
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,743
What is going on with you?

340
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,248
So you're saying instead of becoming
a judge, you'll be a magician?

341
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,501
You don't need things like money or honor?

342
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,129
Then what are you going to live for?

343
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,799
What do you get from doing magic?

344
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,509
What exactly do I have to get?

345
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,263
Mom.

346
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:18,603
Are you trying
to get something out of raising me?

347
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,854
You brat!

348
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,023
What is this nonsense?

349
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,233
You,

350
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,321
you pathetic boy.

351
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,866
Come on. Let's go!

352
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,369
Wait.

353
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,835
I'm not giving up on you.

354
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,131
From tomorrow, I'm taking you
to and from school and tutoring.

355
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,094
Don't you even dare think about spending
a single minute as you please.

356
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,097
We award this student,
for he has achieved an excellent score

357
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,641
AWARD CERTIFICATE
NA IL-DEUNG

358
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,227
I am a lucky person.

359
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:32,320
I am going fast
on a straight and even asphalt-paved road.

360
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,989
So people

361
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,409
who are walking slowly
on a winding, messy dirt road

362
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,912
can never beat me.

363
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,083
So I am always on top.

364
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,089
I have walked this asphalt road,
thinking it's a blessing.

365
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:56,302
If I just stay on this road
that my parents have already paved,

366
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,972
I will arrive safely at a good college

367
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,683
and a good job after that.

368
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,624
But

369
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,129
after meeting the magician,
one question suddenly hit me.

370
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,216
Am I driving of my own free will?

371
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,930
This road is so fast
that I can't see my surroundings clearly.

372
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,852
I can't just keep driving forward
without knowing where the end is.

373
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,622
Slowly.

374
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,081
Try.

375
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,542
-I think I can do it.
-Yeah.

376
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,753
-One by one.
-Yeah.

377
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,048
-Like this. One by one.
-You're good at this.

378
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,760
-One by one…
-You're doing great.

379
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,306
What kind of adult
did I dream of becoming?

380
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,645
What makes a good adult?

381
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
Is success

382
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,653
moving forward according to
a well-made plan without ever failing?

383
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,489
If I succeed,

384
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,616
will I be happy?

385
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,328
I don't know.

386
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,957
Right now,

387
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,295
I just want to run
through this huge field of flowers.

388
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,405
What do I have to do

389
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,907
to reach that place?

390
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,868
Oh my.

391
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,912
Oh my goodness.

392
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,415
Who are you?

393
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,666
Do you…

394
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,419
believe in magic?

395
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,046
Believe in what?

396
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,175
Jesus Christ, what a psycho.

397
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,895
Please, don't kill me.

398
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,313
I'm sorry.

399
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,482
Don't kill me.

400
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,401
Please! Oh my…

401
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,612
Oh my goodness.

402
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,407
Please spare my life.

403
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,536
Oh my.

404
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,689
Is anyone here?

405
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,204
Excuse me.

406
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:13,429
Hurry up.

407
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,765
Yoon Ah-yi,
the teacher wants you in the office.

408
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,700
Miss.

409
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,163
There was a mugging last night,
near this school.

410
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,998
A mugging?

411
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,916
Yes.

412
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,588
You know the magician
that lives in the theme park, right?

413
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,556
The victim made a statement
that the magician attacked her.

414
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,937
I heard that you often hang out with him.

415
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,689
Were you there yesterday as well?

416
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:07,775
No.

417
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,777
Sir,

418
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,446
what do you mean by mugging?

419
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,325
He threatened a passerby
with a knife and stole her purse.

420
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,203
At first, he said something like,

421
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,539
"Do you…

422
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,000
believe in magic?"

423
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,549
Anyway, he approached her,
saying something strange like that.

424
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,925
That can't be right.

425
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,512
He's not the kind of person
to do such a thing.

426
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,642
Ah-yi, how do you know this person?

427
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,147
I guess we'll find out
during the investigation.

428
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,530
Oh, one of the reference witnesses
insisted on talking to you.

429
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,618
He'll be here soon.

430
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,390
PLEASE KNOCK
COUNSELING IN PROGRESS

431
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,316
Hello.

432
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,028
Wow.

433
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,446
How pleasant.

434
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,783
We're finally meeting.

435
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,331
Do you want something to eat?

436
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,208
You can tell me anything.

437
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,046
Oh, you poor young thing.
In this cruel world.

438
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,010
Do you know this man?

439
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,138
Yes.

440
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,350
Oh boy, do we know each other.

441
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,061
Hey, let me see your face.

442
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,855
Where is that son of a bitch?

443
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,484
Do you know
where the magician is right now?

444
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,110
Any places you can think of?

445
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,949
No, I don't know anything
other than the amusement park.

446
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,243
Yeah, right.

447
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,996
Even if you do know, you don't, right?

448
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,375
These two, they're in it together.

449
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,710
-In it together?
-Yes.

450
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,587
This case is not their first time.

451
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,131
Hey. Do you know

452
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,801
what I went through back then,
because of the two of you?

453
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,718
Wait a second.

454
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,971
-Back then?
-Yes!

455
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,640
Back then!

456
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,559
I said come with me!

457
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,320
Do you

458
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,532
believe

459
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,201
in magic?

460
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,245
Do I believe in what?

461
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,539
What the… Get lost!

462
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,877
Don't you remember?

463
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,588
When you and that crazy bastard
pushed me down the hill!

464
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,174
What the hell! Let go of her!

465
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,760
-What is wrong with you?
-Okay, hold on.

466
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,720
Listen!

467
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:26,390
She came into my store as a part-timer

468
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,101
and asked for her pay in advance.

469
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,604
Then she lured me to the top of that hill
where the amusement park is.

470
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,691
And when I gave her the money,
as soon as she got it,

471
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,819
that psycho showed up
as if they'd planned it in advance!

472
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,571
Annara

473
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:42,906
sumanara.

474
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,421
He suddenly just pushed me
over the railing!

475
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,013
-Liar!
-Liar?

476
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,973
You've got to be kidding me.

477
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,100
Hey. Does this look like a lie to you?

478
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,436
I got this on my face because of that fall

479
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,520
and injured my back!

480
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,523
And how will you compensate me
for when I had to close the store?

481
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,777
-This can't be right.
-You know.

482
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,695
He disappeared that night.

483
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,947
…because I have good reflexes.

484
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,076
That wasn't just assault.
It was attempted murder.

485
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,578
You hear? But now what?

486
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,664
Now I hear he's mugging people?

487
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,458
Threatening old people with a knife?

488
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,835
-You little…
-Stop! Come on!

489
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,672
Is what this person saying true?

490
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,304
No. He was trying to help me that night--

491
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,181
Look, you have to catch him quickly.

492
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,518
He's not normal. He's extremely dangerous!

493
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,521
What are the police officers
of this country doing?

494
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,689
Letting a lunatic wearing a cape

495
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,150
go about doing all these insane things?

496
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,109
Excuse me, sir!

497
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,612
This is a school! Do not make a scene!

498
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,114
-That's all a lie.
-Just put both of them in jail!

499
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,116
She's an accomplice!

500
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,244
It wasn't the magician.

501
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,083
Il-deung…

502
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,335
What do you mean?

503
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,798
I was with him
at the amusement park last night.

504
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,426
-What?
-You?

505
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,928
What time was that?

506
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,682
Around 11:00 p.m.
When did the victim report the crime?

507
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,226
11:15 p.m.

508
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,355
Then I'm certain.
As long as there aren't two magicians.

509
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,446
-Are you in it with them too?
-Come on, man.

510
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,534
You know that man well too?

511
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,286
Yes.

512
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,789
But

513
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,293
why were you there so late at night?

514
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,259
-That's…
-Look at that.

515
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,970
See? He can't answer.

516
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,973
Why were you there?

517
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,100
Why were you there?

518
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,437
I asked you why you were there!

519
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,595
Il-deung.

520
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,848
Were you really there last night?

521
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,269
Yes.

522
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,230
Did you see the magician then?

523
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,669
I did.

524
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,508
Look at me.

525
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,844
I've become a total mess

526
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,598
after meeting the magician.

527
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,239
You know what's funny though?

528
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,785
It's true that I'm a mess

529
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,913
because of the magician…

530
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,216
but I don't want

531
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,596
to go back to the way things were.

532
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,566
MOM

533
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,614
COUNSELING OFFICE

534
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,119
Thank you for coming at such short notice.

535
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,412
It's nothing.

536
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,497
I'm sorry to worry you.

537
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,208
No. It's okay.

538
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,126
It's fine.

539
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,171
Come in.

540
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,257
Oh, Il-deung.

541
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,219
Come here. Sit down.

542
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,726
All right then.
Take your time to talk among yourselves.

543
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:03,935
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

544
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,698
Hey. Il-deung, are you out of your mind?

545
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,535
How could you lie like that
in front of the police?

546
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,996
I wasn't lying.

547
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,956
And if you weren't?

548
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,167
Then,

549
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,089
are you saying you were actually
hanging out with a robber?

550
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,346
He's not a robber. I'm the witness.

551
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,973
Stop this now.

552
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,769
I'm saying I saw it for myself.

553
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,022
I was just telling them what I saw--

554
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,065
Even if you did see,

555
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,359
I'm saying don't say you did.

556
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,778
What happens if I don't?

557
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,782
An innocent man is wrongly accused.

558
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,409
Innocent?

559
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,043
He is far from being innocent.

560
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,464
He's illegally living
in the amusement park, he's jobless,

561
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,009
his outfit, the way he speaks and acts…

562
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,470
Everything is suspicious.

563
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,808
He's responsible
for making people feel unsafe,

564
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,685
so of course he should be investigated.

565
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,937
You said it, didn't you?

566
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,024
Money, honor, and people's respect.
You don't need any of that.

567
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,025
Just wait and see.

568
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:38,738
Do you think anyone will believe
that magician, despite what he says?

569
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,283
That's what is called

570
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:46,538
a social stigma.

571
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,418
You're going to see with your own eyes
just how ugly the result is.

572
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:55,964
If you really thought things would change
by you stepping up, then you're wrong.

573
00:52:56,047 --> 00:53:00,177
You are nothing
without the shield of being my son.

574
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:06,933
That's why you have to become an adult
that everyone will acknowledge.

575
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,020
Do you understand?

576
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,372
Na Il-deung.
Were you actually with that magician?

577
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,792
Why would you hang out
with someone like him?

578
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,628
You're that kind of guy?

579
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,422
-I heard that man is a robber.
-I knew something was up.

580
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,591
He's lying because of Yoon Ah-yi, right?

581
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,344
Has he not heard any of the weird rumors?

582
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,515
There's always a valid reason
when everyone thinks the same thing.

583
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,446
He doesn't live up to his looks.

584
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,740
-Yeah.
-I knew it.

585
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,575
Seriously. That's too bad.

586
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,119
Now I know.

587
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,748
No one in the world is crazy.

588
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,254
They make you into a crazy person
little by little, if you don't fit

589
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,007
society's standards.

590
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,280
Why do you keep going astray?

591
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,865
Just keep following
the asphalt road I've paved for you!

592
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,809
-Go help.
-Hey, are you okay?

593
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,250
Mister?

594
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,462
If you're a real magician,

595
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,175
can you break this curse of the asphalt

596
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,093
that I'm under?

597
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:58,730
Someday, will I be able
to escape this cold road

598
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,401
and run through a huge field of flowers

599
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,571
just like you?

600
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,576
No, please…

601
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:04,744
