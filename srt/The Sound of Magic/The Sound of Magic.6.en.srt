00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:21,396
LOOKING FOR A MISSING PERSON
NAME: SEO HA-YOON

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,858
The police started an investigation
when around 7 a.m. this morning, a body,

3
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,485
presumed to be a high-school girl
missing for two months,

4
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,738
was found near Mirim Reservoir
in Seongjin-dong.

5
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
In order to identify the victim,

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,075
the police have requested
the NFS to expedite the results

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,994
from the DNA gathered at the scene.

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,913
They plan to identify
cause of death with an autopsy.

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,960
-Hello.
-Did you check?

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,297
Well, we won't know for sure
until the DNA test results come in,

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,925
but the teeth are almost
identical to Seo Ha-yoon's dental records.

12
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,595
Any signs of homicide?

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,931
The decomp is pretty bad,
so it's hard to tell.

14
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,434
We'll have to see the autopsy
to know cause of death.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,314
Sir!

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,071
I found this near the amusement park.

17
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,324
Items that belonged to Seo Ha-yoon.

18
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,701
Shit.

19
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,714
Hey. I think the police are here
because of Seo Ha-yoon.

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,883
The news said her body was found.

21
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,385
-Yeah.
-But why would they come here?

22
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,347
Is there something
to investigate at school?

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,973
-Investigate?
-It can't be…

24
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,726
-What?
-What?

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,769
What is it?

26
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,272
Oh. Ha-na recently was in danger too.

27
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,274
-Ha-na?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,612
She almost died because the magician
at the amusement park choked her.

29
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,324
-For real?
-Hey, let's go.

30
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,036
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,378
Bring back my daughter.

32
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,631
Bring my daughter back, right now!

33
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,882
-Ma'am.
-Bring her back!

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,468
Calm down please.
You're going to pass out.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,054
I…

36
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,431
I can't live without my daughter.

37
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,975
How can I live without her?

38
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,601
Oh…

39
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,770
My poor Ha-yoon.

40
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,898
What are you going to do?

41
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,234
-Ma'am.
-What are you going to do?

42
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,694
I am so sorry.

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,116
But we stayed up for days,
looking everywhere to find Ha-yoon.

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,618
We're furious

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
and hurting too.

46
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,293
But once we get the autopsy results
and find any suspicion of crime,

47
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,044
we'll investigate thoroughly,

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,714
and we'll catch the criminal.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,508
What's the point of all that now?

50
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,635
I begged you.

51
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,054
I begged you

52
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,308
to find her

53
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,977
before she died.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,228
Before she…

55
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,855
Ma'am, please calm down.

56
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,273
Ma'am, are you okay?

57
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,692
-Hey.
-Hey, bring some water over here!

58
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,861
Ma'am, stay with us.

59
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,154
-I have evidence.
-Okay--

60
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,405
Let go of me!

61
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,115
-Sir.
-Yeah?

62
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202
-We have a report for assault--
-Hey! I told you, it's not assault.

63
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,995
-It's attempted murder!
-Murder?

64
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,998
Look at this.
Does this look like assault to you?

65
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,299
Understanding social phenomena
and the cultural context implied in them.

66
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,384
In the field of social culture,

67
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,763
social phenomena and the system,
historical…

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,723
THE LAST PERFORMANCE

73
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Mister.

74
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,497
Mister.

75
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,085
"Then you pull the lever…"

76
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,245
Mister, is that you?

77
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,798
I didn't know a space like this existed,
so I was worried sick.

78
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,766
The police are looking for you.

79
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,894
You have to go hide someplace else.

80
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,106
My Bella

81
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:40,900
is…

82
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,946
very sick right now.

83
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,202
Is it really bad?

84
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,122
What happened?

85
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,543
There was just a little accident.

86
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,672
It's okay.

87
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,553
Then I'll take her
to the hospital for now,

88
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,430
but you have to go somewhere else.

89
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,017
Bella, are you okay?

90
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,396
Can you hear me?

91
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm here.

92
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,159
Sorry.

93
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,328
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,249
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,417
When I was little,

96
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
I bought a chick outside my school
for 1,000 won.

97
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,175
I remember naming it
and spending time with it.

98
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,513
Of course, it got sick
and then died before long.

99
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,187
But back then,

100
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,982
I was a real child…

101
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,317
Are you okay?

102
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,320
…who could cry out loud
to express just how sad I was.

103
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,491
-It's okay.
-Just like he is right now.

104
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,911
As if he lost his whole world.

105
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,541
Mister,

106
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,461
I'll take her to the hospital first.

107
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,088
-No, not the hospital.
-What?

108
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,593
Bella says she doesn't want
to spend her last days in the hospital.

109
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,807
She said she's not afraid of death,

110
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,145
but she doesn't want to be lonely.

111
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,356
Right?

112
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,568
I'm going to let her do
whatever she wants.

113
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,866
Mister, what are you talking about?

114
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,037
The police are going
to raid this place any moment now.

115
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,457
Police?

116
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,167
Yes.

117
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,129
Why are the police looking for me?

118
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,889
They think you're the culprit

119
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,351
for the mugging on that rainy day.

120
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,439
And I think they suspect you
of a bunch of other stuff too.

121
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,527
I have nothing to do with that.

122
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,532
Really?

123
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,242
Yes.

124
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,540
So there's no reason for me to run.

125
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,375
What if…

126
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,713
What if no one believes you?

127
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,010
-No one?
-Yes.

128
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,388
What if no one really believes you

129
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,601
no matter how much you say it isn't true?
What will you do then?

130
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,355
What about you then?

131
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,778
You…

132
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,699
You don't believe me either?

133
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,537
Huh?

134
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,167
Tell me.

135
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,503
You really don't believe me either?

136
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,391
Mister.

137
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,394
Come over here.
It looks like there's something here.

138
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,148
Yes, sir. We're over
by the stage on the first floor.

139
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,042
Ryu Min-hyuk?

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,882
We're looking into robbery,
assault, and murder charges.

141
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,425
Come to the station with us.

142
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,809
Let go.

143
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,145
I told you, I have no reason to run.

144
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,691
It'll just be a second.

145
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,861
You have the right to remain silent.

146
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,488
You have the right to an attorney.

147
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,032
You have the right
to appeal unlawful detention.

148
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,662
No, you can't.

149
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,372
Miss, what are you doing?

150
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,377
Na Il-deung from my class has already
testified he was with him that night.

151
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,463
Do you have clear evidence
that he's the perpetrator?

152
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,507
Miss.

153
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,137
We are conducting an investigation
because there are sufficient suspicions.

154
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,471
Liar.

155
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,349
Isn't it that
you've already decided he's guilty?

156
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,185
You've only listened to the people

157
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,439
who've never even met the magician
at the amusement park.

158
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,815
Am I wrong?

159
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,899
Ah-yi.

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,779
Ryu Min-hyuk.

161
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,782
We're taking you
into custody for questioning

162
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,494
due to concerns of fleeing
and destruction of evidence,

163
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,956
and difficulty confirming personal
information, with no permanent address.

164
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,751
Here's the warrant,
according to procedure. All right?

165
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,300
-No. No, stop.
-Miss!

166
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,221
If you don't stop,
we'll take you in for obstruction.

167
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,974
Ah-yi.

168
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,895
Enough.

169
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,731
That's enough.

170
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,944
I told you I didn't do it.

171
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,491
I…

172
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,369
just need someone who can tell me that

173
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,789
no matter what others say,
it's not important,

174
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,375
and someone who believes me.

175
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,295
Yeah. That's all I need.

176
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,966
Mister.

177
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,055
And I'm coming back soon,

178
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,558
so…

179
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,147
can you look after Bella
for me in the meantime?

180
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,984
I don't have anyone else to ask
besides you.

181
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,679
Hey, miss.

182
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,432
Hey, what's your relationship with him?

183
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,060
Are you sure
you really know who that man is?

184
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,733
Do you want me to tell you?

185
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,615
Name, Ryu Min-hyuk.

186
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,909
Age 30. Born in Seoul.

187
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,411
Dropped out of high school.

188
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,165
Ten years ago,

189
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,544
he went missing
while being treated in a mental hospital.

190
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,590
Three years ago,
he was investigated twice as a suspect

191
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,884
during a missing-student case
in Seongmi-dong.

192
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,054
Aside from this, he's frequented
the police station for similar reasons.

193
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,352
How can you trust him enough
to hang out with him?

194
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,896
Aren't you even a bit scared

195
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,232
after seeing your classmate
go through such a horrific incident?

196
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,944
Go home.

197
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,333
What kind of person is he actually?
That man you know.

198
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,251
Because from what I see,

199
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,671
he's just a crazy guy.

200
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,176
He suddenly just pushed me
over the railing!

201
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,846
She almost died because the magician
at the amusement park choked her.

202
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:37,830
Rather than wanting to believe

203
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:45,129
I want to say I actually believe

204
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,843
But I'm still

205
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,722
Too scared

206
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,725
No, I'm

207
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,147
Greedy

208
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,609
Beneath my desire

209
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,739
To fly

210
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,784
There is a me

211
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,496
That knows I can't fly

212
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,501
A foolish me

213
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,964
That is crouching somewhere

214
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:35,012
Between being a child and an adult

215
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,687
Without a doubt

216
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:52,488
You make me happy, but…

217
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,457
Perhaps it's that
I want to hide for a little while

218
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,919
Under the shadow

219
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:12,591
Of dream-like magic

220
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:20,808
I hate my trembling self

221
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:28,774
Who can't take a step

222
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:33,070
Anywhere

223
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:54,091
Perhaps it's that
I want to forget for a little while

224
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:03,308
All these things
That are like a dream, a lie

225
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:11,942
I hate my stumbling self

226
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,283
For not being able to decide

227
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,661
On

228
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,748
Anything

229
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:01,992
Ah-yi!

230
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,166
Where is he?

231
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,630
The police came and took him
a little while ago.

232
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,008
As I expected.

233
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,514
The truth will be uncovered soon.

234
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,978
The officer said
they did a background check on him.

235
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,649
Is he really a crazy person?

236
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,444
What if he's…

237
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,615
a really dangerous person?

238
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,163
What does your heart say?

239
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,878
I don't know.

240
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,053
I'm not sure
if it's that I don't believe him

241
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,224
or that I do believe him,

242
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,645
but am scared that I might be wrong.

243
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,901
Because everyone is saying I'm wrong.

244
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,281
So I'm not sure anymore.

245
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,623
You have me.

246
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,462
You believe him,

247
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:39,881
and so do I.

248
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,884
Isn't that enough?

249
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,056
I…

250
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,977
just need someone to tell me that

251
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,313
no matter what others say,
it's not important

252
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,941
and someone who believes me.

253
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,861
Yeah. That's all I need.

254
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,324
Yeah.

255
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,750
I have to see someone.

256
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:26,136
I reached out because I thought
of what you said to me the other day.

257
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,431
Thank you for letting me know.

258
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,143
I'll try to figure out a way
to help as well.

259
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,318
But how do you know him?

260
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,404
We're friends.

261
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,407
I went to high school with Min-hyuk.

262
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,288
"Ryu Min-hyuk, age 30."

263
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,334
I heard he dropped out of high school.

264
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:05,133
It's already been over ten years.

265
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,603
Min-hyuk was a brilliant kid.

266
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
RYU MIN-HYUK

267
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,357
Even the kids from other schools
knew about him.

268
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,443
He was always the top student,
since middle school.

269
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,862
He was smart and good-looking,

270
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,451
and his parents were well-known professors
that were on TV a lot too.

271
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,746
His siblings were all outstanding too.

272
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,043
Hey, someone told me to give this to you.

273
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,545
MIN JI-SOO

274
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,802
She says she really likes you.

275
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,388
Aren't you curious about who it is?

276
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,640
Do you want me

277
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,226
to tell you?

278
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,854
No, don't tell me.

279
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,398
Why?

280
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,069
Tell her that I didn't accept it
because I didn't know who gave it to me

281
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,573
and not to be too disappointed.

282
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,539
Show-off…

283
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,129
What do you want to do in the future?
Have you decided your goal?

284
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,507
I don't know. I haven't thought
about things like that yet.

285
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,635
Then why are you always studying so hard?

286
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,347
Because it makes my parents happy
when my grades are good.

287
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,765
What?

288
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,726
Hey.

289
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,228
That's a joke, right?

290
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,189
Wow, unbelievable.

291
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,858
He was as pure as a sheet of paper.

292
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,446
Perhaps he really was an actual magician,
considering how the memory

293
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:55,368
of being rejected by my first love
is still so beautiful in my mind.

294
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,206
Anyway, after the first year,

295
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,083
we were in the same class again
for our third year.

296
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,671
But by then, Min-hyuk was a bit different.

297
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,685
Min-hyuk.

298
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,730
Min-hyuk.

299
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,818
-Oh. Hi.
-We're in the same class again.

300
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:43,917
And for some reason,
his grades were dropping as well.

301
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,149
Hey!

302
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,734
-Min-hyuk!
-Min-hyuk!

303
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,528
-Min-hyuk!
-Min-hyuk!

304
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,785
Ryu Min-hyuk.

305
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:23,039
A plus… square, plus…

306
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,875
You're suffering from stress
and malnutrition! Stop studying.

307
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,669
…raised to the fourth power…

308
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,256
Hey! What is up with you?

309
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,424
Give it back.

310
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,803
What are you trying to do
that you're studying this much?

311
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,597
I just want to do well.

312
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
You're already doing great.

313
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,768
With your grades, you can do anything,
med school, law school!

314
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,854
No, it's still not enough.

315
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,273
I'm not like my brother and sister.

316
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,860
I keep getting questions wrong.

317
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,449
I really don't want
to let my parents down.

318
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,200
Min-hyuk.

319
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,497
Stop worrying about your parents

320
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,043
and look at your face right now!

321
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:16,593
A brilliant boy from a family
of prestigious professors.

322
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,013
Maybe for Min-hyuk,
that impressive wrapping paper

323
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,808
felt like an invisible prison.

324
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,395
And then one day,

325
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,900
it was a few days
before the mock CSAT test.

326
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,461
Pretty.

327
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,428
-Hey!
-Oh, no.

328
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,638
-Min-hyuk!
-Hey!

329
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,764
What are you doing?

330
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,016
Step back, Ryu Min-hyuk!

331
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,726
What are you doing?

332
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,478
Step back!

333
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,106
Min-hyuk!

334
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,068
What are you doing? Come down from there!

335
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,903
Min-hyuk!

336
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,781
Min-hyuk, please! Get down from there!

337
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,325
Please, come on.

338
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,453
Please come down from there, Min-hyuk.

339
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,122
Come down, please?

340
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:30,875
Min-hyuk.

341
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,963
Min-hyuk, get down from there!

342
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,012
No, stop. Min-hyuk!

343
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,614
He was taken to the hospital right away,

344
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,410
and that was the last time I saw him.

345
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:12,083
Fortunately,
they were able to save his life,

346
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,213
but I heard that he was being treated

347
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,009
at a mental hospital
and he was recovering.

348
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:26,097
And then you only recently saw him again?

349
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,016
Yes.

350
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,269
I bumped into him after ten years.

351
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,481
I was shocked at first.

352
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,110
That kid who was always
so worried about reality is a magician?

353
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,572
In a way,

354
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:47,327
I thought
that it was very like Ryu Min-hyuk.

355
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,542
But Min-hyuk is not someone

356
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,838
who would commit robbery, murder,
or anything horrifying like that.

357
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,051
You still won't confess?

358
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,596
You don't know Seo Ha-yoon?

359
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,563
Let's take a break.

360
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,454
We found a knife with Ryu Min-hyuk's
fingerprints on it at the theme park.

361
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,332
It's a close match,
in terms of size and shape, to the weapon

362
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,167
the mugging victim reported.

363
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,711
Oh, and take a look at this video.

364
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,339
Baek Ha-na brought this to us.

365
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,761
There was a physical fight backstage.

366
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,852
I think

367
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,563
he used this knife here too.

368
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,153
You mentioned traces of blood backstage.
Are the results in?

369
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
There were two people's DNA.

370
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,157
One is Ryu Min-hyuk's,

371
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,828
and the other one,

372
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,872
we don't know yet.

373
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,332
But

374
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:17,959
this man…

375
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,587
Do you think he's dead?

376
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,048
Or he's alive, but didn't report to us?

377
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,907
I never thought that Min-hyuk was crazy.
Not then, not now.

378
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,244
Looking back,

379
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,456
Min-hyuk back then…

380
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,877
was crying out for help.

381
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,714
But no one heard him.

382
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,471
I want to ask you something.

383
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,306
Okay.

384
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,850
How did you come to that hill yesterday?

385
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,313
You cried for help. In your mind.

386
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,194
I don't think he wanted
to become an adult.

387
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,782
He hated and feared becoming an adult

388
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,117
like his parents and teachers,

389
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,330
who everyone said were great,

390
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,041
becoming like the adults who trapped him.

391
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,585
So maybe

392
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,714
that's why he just wanted to stay a kid.

393
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,844
Like a child that believes

394
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,639
in real magic.

395
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:05,942
MOM

396
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,155
Yes, hello.

397
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,993
Yes, that's right.

398
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,164
What?

399
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,254
No. Not at all.

400
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,548
Excuse me--

401
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,054
He disappeared in the middle
of being questioned at the police station.

402
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,015
What?

403
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,817
-You okay?
-Yeah.

404
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,362
-Do you want to take a break?
-No, I'm okay.

405
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,661
So it's Ah-yi. Your name.

406
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,666
Wow, that means you'll still be a child
even when you're all grown up.

407
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,878
I'm not saying
to only do what you want to do.

408
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,047
I'm saying
you should do the things you want

409
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,383
just as much as the things
you don't want to do.

410
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
I'm a real magician.

411
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,849
Tell me.

412
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,519
You really don't believe me either?

413
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,611
I don't think Min-hyuk wanted
to become an adult.

414
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,286
He had no choice.

415
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,998
At some point,

416
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,127
the world became a place
people like you can't live in.

417
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,964
Because if you don't meet
the set standards,

418
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,092
you are treated like a failure.

419
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,847
That's what I thought at first too.

420
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,892
That you are living your life,
running away,

421
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,561
because you'd failed to adapt to reality.

422
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,525
But you know what?

423
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,278
I think I kind of understand now.

424
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,366
Since when did this world

425
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,328
become a place
where even dreams have to meet a standard?

426
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:29,085
Just what kind of qualifications
are necessary to become a respected adult?

427
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,004
I just need to be me.

428
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,426
So why do we try so hard
not to fall too far from the norms

429
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,887
of the average person?

430
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,891
Why don't you go to the park first?

431
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,646
I'm going to get my backpack from school
and look around some other places too.

432
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,023
Okay. Sure.

433
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,327
Mister.

434
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,330
I miss you.

435
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,669
Where are you?

436
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,674
SEWOON HIGH SCHOOL

437
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,301
I got it off the Internet.

438
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,429
-What do you think? Does it suit me?
-Ridiculous.

439
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,891
Put it away, dumbass.
Why would you pay for something like that?

440
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,268
A murderer in a magician's hat. See.

441
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,064
-It's fucking cool.
-Whatever.

442
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,982
Man.

443
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,692
If I'd known what would happen,

444
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,361
I would've visited the theme park
before he got arrested.

445
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,239
Well, I am fucking curious, though.

446
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,783
-You know Yoon Ah-yi, in class one?
-Yeah.

447
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,369
She hung out at the amusement park
all the fucking time.

448
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,246
-Okay.
-Why do you think that is?

449
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
Maybe she's a pervert too.

450
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:55,963
Hey. Who could tell who you are
if you're dressed like this in the rain?

451
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,799
Nobody would know, whatever you do. Look.

452
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,134
Do you…

453
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,845
believe in magic?

454
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,060
Think before you speak,
you son of a bitch.

455
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,687
Na Il-deung, are you out of your mind?

456
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,732
You piece of shit.

457
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,400
-You son of a bitch.
-Hey, come on!

458
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,110
Stop it! Hey! Enough!

459
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,337
Ryu Min-hyuk.

460
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,761
Hey, Ryu Min-hyuk.

461
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,686
What are you doing right now?

462
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,564
Why are you making things
harder than they have to be?

463
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,566
If you don't cooperate,

464
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,568
you'll only be adding to your charges.

465
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,198
Cooperate?

466
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,411
How much more am I supposed to cooperate?

467
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,955
I told you everything. Oh.

468
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,418
Is it only going to be over
if I say that I did something I didn't do?

469
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,220
Come on. Let's do this the easy way.

470
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,516
Since there are records
of your medical treatment,

471
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,269
it can be considered
as extenuating circumstances.

472
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,905
Psychiatric hospitals, prisons.

473
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,865
I mean,

474
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,826
there's no use,
locking me up in places like that.

475
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:50,870
Because…

476
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,459
escapology…

477
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,841
is my specialty.

478
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,479
We got in touch with your family too.

479
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,984
They are more than willing to pay
for an attorney and medical treatment.

480
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,825
Treatment?

481
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,311
What should we do?

482
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,775
Take him by force.

483
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,487
All right.

484
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,447
Stay calm,

485
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,367
and come with us to the station.

486
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,664
Mister!

487
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,228
Hey, miss!

488
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,482
I just need one second.

489
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,944
I need to tell him something.

490
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,174
Back then,
Min-hyuk was crying out for help.

491
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,552
But no one heard him.

492
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,935
What about you then?
You don't believe me either?

493
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,506
What the hell is this?

494
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,008
Is it snow?

495
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,135
But we're indoors.

496
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,108
You piece of shit!

497
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,153
You crazy bastard!

498
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,116
You know nothing.

499
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,577
-So shut up!
-Goddamnit!

500
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,162
Crazy bastard!

501
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,833
Hey! What do you know then?

502
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,711
-Hey.
-What do you know, you psycho?!

503
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,297
Who do you think you are?

504
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,882
-That's enough!
-Son of a bitch!

505
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,050
-Knock it off.
-Let go!

506
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,261
Let go. You piece of shit!

507
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,845
-Hey!
-Let go, you bastard!

508
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,014
-Someone's going to see us!
-Damn it.

509
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,100
-Stop it.
-What an asshole!

510
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,228
What's that fucker keep on saying, anyway?

511
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,814
He's saying that the magician was framed.

512
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,191
What a fucking hero!

513
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,860
-Knock it off, jeez.
-Let go!

514
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,445
This is fucking ridiculous!

515
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,951
Where is it coming from?

516
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,162
There's no one up there.

517
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:05,100
I don't think it's that you came to me

518
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,981
You were waiting, and I noticed you

519
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,777
That was something close to magic

520
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:21,325
Me believing in the world once more

521
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:30,501
When I pretended to give up
With my head down

522
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:36,340
There were words
Hanging at the tip of my feet

523
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,427
Maybe, just maybe

524
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:45,599
Something unbelievable might happen to me

525
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,435
Maybe

526
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,648
Some coincidences

527
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:57,277
Are a long wait

528
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:10,040
Desperation

529
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:16,755
Becoming sounds

530
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:23,762
And traveling afar and coming back

531
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,557
To brighten up today

532
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,353
Once more

533
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:36,900
Desperate beliefs

534
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:43,031
Take shape

535
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:49,830
And when I hold them tight in my hands

536
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,541
The world, once again

537
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:59,590
Is on my side

538
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:27,117
Desperate beliefs

539
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:32,706
Become the wind

540
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,917
And when it blows

541
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,335
And when it blows

542
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,254
-Into my arms
-Right next to me

543
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:43,258
I feel

544
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:50,140
That I am not alone

545
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,938
I can see myself

546
00:46:56,688 --> 00:47:03,570
I've grown this much

547
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,340
Mister.

548
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,555
You're a real magician.

549
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,601
Because you made me

550
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,856
really believe in magic.

551
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,028
Thank you.

552
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,155
For helping

553
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,658
my magic succeed.

554
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,251
Here.

555
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:07,968
And this is

556
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,637
my gift to you.

557
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,267
Now, if you put this on
and recite the spell,

558
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,936
the thing on your mind will

559
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:19,980
certainly

560
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,608
come true.

561
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:30,866
Ryu Min-hyuk.

562
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,289
Let's go now.

563
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,485
His magic

564
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,072
wasn't able to make
all of my misfortune go away,

565
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,282
but I know

566
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,537
the power of magic that he showed me.

567
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,546
Wait a second.

568
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,103
Mister.

569
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,650
Do you…

570
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,487
believe in magic?

571
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:06,712
Magic doesn't create miracles,

572
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,549
but allows you to discover them.

573
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:13,802
Annara

574
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,471
sumanara.

575
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,175
Where did he go?

576
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,887
Where'd he go?

577
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,389
-What are you doing? Look for him!
-Yes, sir.

578
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,068
How should we live life?

579
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,030
A lot of adults give a lot of answers.

580
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,825
How would an immature child

581
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,244
answer that question?

582
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,622
Would that answer

583
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,709
be wrong?

584
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:41,973
BELLA
WE HOPE YOU'RE NOT LONELY UP THERE

585
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,563
A little while
after the magician disappeared,

586
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,274
Bella also left our side.

587
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,822
Yoo-yi and I were there by her side

588
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,990
every second until her last.

589
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,705
For Bella, who was more worried
about loneliness than death.

590
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,713
-What is it?
-Sir.

591
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,965
Take a look at this.

592
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,884
It's not from
when Ryu Min-hyuk disappeared,

593
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,345
but we were going through footage
near the theme park

594
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,097
and found something strange.

595
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:26,768
The amusement park
has been neglected for a while now,

596
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,354
so as you know,
none of the cameras are working.

597
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:34,860
But there was one camera that recorded

598
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,572
about four to five minutes two months ago.

599
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,794
Come on.
How many times do I have to tell you?

600
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,296
It's not me!

601
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,965
Goddamnit, this is fucking ridiculous.

602
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,889
Take a look at this footage first,

603
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,600
and then we'll talk.

604
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,517
What's this?

605
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,492
TWO MONTHS AGO

606
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,250
What were you doing?

607
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,381
This is why I don't hire high schoolers.
They always stab me in the back.

608
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,299
Hey.

609
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,636
I gave you this job
because I fucking pitied your situation.

610
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,930
You just started,
and you're already taking cash?

611
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,806
Taking cigarettes?

612
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,434
-I won't--
-You little fuck.

613
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,352
Huh?

614
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,563
What now? Should we go
to the police station right now?

615
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,441
No, sir, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

616
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,318
-Please, forgive me.
-Bullshit.

617
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,070
How can I trust you?

618
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,615
You little bitch.

619
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,576
Sir, I'm sorry.
I swear, I'll never do it again.

620
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,246
Please forgive me just this once. Please?

621
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,749
I won't do it again, sir.

622
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,671
If I let this one slide,

623
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,590
will you be good?

624
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,677
Yes. I'll work really hard.

625
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,012
Please give me one more chance.

626
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,722
How?

627
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,559
How hard are you going to work?

628
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,396
Tell me.

629
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,279
How are you going to be good?

630
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,119
You were wrong, right?

631
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,293
If you needed money,
you should have just said so.

632
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,920
You can't go around
doing bad things like this--

633
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,133
Huh? What?

634
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,389
What the--

635
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,895
How are you going to--

636
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,149
Sir. Do you want to call it even?
With the money and cigarettes I took?

637
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,442
You get over here.

638
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,447
Oh, right. I'm a minor.
Is that too cheap of a price?

639
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,991
I should get like a million won more.

640
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,368
-Hey.
-Stay back. I'll post it right away.

641
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,372
You look fucking disgusting.

642
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,216
What the fuck is this place?

643
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,177
I'll get the cash and meet you.

644
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,847
Come to the amusement park on the hill
in an hour, and bring your phone.

645
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,725
-That abandoned amusement park?
-Yeah.

646
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:57,145
Or would you rather make this exchange
where everyone can see us?

647
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,230
Right? Hey.

648
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,400
I can't afford to fall
for your bullshit again.

649
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,320
Fuck.

650
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,113
Where is he?

651
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,809
I'll ask again, Mr. Kim Doo-sik.

652
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:44,692
Do you admit to the murder of Seo Ha-yoon
and the disposal of her body?

653
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,031
-No, I mean, this is--
-Sit down.

654
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,450
No. Listen.

655
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,079
She stole from me,
so I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

656
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,039
Just to frighten her a little bit.

657
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,417
There's no proof that I killed her!

658
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,840
You put Ryu Min-hyuk's fingerprints
on the knife you used to kill her

659
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,759
and buried it on the hill
where the amusement park is!

660
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,681
Not too deep. Just some dirt on top,
so that the police won't miss it.

661
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:49,716
This is what we found
in the basement of your house.

662
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,633
What?

663
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,430
Please spare my life.

664
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,806
Please.

665
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,060
You put this on and committed robbery,
murder, and disposal of a dead body.

666
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:06,024
You dreamt of a magical, perfect crime,
didn't you, you bastard?!

667
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,193
No…

668
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,195
-Fuck.
-Cuff him.

669
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,572
Goddamnit.

670
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,910
-Wait!
-Sit down, you son of a bitch!

671
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,077
-Son of a bitch!
-No!

672
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,370
Stay still!

673
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,206
Fuck, I didn't kill Seo Ha-yoon!

674
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,708
I didn't do it, you motherfuckers!

675
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,711
Fuck! What the fuck!

676
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,422
It wasn't me, you sons of bitches!

677
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,967
VISITORS TO THE RIGHT
PARKING

678
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,427
Set the record straight?

679
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,221
Yes.

680
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,766
I want to officially file a report.

681
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,189
The convenience store owner

682
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,776
sexually harassed and threatened me.

683
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,740
I thought this would

684
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,911
make me feel less sorry
towards the person who helped me.

685
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,707
No, more importantly

686
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,670
it's only right that the person
who did the crime be punished.

687
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,548
Of course.

688
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,552
Just a second. I'll get someone
from Women and Juvenile Affairs.

689
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,057
Please send Soo-ah down here.

690
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,021
Oh, miss.

691
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,025
Can I ask you something?

692
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,610
Yes.

693
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,572
About two months ago,

694
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,700
late at night on March 11th,
to be precise,

695
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,578
something strange happened
at the amusement park.

696
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,122
What happened?

697
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,623
It's just that

698
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,043
the security camera
that's been broken for years

699
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,046
suddenly started working
for about four minutes.

700
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,339
And in that footage,

701
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:56,509
we can see very colorful, flashing lights.

702
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,346
We can't figure out what happened
at the amusement park.

703
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,349
Were you by any chance there that night?

704
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,518
Or is there anything you can think of?

705
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,645
Well…

706
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,774
I don't really know…

707
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,111
Of course, you don't know either.
That's fine.

708
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,779
Wait here.

709
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,994
March…

710
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,584
MAY - APRIL

711
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,544
March 11th.

712
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,422
A few days after the semester started.

713
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,884
Late at night?

714
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:40,970
Annara

715
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,808
sumanara.

716
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,470
Hey, Na Il-deung.

717
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,644
Do you really have to do this?

718
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,062
DROP-OUT REQUEST

719
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,358
You only slipped up in one test…

720
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,529
You have to be strong,
especially when you're at your weakest.

721
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:44,951
You know,

722
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:48,329
that incident last time
ended smoothly thanks to your dad,

723
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,790
and you'll get into a good school
if you keep it up.

724
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,460
So why are you suddenly now choosing
to go the hard way?

725
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,760
I want to try taking that hard way.

726
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,554
What?

727
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,390
I didn't know before

728
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,270
that flowers don't bloom on smooth asphalt

729
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,607
but on bumpy dirt.

730
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,236
Thank you for everything.

731
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:24,532
Hey, Il-deung.

732
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:26,951
Na Il-deung.

733
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,814
The late spring days
when it magically snowed were over,

734
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:02,236
and I was slowly becoming an adult.

735
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:06,908
Mister.

736
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,452
Are you doing well?

737
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,122
It's already winter again.

738
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,500
The weather is so cold.

739
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,127
-I hope you didn't catch a cold.
-Du-bu.

740
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:21,798
Here.

741
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:26,344
You remember my little sister, right?
Yoo-yi is going to middle school soon.

742
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:31,974
Kko-mi. You only laid one today?

743
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,518
Make sure you lay two tomorrow.

744
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,396
Get up and eat.

745
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,773
The sun came up hours ago!

746
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,400
What kind of college student
has this many part-time jobs

747
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,236
instead of studying?

748
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,363
She nags so much.

749
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,740
She thinks she's the big sister now.

750
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,450
Wow.

751
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,576
Looks good.

752
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,831
-You made all this?
-If not me, then who?

753
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,834
I guess raising you
was worth it, after all.

754
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,754
It's Dad.

755
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:04,882
Hi, Dad.

756
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,885
Yeah, we're good.

757
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,012
How's it over there? Is it cold?

758
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,976
Dad. Can you come home this weekend?

759
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:18,896
Our dad got a job in the countryside
last year and comes home every weekend.

760
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:19,856
I'll put Yoo-yi on.

761
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,732
We still have a lot of debt left,

762
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,069
but I'm also helping,
so we're slowly paying it back.

763
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,691
The world has changed a lot,

764
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:07,028
but the amusement park
and the performance stage are still here,

765
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:08,863
frozen in time.

766
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,892
It's not as often as before,

767
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,977
but I still try
to write letters when I can.

768
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:43,356
I write to my mom, to Bella, and…

769
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,691
to you.

770
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,529
I can't write addresses on any of them,

771
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,823
but you get all of them, right?

772
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,327
Because this is a magical mailbox.

773
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,833
Mister.

774
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,128
This is how I'm living.

775
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,715
I feel like I've become a boring adult.

776
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,224
Please enjoy. Enjoy the food.

777
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,351
-Hello.
-Oh, Ah-yi. Bad traffic, right?

778
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,186
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No, it's okay.

779
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:25,106
The birthday table is Table C1,
so you can go ahead and set up.

780
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,565
Okay, I'll prepare it quickly.

781
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,234
Here's your gift. Happy birthday.

782
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,485
Thank you.

783
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,861
Hello.

784
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,405
-Hello.
-It's the magician lady!

785
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:33,614
The magician lady!

786
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,408
Did you enjoy the food?

787
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,867
-Yes!
-Yes!

788
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,329
Then I'll show you
a very cool magic trick.

789
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:41,872
Are you ready?

790
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,750
Here is a rose.

791
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,544
I realized after you left.

792
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,465
I can't become a magician
that everyone in the world believes,

793
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:56,512
but I can become a magician
for at least one person.

794
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,432
I'll give this
to my little friend over here.

795
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,975
Thank you.

796
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,269
And the butterfly…

797
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,105
It's gone!

798
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,608
Wow. How did it get there?

799
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,194
This butterfly here

800
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,947
is a butterfly that brings happiness.

801
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:18,534
You know, I'm going to keep trying.

802
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,120
To become a good adult

803
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,165
that gives little miracles to people,

804
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,625
just like you did for me.

805
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,295
Are you curious what happiness will come?

806
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,755
I am.

807
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,591
So compliment me a little, okay?

808
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,593
Let me ask you one question.

809
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:36,969
That I'm doing well.

810
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,599
That I will continue to do well.

811
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,225
Do you…

812
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,271
-believe…
-…believe

813
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:50,775
in magic?

814
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:51,729
When you were young
You spread the wings of your dreams

815
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:56,901
And your heart
Would shout out of excitement

816
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:57,818
But why

817
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:03,073
Do your dreams now rush
To draw the line in advance

818
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,744
And drop their heads?

819
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,789
The stronger I resist

820
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,459
Saying that it's silly

821
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,796
It resonates even louder

822
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,425
See, your heart just fluttered

823
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,011
Make your own fantasy

824
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,223
Spread your worn-out hopes

825
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:32,353
That you crumpled and put away

826
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,939
Sincerely, sincerely

827
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,943
When I believe in myself

828
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,820
I finally find out

829
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:46,408
The secrets of all that magic

830
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:52,539
If you just break out of the mold

831
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:57,920
Of the word "destiny"

832
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:02,341
There is a world

833
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,637
Just for you

834
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,810
Make your own fantasy

835
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:15,271
Spread your worn-out hopes

836
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:19,900
That you crumpled and put away

837
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:23,237
Sincerely, sincerely

838
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,157
When I believe in myself

839
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,868
I finally find out

840
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:35,416
That every second right now is actually…

841
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,460
Make your own fantasy

842
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,422
Spread your worn-out hopes

843
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:46,593
That you crumpled and put away

844
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,263
Sincerely, sincerely

845
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:52,933
When I believe in myself

846
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:56,145
I finally find out

847
01:11:56,228 --> 01:12:02,276
That every second is actually…

848
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:04,903
Make your own melody

849
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,489
I want to hear your own song

850
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:12,619
Not anyone else's

851
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,331
Sincerely, sincerely

852
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:19,209
When I believe in myself

853
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,546
I finally find out

854
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:26,967
That every second right now is actually

855
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,262
Fantasy

856
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,265
Goodbye, everyone!

857
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,185
See you!

858
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:37,936
Goodbye!

859
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:48,770
