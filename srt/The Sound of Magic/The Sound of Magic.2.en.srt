DIRECTOR: KIM SEONG-YOON

5
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,949
DON'T LET ME DREAM ANY LONGER

6
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,288
Annara

7
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,171
sumanara.

8
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,886
What was that last night?

9
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,138
Was it a dream?

10
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,016
No.

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,312
I remember how the wind was blowing
and even the smell of grass…

12
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,455
Well…

13
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,169
I was thinking about
what you said to me the other day.

14
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,174
About questions that have no answers
no matter how hard you look.

15
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,094
And you specifically asked about magic.

16
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,265
Yeah.

17
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,352
There definitely are
mysterious things in this world

18
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,854
that science can't explain.

19
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,316
But even so,
there's no such thing as real magic.

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,736
That's my opinion.

21
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,033
If you're interested in hearing the logic
behind how I came to this conclusion,

22
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,451
we could talk about it.

23
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,746
Are you free

24
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,417
after class?

25
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,797
What are you doing?

26
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,632
Huh?

27
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,553
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you just say something?

28
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,555
No.

29
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,602
The bell. The bell just rang. Yeah.

30
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,231
Bye.

31
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,317
This…

32
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,496
Magic simply confuses
a person's sensory organs.

33
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,292
People want to believe
what they see and hear is real.

34
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,588
It's a clever gimmick
that takes advantage of that desire.

35
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,547
Do you get it?

36
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,887
"Gimmick…"

37
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,769
Huh?

38
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,356
Ha-yoon missed morning assembly.
She's still not here?

39
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,649
-No.
-She didn't come in.

40
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,735
She's absent without so much as a call?

41
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,114
And I'm the dean of students!

42
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,449
She's got some nerve.

43
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,576
See you tomorrow. Dismissed!

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,662
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

45
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,665
I'll get going.

46
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,749
Okay, bye.

47
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,543
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

48
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's go get tteokbokki.

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,217
Goodbye.

50
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,886
See you tomorrow.

51
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,059
NA IL-DEUNG

52
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,620
Look who it is.

53
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,789
Hello.

54
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,751
You texted in the middle of the night,

55
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,421
saying that you quit.

56
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,964
Why are you here?

57
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,593
I was here yesterday too.

58
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,762
And it was temporarily closed.

59
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,723
Well, I guess stores have to close

60
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,393
when part-timers like you
quit after working just three days.

61
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:16,107
I can't reach the owner,
and there's no one to work the shifts.

62
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,069
You can't reach him?

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:20,987
No.

64
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,780
Hey, do you know anything?

65
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,450
The other employees told me

66
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,119
no one's heard from him
since he left to talk with you.

67
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,456
Hello, welcome.

68
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,728
Should I just report it to the police?

69
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,190
Oh my goodness.

70
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,860
How can he live in a place like this?

71
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,288
Oh.

72
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,130
Hello?

73
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,465
Hello?

74
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,181
Is anyone here?

75
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,850
Anyone here?

76
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,479
-Who's there?
-Who's there?

77
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,778
Is there

78
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,239
someone there?

79
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:58,019
Were you the one who answered?

80
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,687
What? Yeah.

81
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,489
Hi.

82
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,241
I'm Yoon Ah-yi.

83
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,327
So what?

84
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,454
You're ugly.

85
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,832
It really was you.

86
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,792
Nice to meet you.

87
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,045
So what? You're ugly.

88
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,880
Man.

89
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,550
He should have taught her
to say nice things.

90
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,761
The boss is a bastard.

91
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,811
Did the magician say that?

92
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,523
He disappeared, the bastard.

93
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,027
He disappeared

94
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,947
for real?

95
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,199
He disappeared, the bastard.

96
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,160
The boss disappeared, that bastard.

97
00:08:56,244 --> 00:09:00,331
He disappeared, the bastard.

98
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,333
The boss is a bastard!

99
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,671
He disappeared, the bastard.
The boss is a bastard!

100
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,678
It looks like
it hasn't moved in ten years.

101
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,595
Right?

102
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,769
Huh? Is that it?

103
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271
Where the magician lives?

104
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,649
Wow, the vibe here is amazing.

105
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,611
-It's better than I expected.
-Oh, I have to go to the academy.

106
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,571
Let's leave.

107
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,447
-I don't like it here.
-Okay.

108
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,616
This is enough exploring for today.

109
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,579
But you have to actually
play along next time, okay?

110
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,040
Okay, I'll play along for real next time
so let's get out of here.

111
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,208
Come look at this.

112
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,502
This place is a million views guaranteed.

113
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,505
-I can totally feel it.
-Whatever. You have like ten subscribers.

114
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,091
-You little…
-Huh?

115
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:53,843
Hey.

116
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,137
Isn't that Yoon Ah-yi?

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,641
Why is she coming from there?

118
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,143
What is going on?

119
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,894
Look.

120
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,190
That's Yoon Ah-yi, right?

121
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,919
He disappeared, the bastard.

122
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,422
The boss disappeared, that bastard.

123
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,141
Mom.

124
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,352
If, just if,

125
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,064
my boss actually disappeared,

126
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,359
is the man that helped me that night

127
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,319
a good person

128
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,112
or a bad person?

129
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,531
Or is he

130
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,159
really

131
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,287
a magician?

132
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,044
Yoo-yi.

133
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,754
Ah-yi.

134
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,385
-Who is that?
-Hmm?

135
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,470
Oh my goodness!

136
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,471
-Huh?
-Huh?

137
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,597
Oh.

138
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,808
-Huh?
-Hi.

139
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,478
Why are you at my house?

140
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,938
Oh, is this your house?

141
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,857
Wow, it's pretty.

142
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,569
I mean, I just kept following the road

143
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,948
in front of me,
and it led me to your house.

144
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,992
For real.

145
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,704
I didn't even cast a spell this time.

146
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,790
Are you sure you didn't just follow me
from the theme park?

147
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,547
You're smart.

148
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,801
By the way, Mister.

149
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,303
-Your fashion is a little bit…
-What?

150
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,724
People might mistake you for a magician.

151
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,641
A magici…

152
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,185
Hey, I just met you today.

153
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,229
How can you say such harsh words to me?

154
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,315
I'm sorry if that hurt your feelings.

155
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,526
Look closely, then.

156
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,280
All right.

157
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,116
-What are you--
-Just watch.

158
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,076
Like this.

159
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,581
One. Two. Three.

160
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,375
-Mister.
-Four.

161
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,128
Ta-da.

162
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,922
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

163
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,923
A chicken.

164
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,677
-Yikes.
-Yikes?

165
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,639
What are you…

166
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,642
Wow.

167
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,269
I think you're right.

168
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,687
A magician.

169
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,397
Here, it's a gift.

170
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,191
Thank you.

171
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:57,443
Keep the chick--

172
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,695
Please leave now.

173
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,363
-Leave? Already?
-Yes.

174
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,200
If you show up at my house again,

175
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,659
I'm going to call the police.

176
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,869
Ah-yi!

177
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,331
I'm here!

178
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,211
Oh, are you Yoo-yi?
Look how big you are now!

179
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,759
And you are?

180
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,681
Oh. Are you here
to get the money they owe you too?

181
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,644
Yoo-yi, go back inside.

182
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,855
-Yeah, right. Yoo-yi, go inside.
-We can talk outside.

183
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,025
-Oh, okay. Whatever.
-Just go outside. Leave.

184
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,109
Let's talk outside.

185
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,330
How far are we going?
We can talk here, all right?

186
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,627
Oh, Ah-yi.

187
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,046
Your dad's making your life hard,
isn't he?

188
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
You can't solve anything by hiding him.

189
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,010
Where is your dad?

190
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,471
I don't know either.

191
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,431
You can't do this to me.

192
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,645
I used to give you pocket money
and thought of you as a daughter.

193
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,481
You can't be this rude
and lie to my face like this.

194
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,651
-Answer me. Where is your dad?
-Mister.

195
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,655
I'm the one
who wants to find him the most.

196
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,658
Not you.

197
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,831
Ah-yi.

198
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,168
When you're my age,

199
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:43,215
you know very clearly
what little punks like you are thinking.

200
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
Don't make this hard.

201
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,886
Answer me. Now.

202
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,762
Where is your dad? Answer me!

203
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,264
I said, answer me!

204
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,772
What's this now?

205
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,275
Aren't you also here for money?

206
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:04,862
Nope.

207
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,823
If you're here for money,
just talk about money.

208
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,036
Why ask about her dad,
when she doesn't even know where he is?

209
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,789
Talk about money?

210
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,625
Sure, I'd like that.

211
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,920
Let's do that. Are you going to pay off
their debt for them?

212
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,058
Oh, are you okay?

213
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,728
-My, my tailbone.
-Wait. Try to get up slowly.

214
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,023
Okay, one, two, three!

215
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,067
Wait. Slowly.

216
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,485
Are you okay?

217
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,950
Help me.

218
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,247
What do you want me to do?

219
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,712
If you're really a magician,
pay back our debt for us

220
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,340
and pull me out of this hell I'm in.

221
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,259
Then I'll believe you.

222
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,180
Annara sumanara.

223
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,063
Please make them

224
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,649
disappear.

225
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,777
Hey, guy in the hat. Get up.

226
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,529
Get up, you son of a bitch.

227
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,199
Hey. I know all of this girl's family,

228
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,077
and this is my first time
seeing your face.

229
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,580
Who are you? What can you do for her,
you son of a bitch?

230
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,709
I'll pay you back.

231
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,129
What?

232
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,340
How much?

233
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,970
However much you want. All of it.

234
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,687
-Money!
-Money.

235
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,856
Oh, my God.

236
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,274
What do you say?

237
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,443
Is this enough?

238
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,819
More than enough.

239
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,574
Could it be fake money, sir?

240
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,035
You can see the serial numbers.
They're real, idiot.

241
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:17,911
Do you

242
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,124
believe in magic?

243
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,043
Believe in what?

244
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,627
What's this?

245
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,547
Annara…

246
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,551
No, you shouldn't. Hey, that's fire. Shit.

247
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,469
…sumanara.

248
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,762
Hey, hold up.

249
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,472
Hey!

250
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,395
Mom.

251
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,483
I wish you could have seen it.

252
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,735
Money falling from the sky.

253
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,614
Can I think of this as a gift?

254
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,411
Can I believe that,
because I've lived such a hard life,

255
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,038
God sent me

256
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,461
a real magician?

257
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,525
-Money, it's money.
-It's money!

258
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,277
It's raining money!

259
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,490
-Pick them up!
-What is all this?

260
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,033
It keeps on falling!

261
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,536
-Oh my.
-This is all money!

262
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,913
FOR PROP USE ONLY

263
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,206
It's all money?

264
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,542
Oh my goodness!

265
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,169
Amazing!

266
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,339
-Dude. How much is all this?
-Amazing.

267
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,217
We won't have to make
house calls for a while.

268
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,135
Jackpot.

269
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,929
-Hey.
-Yes.

270
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,516
-Hey, this is fake.
-What?

271
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,601
They're props.

272
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,685
What?

273
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,728
They're fake.

274
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,897
It says it's a stage prop.

275
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,569
FOR PROP USE ONLY

276
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,783
Are you messing with us?
Do you think we're dumb?

277
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,953
You gotta be kidding me.

278
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,497
-What?
-Hey.

279
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,294
-Stop!
-Stay down!

280
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,216
-Answer me!
-Hey, stop.

281
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,759
Damn it.

282
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,140
Ah-yi. Call me as soon as
you get in touch with your dad.

283
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,850
That's your only shot to live.

284
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,186
Goddamnit.

285
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,687
Go.

286
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,274
Mister.

287
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,401
Are you okay, Mister?

288
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,083
See? I succeeded again, right?

289
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,922
I made them all disappear.

290
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,099
It's Ah-yi.

291
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:10,978
Your name.

292
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,487
Wow, that means you'll still be a child
even when you're all grown up.

293
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,825
You're the one

294
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,203
who's still a child,

295
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,580
even when you're all grown up.

296
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,547
Ah-yi.

297
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,302
Will you come to my performance stage?

298
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,930
I'll teach you magic.

299
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,310
No, I won't go.

300
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,228
Ever.

301
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,982
No, you're eventually going to come.

302
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,525
I told you before.

303
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,152
You're already

304
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,530
under my spell.

305
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,582
Go.

306
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,876
And…

307
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,717
don't ever come to see me again.

308
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:02,964
It feels like I could touch you
If you just believed

309
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,428
It feels like I'm almost there

310
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,891
It hurts because you seem so comfortable

311
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:19,523
Leaning back into sadness

312
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:27,739
I'm someone
Who's been in the dark for awhile

313
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,787
So I don't really need the light

314
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,624
I feel that we have no choice

315
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:43,630
But to live life

316
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,133
In our own way

317
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:53,515
You would understand me if you were me

318
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:02,149
All the things that I desperately want

319
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,904
Only make me sad

320
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,408
I only wish

321
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:17,873
For my day-to-day

322
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:22,627
To be steady and stable

323
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:28,758
Waiting always

324
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,681
Makes me tired

325
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:41,229
-A dream that will bloom someday
-A dream that will bloom right now

326
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,940
I must bury it in my heart

327
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:50,989
And live through today

328
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:06,922
Please understand

329
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,550
My words someday

330
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:17,599
Even if it's not today

331
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,036
Bye.

332
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,423
The magic show

333
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,384
is over.

334
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,056
The performance
that made my heart pound for a moment

335
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,142
has come to an end.

336
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,536
No one's heard from her
since she left to stay at a friend's home.

337
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,248
Have you seen Seo Ha-yoon
or do you know where she might be?

338
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,627
Ha-yoon's mom is very worried,

339
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,298
so tell me right away
if you hear anything.

340
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,384
Get ready for class.

341
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,468
-Okay.
-Okay.

342
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,481
NO WALK TODAY MEANS A RUN TOMORROW

343
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,276
You finished homework, right?

344
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,994
Are you ready for midterms?

345
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:01,911
Huh?

346
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,164
Oh, no.

347
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,374
-You?
-Me neither.

348
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,084
I have so much to do.

349
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,315
Do you need something?

350
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,067
Huh?

351
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,610
Oh…

352
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:35,904
No.

353
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,447
Okay.

354
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,082
Well,

355
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:51,086
if it's okay with you,
could I borrow one of these?

356
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,837
One that you're not using today.

357
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,674
I'm using all of them today.

358
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,427
You're going to look at all of this today?

359
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,179
Yeah.

360
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,015
Okay.

361
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,478
I'm going to the library later.

362
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,272
You can borrow one there.

363
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,486
-Hey, Kim So.
-Yeah?

364
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,946
You know today's the day.

365
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,409
Maybe we should go another day?
It looks like it's raining.

366
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,368
No way.

367
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,162
I mean, do we really have to go

368
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,790
to that creepy place on a day like this?

369
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,291
Who cares, huh?

370
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,335
The sky is all gloomy,

371
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,546
which fits the vibe of that theme park.

372
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,215
I might as well just give up.

373
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,761
All right, pay close attention.

374
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,304
Baek Ha-na, the YouTuber

375
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,517
will dig into every detail
of the mysterious,

376
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,686
handsome magician today.

377
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,107
Oh, the nerve.

378
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,653
Okay.

379
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,656
Let's go to the library together later.

380
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,992
Cool.

381
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,244
Okay.

382
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,459
Oh, it's not this one.

383
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,514
Gosh.

384
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,477
Hey, what if an actual ghost comes out?

385
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,478
Hello.

386
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,190
Is anyone here?

387
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,734
Hello?

388
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,030
Is no one here?

389
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,200
-I don't think anyone's here.
-Yeah.

390
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,535
Come on.

391
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,579
Hey, slow down.

392
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,539
Come on, here.

393
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,917
Oh, come on.

394
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,753
Whoa, look at this place.

395
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,672
-There's a room.
-Oh my goodness.

396
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,967
Hello?

397
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,012
Hey. Looks like that's a parrot
they use for the shows.

398
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,515
Oh my God.

399
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,725
Hey, let's make it talk.

400
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,733
Hey. What's your name?

401
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,573
Hey.

402
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,868
You should say hi when you see a person.

403
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,746
Hey, knock it off. It's not a person.

404
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,540
Look and learn.

405
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,210
Hello, welcome.

406
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,923
What are you doing?

407
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,843
Is this not it?

408
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,388
It'd be awesome if I could get
talking footage for the video.

409
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,439
Hey. Just say one thing.

410
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,482
Repeat after me.

411
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,985
-"Idiot."
-Oh my.

412
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,612
"Dumbass."

413
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,824
Boring.

414
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,159
-Looks like it doesn't talk.
-Come on.

415
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,245
That sucks.

416
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,666
Thanks.

417
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,131
You can look at this one too.

418
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:07,842
Oh…

419
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,678
Can I really?

420
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,222
What do you mean?

421
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,893
Are you looking down on me?

422
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,900
You think if I share this with you,
my ranking would be at risk?

423
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,195
-Because of you?
-No. That's not what I'm saying.

424
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,406
Man. Even the thought of that bugs me.

425
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,742
So take it.

426
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,702
EXPECTED PROBLEMS

427
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,120
Sorry.

428
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,082
I mean, thanks.

429
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,968
-Want to listen?
-Huh?

430
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:33,302
This…

431
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,964
It's a good time

432
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,052
To be together side by side

433
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,306
Not too fast

434
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,434
Not too hasty

435
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:29,567
And you're a good person

436
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,323
Even though I don't know you very well yet

437
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:40,828
You're a good person to me

438
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:46,167
So what I'm saying is

439
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,671
I want to know more about you

440
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,634
I'm more serious

441
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,845
Than you think right now

442
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:03,184
Oh, all of my nights are

443
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,270
Full of you

444
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:10,024
I can't

445
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:15,488
Stop this feeling anymore

446
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:20,535
I feel like the world is encouraging me

447
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,205
Isn't it dazzling?

448
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,919
Us, in this sunlight

449
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,381
And wind

450
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,551
Do you want to go?

451
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:41,264
Whatever, wherever that place may be

452
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,726
Do you want to go with me?

453
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:55,736
Il-deung.

454
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,077
-Il-deung.
-Huh?

455
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,537
What is it?

456
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,455
Oh.

457
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, sorry.

458
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,295
Aren't you going home?

459
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,631
Yeah. I should.

460
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,978
Why do you collect all this stuff?

461
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,648
Hey. Put it back where it was.

462
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,449
Wow.

463
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,664
Hey. Pick it up, hurry.

464
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,298
Oh my.

465
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,343
Are these notes on magic?

466
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,510
Awesome.

467
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,354
Mister.

468
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,814
Are you actually good at magic?

469
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,028
You have to practice really hard
to make tricks like that seem real, right?

470
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,409
You know,
magic is based on skill, isn't it?

471
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,204
There's no such thing as a trick.

472
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,499
I'm not a technician.

473
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,251
I'm a magician.

474
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,717
Come on.

475
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,552
Let me see it, then.

476
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,890
There's a rumor, you know.

477
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,103
That you can make people disappear,

478
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,773
and when you do the sawing-in-half trick,

479
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,776
you actually saw a person in half,

480
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,070
and put them together again.

481
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,322
It's funny, right?

482
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,411
Do you really want to see my magic?

483
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,081
-Yes.
-Yeah?

484
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
Do you want to try, then?

485
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,172
You can check for yourself if the rumor

486
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,510
is true or not.

487
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,980
-Okay.
-Okay.

488
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,442
Then,

489
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,195
what do you want to try first?

490
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,131
If you need more books,

491
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,301
do you want to borrow them tomorrow too,
at the library?

492
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,720
I can't tomorrow.

493
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,059
What about the day after?

494
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,105
I can't do that day either.

495
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,776
I'm working again.

496
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,944
You're so busy.

497
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,573
Are you free on the weekend, then?

498
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,116
Yeah.

499
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,786
Then let's date, starting this weekend.

500
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,123
Huh?

501
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,625
Huh?

502
00:39:56,477 --> 00:40:00,981
If we do start dating,

503
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,735
would your lack of financial worry

504
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,114
make up for my shortcomings?

505
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,284
Would I be able to tell you that

506
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,915
I secretly took the workbook you tossed
so I could study?

507
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,005
Well…

508
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,007
Hey.

509
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,218
Yeah.

510
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,848
This is all so sudden.
I don't know what to say.

511
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,018
It's not that I don't like you,

512
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,856
but I'm not in the best place
to date anyone at the moment.

513
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,691
My family…

514
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,111
I mean, for a lot of reasons.

515
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,904
So what I'm saying is…

516
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,782
Hey, come on. I'm joking.

517
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,828
You're making me feel embarrassed,
taking it so seriously.

518
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,376
You're going to be kicking yourself
later tonight thinking about this.

519
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,712
Out of shame.

520
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,548
Oh, right.

521
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,226
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

522
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,170
Oh, wait. Here.

523
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,130
Bye.

524
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,858
Do you think that shadows

525
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,945
follow actual objects?

526
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,791
Isn't that obvious?

527
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,670
Maybe it's not so obvious.

528
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,507
Look.

529
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,555
Wow.

530
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,515
That's pretty impressive.

531
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,476
Yeah? Now then.

532
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,063
What about this?

533
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,731
What is that?

534
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,085
Cool.

535
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,342
But you know,

536
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,262
even little kids know

537
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,223
that all of that is a trick.

538
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,727
Sometimes whether you believe or not

539
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,272
is more important
than whether it's real or not.

540
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,189
Like this.

541
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:40,492
Then

542
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,537
go ahead and stab it.

543
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,082
My shadow.

544
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,132
Are you crazy?

545
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:06,852
Do you…

546
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,232
believe in magic?

547
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,985
No. Not at all.

548
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,630
Now, your turn is up next.

549
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:42,304
Do you want to see if the rumors about me
are true or not?

550
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,610
Do you happen to know Seo Ha-yoon?

551
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,573
I hear she's missing.

552
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,911
Did you do something to her?

553
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,791
What the hell is she saying?

554
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:37,943
How do you know

555
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,822
Yoon Ah-yi?

556
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,101
I'll show you the magic next time.

557
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,646
Come on, don't be a killjoy.

558
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,064
Mister!

559
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,192
Oh, and

560
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,361
can you tell Ah-yi

561
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,989
that I'm waiting?

562
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,542
What did he just say?

563
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:37,920
Yoon Ah-yi?

564
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,967
GRAND PRIZE - NA IL-DEUNG

565
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,552
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE AWARD

566
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,275
-Then let's date, starting this weekend.
-Huh?

567
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,693
Huh?

568
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,655
Oh my God.

569
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,663
How can I face her at school tomorrow?

570
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,748
What am I going to do?

571
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,417
Jesus.

572
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,135
"Few people."
There isn't "a" preceding "few."

573
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,263
You have to interpret this

574
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,849
as "There are not many people like him."

575
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,935
-When did you get home, Dad?
-You were too focused to notice.

576
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,478
Yes, sorry.

577
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,732
You're the great Na Il-deung.
No need to be sorry about stuff like that.

ECONOMIC MAGAZINE

579
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,119
THE OLDEST SON
OF FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE NA IK-JUN

580
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,081
You can't make a family
into a first-class brand

581
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,584
if only one person is outstanding.

582
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,794
It also makes it more valuable.

583
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,255
You understand, right?

584
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,925
-I always keep it in mind.
-Good.

585
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,224
Oh. What are you doing here?

586
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,101
I'm here to encourage my son.

587
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,646
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

588
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,443
-Come on, don't distract him.
-All right.

589
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,612
What do you want when the test is over?

590
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,447
Ah-yi…

591
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,158
What?

592
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,994
Oh, iPad.

593
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,495
Mine is broken.

594
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,457
Oh, an iPad.
Okay, I'll order one right away.

595
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,188
What?

596
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,191
I told you, I didn't eat it.

597
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,568
Damn it.

598
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,030
It's a fact, everything to do with her
is weirdly unpleasant.

599
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,616
She likes money way too much,
and that bald-faced lie…

600
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,119
Damn it. It's bothering me.

601
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,787
But still.

602
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,792
What could possibly be the reason
for her to visit a sketchy man's place?

603
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,168
It's one of two reasons.

604
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,505
Money or love.

605
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,926
-What are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

606
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:18,390
Hey, there's like this weird magician
living in that closed theme park.

607
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,811
I think Yoon Ah-yi
has something to do with him.

608
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,444
What do you mean? You have to be clearer.

609
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,538
Maybe he's her sugar daddy.

610
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:48,295
It's all very suspicious.
It's so disturbing, right?

611
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,341
Yeah.

612
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,969
You're so disturbing.

613
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,599
I almost believed you.

614
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,393
I understand you don't like her,

615
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,645
but next time,
only talk about what you've seen.

616
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,403
Don't make things up.

617
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,534
Whatever.

618
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,418
Hey, Yoon Ah-yi.

619
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,463
Go visit the theme park if you have time.

620
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,758
The magician told me to tell you

621
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:41,473
that he's desperately waiting
for you to come.

622
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,319
Why are you putting me
in such an uncomfortable situation?

623
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,697
Why do I have to be misunderstood

624
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,408
because of you?

625
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,870
Misunderstood?

626
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,998
For example,
what kind of misunderstanding?

627
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,627
Why on earth

628
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,550
are you waiting for me?

629
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,970
Why? It's simple.

630
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,516
Because I like you.

631
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,522
What did you say?

632
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,152
Oh, well…

633
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,703
I just like you.

634
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:11,188
I'm sorry, but I don't have time
to joke around with you.

635
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,105
I'm not joking.

636
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,484
My life is already a mess,
even without your meddling.

637
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,031
I'll help you.

638
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,702
How are you going to help me?

639
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,496
With that fake money from before?

640
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:30,957
No.

641
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,210
I just

642
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,923
want this time,
where I have no control over anything,

643
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,383
to go by quickly.

644
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,387
That's what I want for now.

645
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,515
What you need now

646
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,062
is someone to listen to your story.

647
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,150
You think and think and think
only inside your own mind,

648
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,069
and never let it out.

649
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,698
No wonder your heart
gets heavier and heavier.

650
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,617
Am I wrong?

651
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,457
Who do you want it to be?

652
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,753
That someone you can open up to.

653
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,093
I'll send them for you.

654
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,181
What?

655
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,646
The texts you wrote.

656
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,441
She hasn't read them yet.

657
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,237
What are you talking about?

658
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,365
Do you…

659
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,369
believe in magic?

660
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,548
Give it back. What are you doing?

661
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,384
Give me back my phone!

662
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,370
Mom. Today is the first day of year two.

663
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,333
Maybe I am lucky like the teacher said.

664
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,004
I think it's going to be
another great school year.

665
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,382
So don't worry about me.

666
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,597
No way.

667
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,326
MESSAGES

668
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,371

READ

672
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,779
Why are you doing this?

673
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,783
Mister.

674
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,704
What are you?

675
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,124
Me?

676
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,754
I'm a magician.

677
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,801
You're lying. Nonsense! Liar!

678
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,803
My mom…

679
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,681
My mom is…

680
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,852
she's dead!

681
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,968
I just like you.

682
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,188
Sugar daddy.

683
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,192
It's all very suspicious.

684
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,878
Mom!

685
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,173
Mom…

686
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:22,183
Sometimes, there are goodbyes
that are harder to accept than death.

687
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,352
Mom…

688
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,525
It was less painful for me
to believe she was dead

689
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,112
than to admit that

690
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,156
she abandoned me.

691
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,832
MY FAMILY, DAD, MY MOM

692
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,835
DAD, MY MOM

693
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,133
It's not that

694
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:00,388
Mom is choosing to stay away.
It's that she can't come back.

695
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,439
Mom.

696
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,150
Did you really get my messages?

697
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,403
I know it doesn't make any sense,

698
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,614
but I keep regretting.

699
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,867
Did I ever

700
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,287
text you that I loved you?

701
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,429
What is this?

702
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,602
You told me
to talk about stuff I actually saw.

703
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,979
Oh, and can you tell Ah-yi

704
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,232
that I'm waiting for her?

705
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,158
I mean, good thing I got this on camera.

706
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,080
Hey. Does this remind you of anything?

707
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,084
Yeah.

708
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,045
Criminal law, article 307.

709
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:21,969
"A person who libels another person
with unnecessary fact or a false fact

710
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,764
can be sentenced up to two years in jail

711
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,351
or fined five million won."

712
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,441
So

713
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,528
you should be careful.

714
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,366
What the…

715
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,828
Is he showing off
that his dad's the chief prosecutor--

716
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,378
Wait, is he taking Yoon Ah-yi's side?

717
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,656
Is this something we can't talk about
in the classroom?

718
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,324
Yeah.

719
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,665
The teacher should be coming in soon.

720
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:39,964
Il-deung,

721
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,551
I'm thankful for everything, but--

722
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:44,802
Hey.

723
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,221
Yeah?

724
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,727
What do you think
the math midterm will be like?

725
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,814
I don't know.

726
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:02,487
I'd have to see the test
to know how difficult the problems are.

727
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,239
Why do you ask?

728
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,535
Can you…

729
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,414
not do well on the test?

730
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,752
So I can be first in all subjects.

731
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,882
What are you talking about?

732
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,470
I'll pay you.

733
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,435
To fail the test.

734
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:38,981
What?

735
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,404
Don't you…

736
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,285
need money?

737
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:10,002
