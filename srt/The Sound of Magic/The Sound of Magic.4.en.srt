My gosh.

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,230
Just say something, anything.
Make up an excuse if you have to.

4
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,816
Huh?

5
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,747
Yoon Ah-yi.
I think I need to talk to your parents.

6
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,582
Tell your mother…

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,168
who's not around.

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,838
-Bring your father.
-But I…

Mom.

11
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:16,534
My homeroom teacher told me
to bring Dad to school.

12
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:22,415
Because I'm still a minor,
there are things that require a guardian.

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,795
I don't think my teacher knows

14
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,340
that having a dad

15
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,302
doesn't necessarily mean
someone's taking care of me.

Will you really be able

Look who it is.

25
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,978
You're really busy these days, aren't you?

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,648
You see Na Il-deung at school,

27
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,775
and then you see
you-know-who after school.

28
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,653
You're here again?

29
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,698
Is that you-know-who
Ha-na mentioned inside?

30
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,951
I don't know either. I haven't checked.

31
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,662
Stop acting so innocent.

32
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,666
I saw you putting something
in there just now.

33
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,379
Were you trying
to leave the magician a note or something?

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,675
"Hey, I was waiting for you."

35
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,802
No, it's not like that.

36
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,262
Oh!

37
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,640
Hey, stop!

38
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,477
What?

39
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,027
It's empty. Why are you overreacting?

40
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,033
You just get more mysterious
the more I get to know you.

41
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:08,122
Hey. You're not in love
with the magician for real, are you?

42
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,794
I mean, sure,
I admit that he is pretty good-looking.

43
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,879
But still, is that really enough to--

44
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,381
Huh? She's…

45
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,883
Hey! Are you ignoring me?

46
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,554
-That little…
-I don't blame her.

47
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,306
Watch it.

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,479
Knock knock.

49
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,648
Mister?

50
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,693
Is anybody home?

51
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,862
Mr. Magician.

52
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,491
Is anybody here?

53
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,412
There's really nobody here.

54
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,623
Gosh, the dust.

55
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,793
I really don't like anything
about this place.

56
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:59,173
What could he possibly be doing all day,
in such a depressing place like this?

57
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,259
I know, right?

58
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,932
There's one way we can find out.

59
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,894
What are you doing? Are you done yet?

60
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,187
Just wait.

61
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,691
Seriously?
I'm only waiting for ten more seconds.

62
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,067
Okay, I told you I got it.

63
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,610
Seriously.

64
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,616
Ten, nine, eight,

65
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,078
seven, six…

66
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,081
Five.

67
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,422
Ha-na.

68
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,300
Come on. Five comes after six.

69
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,596
What are you up to?

70
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,641
We were just about to leave, weren't we?

71
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,648
You never finished
that magic show from last time.

72
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,277
We waited for a long time,
but now it's time for after-school class.

73
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,991
Promise me you'll show us
the rest of it at our next visit, okay?

74
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,743
Goodbye.

75
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,037
Wait.

76
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,917
I think…

77
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,469
you're hiding something.

78
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,275
It's nothing.

79
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,871
Shall we take a look
at what that nothing is?

80
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,488
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,409
It's so unique and pretty.
I couldn't help it.

82
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,412
Don't…

83
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,584
touch anything here without permission.

84
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,296
That's disrespectful to magic.

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,848
And sneaking around

86
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,018
is even more so.

87
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,316
You can go now.

88
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,944
Goodbye.

89
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,964
Seriously,
I thought my heart was going to explode.

90
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,967
I could have attached it for sure
if I just had one more minute.

91
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,472
Where in the world
did you learn to be so reckless?

92
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,852
Putting up hidden cameras is a crime.
I ought to report you to the police!

93
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,147
Oh, yeah? My accomplice Kim So-hee?

94
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,441
-Let's go.
-Hey, I didn't do anything.

95
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,985
-Yes, you did. You're an accomplice.
-No, I'm not.

96
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,513
BEST EDU ACADEMY
CSAT MOCK TEST: ENGLISH

97
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,238
Damn it.

98
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,526
He left his books all over the place.

99
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,286
What's this?

100
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes, hello.

101
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,382
Yes, I know he took a practice test.

102
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,927
Please, my Il-deung would never--

103
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,312
Yes, I understand.

104
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:26,811
At night when everyone is asleep

105
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:33,567
I sit by myself wide awake

106
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:40,950
Unable to let go of the day

107
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,454
That has already

108
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,250
Passed me by

109
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,547
Am I waiting for someone?

110
00:11:55,214 --> 00:12:01,303
Is there something
I still have left to do?

111
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,640
Or maybe

112
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,521
I'm reminiscing about that place

113
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:17,945
That I long to return to?

114
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:23,826
When I lay my head in your lap

115
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:30,124
Brush back my hair like you used to

116
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,586
When I was so very young

117
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,465
Even if I fall asleep

118
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:42,344
At the sweet touch of your hand

119
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,722
Let me stay there

120
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:50,269
For a while

121
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,731
Don't wake me up

122
00:12:53,814 --> 00:13:00,780
I will fall into a deep sleep

123
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,448
Oh my.

124
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,910
My Yoo-yi is such a talented singer.

125
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,620
Dad?

126
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,830
It's scratchy.

127
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,499
It's scratchy?

128
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,171
-Should my baby girl become a singer?
-I'd love that.

129
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,381
Daddy would love that too.

130
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,258
Oh, Ah-yi!

131
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
Dad.

132
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,268
Ah-yi.

133
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,983
Here.

134
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,444
You don't have to keep bringing more food.

135
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,785
Did Yong-pal come to visit
while I wasn't around?

136
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,331
I mean, a few times.

137
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,085
I see.

138
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,255
Things haven't been easy, have they?

139
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,301
I want to ask if he's back for good,

140
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,055
if the debt has been all paid off, but…

141
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:17,439
Wow, my Ah-yi is all grown up now. Right?

142
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,860
Thanks to someone.

143
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,417
Go on, eat.

144
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,545
-Dad.
-Yeah?

145
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,423
If you're free tomorrow,

146
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,551
can you drop by my school?

147
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,469
Your school? Why?

148
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,646
Right. It's not like I need
a specific reason to visit your school.

149
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,733
Sure, it'll be good
to check out your school

150
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,861
and meet your teachers too.
Of course, I can.

151
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,363
I'll do that.

152
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,159
Oh. Wait.

153
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,579
Just a second.

154
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,205
Yes, speaking.

155
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,003
What? Wait, no.
How can you suddenly do this to me?

156
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,004
Yoo-yi, eat.

157
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,093
If you just give me a few days,
I can take care of it.

158
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,604
RENT, FOOD, BILLS

159
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,862
BILLS

160
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,090
I just have to give it back. Yeah.

161
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,468
I was only briefly borrowing it.

162
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,555
Once the money returns
to Il-deung's account, bit by bit,

163
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,266
no one will think it's that big of a deal.

164
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,527
Ah-yi.

165
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,155
Where did Dad go?

166
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,449
-Dad?
-Yeah.

167
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,170
What are you doing?

168
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,439
COUNSELING OFFICE

169
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,901
So, is your father coming or not?

170
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,873
What do you expect me to do
if you sit silently like that?

171
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,669
Gosh.

172
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,091
Acting like this is
only going to make things worse.

173
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,218
That picture of Il-deung giving you money

174
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,471
has already reached
the principal's office,

175
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:39,058
and Il-deung's mother is threatening
to tell the anti-bullying committee!

176
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:54,948
Yoon Ah-yi!

177
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,418
Jesus Christ.

178
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
Seriously.

179
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,344
Yoon Ah-yi.

180
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,181
Hey, as your teacher,

181
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:23,143
I did everything I could
to respect your rights as a student,

182
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:28,982
and I did my best to be as fair
as possible while handling this situation.

183
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,276
Please remember that.

184
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,153
We made a deal!

185
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,906
A deal?

186
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,911
What deal?

187
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,584
Il-deung and you?

188
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,216
It was about the test scores.

189
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,617
-Hello.
-Oh, Ah-yi.

190
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,121
Yeah, well…

191
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,373
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

192
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,752
It's just something urgent came up.

193
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,004
I left without even
saying goodbye to my girl.

194
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,591
Oh, and about the money.

195
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,802
I'm going to make a lot of money

196
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,388
and pay you back double
the next time I come home.

197
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,308
I mean it. Trust me, okay?

198
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,228
And

199
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,564
I won't be able
to contact you for a while.

200
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,316
Don't worry about me.

201
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,278
Gosh.

202
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm leaving you with such a heavy burden.

203
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,869
I should be ashamed of myself.

204
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,997
Then can't you just not leave?

205
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Dad.

206
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,711
I'll work more shifts,

207
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,172
and I'll do whatever I can.

208
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,342
There's got to be a way
to work through this together.

209
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,345
Can you try to understand me a bit?

210
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,641
When I look at you and Yoo-yi,

211
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,937
I feel so sorry,
and my heart aches so much

212
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,273
that it's unbearable.

213
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,280
And it feels better
when you go and hide all by yourself?

214
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,033
How can that be possible?
It's not like that.

215
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,244
Well…

216
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,166
My Ah-yi is practically
all grown up now, right?

217
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,378
So you're going
to make it through this just fine.

218
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,050
How can you tell me
I can get through this just fine

219
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,221
when you're busy
running away all the time?

220
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,100
Why do you expect me
to act like a grown-up

221
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,312
when you're so cowardly yourself?

222
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,774
Ah-yi.

223
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,402
You're right.

224
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,488
I am all grown up.

225
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,826
I'm well beyond the age
of missing hugs from my parents.

226
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,787
But that's not the case for Yoo-Yi.

227
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,666
Dad, you're the one
who should take responsibility for her.

228
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,293
Not her sister, not me!

229
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,136
This is too much for me.

230
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,516
I'm scared,

231
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,227
exhausted,

232
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,232
and I'm sick of all this now.

233
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,161
I won't ask you to take care of me too.
I wouldn't even dream of it.

234
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,498
So, I'm begging you
not to run away all by yourself

235
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,876
and take Yoo-yi with you, right now!

236
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,047
I'm sorry.

237
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,886
I'm sorry for being a terrible father.

238
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,518
Hello? Dad?

239
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,957
An evening where the sunlight has left

240
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,836
After playing

241
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,843
A shadow standing all by itself

242
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,347
Cries for a while

243
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,809
Because it has lost its way

244
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:44,774
On a road that someone once showed it

245
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,571
Even as the stars

246
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,492
Are just beginning to nod off

247
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,829
She wakes up the sleepy night

248
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,999
With a shake

249
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,836
Asking for one small favor

250
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,840
Before it falls asleep

251
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:15,430
Asking it to light up this path

252
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,142
Is the girl

253
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:24,814
That I'd always hoped to be

254
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:31,863
Somewhere far off at the end of this road?

255
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,201
Do I have to make it

256
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,955
To the end of that long road

257
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,833
To become that girl

258
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,629
I had hoped to be?

259
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:55,053
The night then tells her

260
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,349
That she should get to bed

261
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,811
Good night

262
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,107
Childhood dreams

263
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,414
Through a finger-wide crack

264
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,418
In the window

265
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:33,883
A sense of longing
Slowly creeps its way in

266
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,471
When it reaches my lips

267
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,350
And I try to call its name

268
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:49,316
All it leaves are tears

269
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,068
This song

270
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:57,198
That we're dreaming of on this night

271
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:04,623
I hope that we'll cross
The darkness in the sky

272
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:12,339
To greet the happiest of mornings

273
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:20,347
And all of it will come true

274
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,021
The night then hugs her

275
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,317
And says she should go to bed

276
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,779
Good night

277
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,616
Childhood dreams

278
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,995
My past days

279
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,001
Goodbye

280
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,519
A special prize for good conduct
goes to Na Il-deung, from grade 2 class 1.

281
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,868
Hey, Il-deung! What are you doing? Go up!

282
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,879
A prize for what? Good conduct?

283
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,841
Maybe it's for being good
at turning in your homework?

284
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,968
Yeah.

285
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,930
We're presenting this award
to recognize his exemplary action

286
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:48,017
for helping his peers in need

287
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,771
with warm-hearted generosity.

288
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,942
Wait, so

289
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:58,737
Na Il-deung supported
Yoon Ah-yi out of his own pocket?

290
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,615
You sure she wasn't extorting him?

291
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,459
They might as well just

292
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,171
write it on Yoon Ah-yi's face
that she's living on welfare.

293
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
Poverty isn't anything

294
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,553
to be ashamed of.

295
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,926
I thought that getting out of poverty

296
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,804
was the most important step
to overcome the misery in my life.

297
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,516
But I was wrong.

298
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,978
Now I see
that this entire time it wasn't money

299
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,605
that was pushing me over the edge,

300
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,400
but the grown-ups.

301
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,326
I want to be a grown-up,

302
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:33,623
so immature adults
no longer have any control over my life.

303
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,919
I want to become a lousy grown-up,

304
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,548
just like them.

305
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,154
You wanted to talk to me?

306
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,162
Let's talk.

307
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,582
I'm sorry, but

308
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,460
let's talk later.

309
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,755
You keep avoiding me.

310
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,682
I know you probably
don't even want to look at me,

311
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,269
but I really mean it.
I have no idea what's going on either.

312
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,521
Why the hell is this all happening?

313
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:39,939
No.

314
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,567
I'm fine, really.

315
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,278
What's fine about it?

316
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,832
I'm the one who came up
with this crazy deal in the first place.

317
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,253
And I agreed,
which doesn't make me any better.

318
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,131
When you

319
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,093
asked me if I needed money,

320
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,931
I'll just think of it

321
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,602
as you taking pity on me,
out of the goodness of your heart.

322
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,480
Yoon Ah-yi.

323
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,111
Do you honestly mean that?

324
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,575
You should just curse me out.

325
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,287
Call me a loser and a cowardly bastard.

326
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,500
Just threaten to tell everyone the truth!

327
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,086
Or at least yell at me!

328
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,047
That way…

329
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,509
I'll feel a bit less pathetic.

330
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,969
I did tell the truth!

331
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,428
And

332
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,892
this is the result.

333
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,400
But you know what?

334
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,485
I'm really,

335
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:10,405
really okay.

336
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,119
I'm so frustrated with myself
that it's driving me crazy,

337
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,163
but I can't help but feel relieved.

338
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,086
It's honestly so utterly embarrassing,
and it makes me unbelievably angry.

339
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,088
But at least I didn't get expelled.

340
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,381
Come on. Expulsion?

341
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,634
-Getting expelled is nothing--
-For you, maybe!

342
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,512
All you need to do
is take the GED or study abroad.

343
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,764
But not for me.

344
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,101
If I don't graduate, that's it for me.
I don't have any other options.

345
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,229
Hey.

346
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,900
You have no idea how much I regretted it

347
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,696
after I told the teacher everything,
do you?

348
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,368
It turns out even honesty
is a luxury I can't afford.

349
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,292
But you're telling me to just curse
and yell at you without a thought?

350
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,753
What would that do for me?

351
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,465
I really

352
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,218
envy the fact
that you can just swear and yell

353
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,180
without considering the consequences.

354
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,432
-That's enough.
-Na Il-deung.

355
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,813
So stop acting like

356
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,611
you're so miserable in front of me.

357
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,784
It's honestly a little funny.

358
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,598
Where are you off to?

359
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,937
We have magic lessons today.

360
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,649
Let's see, what should we do today? Cards?

361
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,279
I want to stop learning magic.

362
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,448
All of a sudden? Why?

363
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,537
I think it'd be better
if I just picked up more shifts at work.

364
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,001
Oh… You liked learning magic, though.

365
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,174
What's the point of such brief joy
when you're starving?

366
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,386
I'd rather make another buck
and buy myself something nice to eat.

367
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,597
That's it?
That's your reason for quitting?

368
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,975
"That's it?"

369
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,816
What's so great about magic anyway?

370
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,529
What's the point of getting your hopes up
that it'll all work out,

371
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,032
only to be disappointed shortly after?

372
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,161
At least you get to smile,

373
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,123
even only for that moment.

374
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,713
-Mister.
-Yeah?

375
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:05,514
I'm asking you this one last time
with all seriousness.

376
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,978
There's a memory that I want to forget.

377
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,356
Can you erase that for me?

378
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:20,279
Or maybe you could turn back time
to before it ever happened.

379
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,783
No, I just want

380
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,828
about ten years to go by
in the blink of an eye. Can't you…

381
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
do that for me?

382
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,005
Okay. I'll do it.

383
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:40,967
Really?

384
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,891
Do you believe in…

385
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,069
Wait, you

386
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:05,741
don't honestly believe
this is possible, do you?

387
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,042
-I thought you were a real magician.
-Oh?

388
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,254
It's too early
to feel disappointed already.

389
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,089
I'm not disappointed.

390
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm just done with expectations.

391
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,344
I'll be going now.

392
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,473
Wait.

393
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:37,940
These are

394
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,320
the cards I used
when I first started magic.

395
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,031
I was going to give them to you
at our lesson today.

396
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,368
Here, take them. They're my gift to you.

397
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,833
What happened to your arm? Are you hurt?

398
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,590
It's nothing. Bye.

399
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,467
Here.

400
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,157
Kids don't do things
with consequences in mind.

401
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,745
I was worried she would try
to take Il-deung down with her.

402
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,082
It's a relief
that she has a little sense in her.

403
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,215
Yes, sir.

404
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,801
Thank you for your concern.

405
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,386
Good night.

406
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,853
You must be hungry.

407
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,565
TRASH BAG

408
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,318
I left them out so I could ask you
when you got home.

409
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,653
What should I do with them?

410
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,282
Toss them out.

411
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,285
All right.

412
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,454
Whatever my son says.

413
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,580
Thank you

414
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,792
for respecting my choices and decisions.

415
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,798
Of course, it's only picking
one of the answers

416
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,175
you've already decided for me.

417
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,596
What's with all this attitude?

418
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,474
Is it because of that Yoon Ah-yi?

419
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:38,978
Or this stuff?

420
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,820
Of course, you already know everything.

421
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,448
Yeah, and speaking of which,

422
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,743
do you even know how hard I'm trying?

423
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,205
Pouring everything
into college prep might not be enough.

424
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm worried you're wasting
your time on frivolous things.

425
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,127
Is everything other than studying useless?

426
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,795
Of course!

427
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,339
That Yoon Ah-yi, or whatever her name is,

428
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,258
dragged you into this whole mess

429
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,385
because you're weak
and let your guard down!

430
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,763
-You know it's my fault, come on!
-Enough!

431
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:22,104
Even this time we're spending arguing
with each other like this

432
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,189
is a waste!

433
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,446
What am I doing all of this for?

434
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,572
Son.

435
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,158
Having a dream is easy,

436
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,661
but not everyone gets
to make theirs come true.

437
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,623
Whatever it is
that you want to do right now,

438
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,208
whatever it is that you want,

439
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,044
you need to learn to give it up,
for your bright future.

440
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,754
You can't do that?

441
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,966
I don't understand it.

442
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,681
Me going to law school
and becoming a judge or a prosecutor,

443
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,061
honestly, that's yours and Dad's dream.

444
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,187
What?

445
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,314
So why do I have to…

446
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,069
give up anything for that?

447
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,114
Mom.

448
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,868
I'm asking because I'm genuinely curious.

449
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,915
Those dreams you're talking about,

450
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,877
is it so wrong to just not have one?

451
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,510
Do I have to live my life
just to make something of myself?

452
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,296
Holy crap!

453
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,426
Jeez. Scared the crap out of me.

454
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,150
Hey.

455
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,611
What are you looking at?

456
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,530
And what are you going to do about it?

457
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,743
What are you going to do?

458
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,627
Thief! Call the police.

459
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,212
Thief! Call the police.

460
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,008
Hey. Be quiet.

461
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,136
-Get her. Get the thief.
-Please, be quiet, please?

462
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,846
-Get her.
-Be quiet!

463
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,932
-Get the thief.
-Be quiet!

464
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,978
-Get her. Get this thief!
-Damn it.

465
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:11,148
Get the thief!

466
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,361
Yoo-yi.

467
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,574
I brought something yummy
to eat from work.

468
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,494
You're hiding again, aren't you?

469
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,375
No donuts for you, if you don't come out.

470
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,587
Where are you?

471
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,970
You're here, aren't you?

472
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,308
Huh?

473
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,531
You're the one
who should take responsibility for her.

474
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,241
Not her sister, not me!

475
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,994
So, I'm begging you
not to run away all by yourself

476
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,206
and take Yoo-yi with you, right now!

477
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,756
Yoo-yi.

478
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,344
Yoo-yi.

479
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,263
Yoo-yi.

480
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,309
Yoo-yi!

481
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,367
CSAT PRACTICE TEST

482
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,691
Yoo-yi!

483
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,997
Yoo-yi!

484
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,638
Yoo-yi.

485
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,848
Hey. Do you know what time it is--

486
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:51,600
Can I help you?

487
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,562
I'm sorry.

488
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,564
Sorry.

489
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,667
Isn't it too cold?

490
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,713
The path you're on.

491
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:42,442
Ma'am, have you seen Yoo-yi today?

492
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,279
Not today, I haven't.

493
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,990
Okay, thank you.

494
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,960
Hello?

495
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,629
Is this Yoo-yi's sister's number?

496
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,548
Yes, it is.

497
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,801
Oh, I'm sorry for calling so late.

498
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,387
I'm Yoo-yi's friend's mom,
Hui-jin's mother.

499
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,306
Yoo-yi said she was home alone,

500
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,391
so I planned to drop her off after dinner.

501
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,102
But they fell asleep
after playing together.

502
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,689
Is it okay if she sleeps here,
and I take her home tomorrow?

503
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,697
Hello?

504
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,534
-Hello?
-Yes.

505
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,287
Yes.

506
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,583
Thank you.

507
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,806
I knew I picked some good angles.

508
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,195
What is this?

509
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,282
What?

510
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,500
One time in literature class,

511
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,461
the teacher asked us

512
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,092
what our happiest memories
with our parents were.

513
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,763
And one kid said

514
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,561
that it was when his parents
were traveling abroad and not home.

515
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,690
The whole class
started laughing and clapping,

516
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,944
but I was the only one
who didn't get why that was so funny.

517
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,034
Because for me, I've only ever waited
for them to come home.

518
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,079
First my mom,

519
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,791
and now my dad.

520
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,131
Whenever things were hard,
I would say to myself over and over again,

521
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,845
"Let's not wait for them.
Let's not expect anything from them."

522
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,308
"The only person in the world
that you can rely on

523
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,853
is yourself, Yoon Ah-yi."

524
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,649
So that's why

525
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,196
you wanted to skip ahead
and become an adult.

526
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,159
You were tired
of the suffering and resentment.

527
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,663
Do you know…

528
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,503
what I kept saying to myself
while I was running around

529
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,255
looking for Yoo-yi?

530
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,055
Annara

531
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,849
sumanara.

532
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,201
Do you still want to travel to the future?

533
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,080
I'll send you there if you want.

534
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,254
I have to get going now.

535
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,923
Exams are coming up,
and I have a lot to do.

536
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,593
Thank you for everything.

537
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,806
You know how you said

538
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,063
you hate that your dad
is always running away?

539
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,318
Isn't that like your desire to skip over
the hard parts to go to the future?

540
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,206
Well, it's not like
that would ever happen anyway.

541
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,416
What if…

542
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,796
it really did happen?

543
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,968
Would you still want to run away?

544
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,902
Do you want to meet her?

545
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:19,821
Meet who?

546
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,201
That person you just mentioned.

547
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,206
The one and only person in the world
you can rely on.

548
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,430
Annara

549
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,558
sumanara.

550
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,531
What do you say?

551
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,784
Do you want to meet her?

552
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,693
By any chance,

553
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:25,572
is your name

554
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,284
Yoon Ah-yi?

555
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,370
How did you know?

556
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,666
I just

557
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,085
know.

558
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,966
What are you doing here?
Are you waiting for your mom?

559
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,304
How did you know that too?

560
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,726
I saw this.

561
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,730
This is a drawing of your mom, right?

562
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,237
I know it might be hard to believe,

563
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,408
but there isn't anything about you
that I don't know.

564
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,286
No way.

565
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,874
You really know everything?

566
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,543
Probably.

567
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:27,300
Then guess the thing
I want to know the most right now.

568
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,308
When your mom is coming back.

569
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,271
No.

570
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:44,484
If she forgot the promise
she made with you.

571
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,322
Liar! You don't know anything.

572
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,533
She promised you

573
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,913
she would take you
to see the ocean on your birthday, right?

574
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,170
That's a secret that only Mom and I know.

575
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,553
I also know

576
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,265
how you feel inside.

577
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,937
Then…

578
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,982
tell me everything.

579
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:31,239
Everything that I really want to know.

580
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,762
Close your eyes

581
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,432
and listen carefully.

582
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,663
Maybe it was too much

583
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:26,127
To ask for the world to embrace me

584
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:31,174
Is that child
Who would stomp her little feet

585
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,178
Doing well?

586
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:41,976
Did you manage to overcome

587
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,980
All of the longing
That you'd asked to leave you alone?

588
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,569
It's too hard to bear that burden alone

589
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:58,952
Even all of those painful dreams

590
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:06,251
All of the things we couldn't talk about

591
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,797
And this day we spent together

592
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,345
We'll fold it all into a white paper boat

593
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:23,184
And send it into tomorrow

594
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:28,982
When we meet again

595
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,987
After crossing the wide
And treacherous sea

596
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:40,785
I hope that my future self

597
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:46,958
Won't be as naive or weak as I am

598
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:50,128
And will tell me

599
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:56,593
That I'm happy

600
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,180
Goodbye for now

601
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,059
Until the day

602
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,647
We meet again

603
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,715
I don't have a mom either.

604
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:39,719
I mean, actually,

605
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,264
I'm still waiting for my mom.

606
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,183
Just like you.

607
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,729
To be honest, I don't have any money,

608
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,106
and that makes a lot of things very hard.

609
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,817
But you know what?

610
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,364
There's one thing
I want to tell you with certainty.

611
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,242
That I never gave up

612
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,663
and am still living every day, fighting.

613
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,335
Also,

614
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,423
I don't know how you feel about this…

615
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,390
but you and I are very similar.

616
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,939
So I think you're going to do just fine.

617
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:34,899
Whatever that may be.

618
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,909
Are you disappointed in me?

619
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,748
You saying that we're pretty similar…

620
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,003
makes me feel good.

621
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,132
I won't give up either. Just like you.

622
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,197
What was that?

623
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,239
You know.

624
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,367
That's time magic.

625
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,745
Don't you get it?

626
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,957
You were just comforted

627
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,211
by your future self.

628
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,723
Mister.

629
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:32,391
Yes?

630
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,815
Who are you…

631
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,153
really?

632
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,254
Hello.

633
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:05,216
Have you seen anyone
that looks like this around here?

634
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:11,806
"Vanishing."

635
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,563
"Appearance." Success!

636
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,356
Yes!

637
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,192
LOOKING FOR A MISSING PERSON
SEO HA-YOON

638
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,277
Excuse me.

639
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,822
I'm a police officer.
I have a question for you.

640
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,907
Have you seen
someone like this around here?

641
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,005
Have you seen them?

642
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,216
Why are you looking for this person?

643
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,720
He's a person of interest
in our investigation.

644
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,891
I don't know. I'm sorry.

645
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,350
Hey…

646
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,447
Why are the police looking for him?

647
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,419
Hey, Yoon Ah-yi.

648
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,089
Do you still hang out at that theme park?

649
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,801
Why do you ask?

650
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:32,970
Well,

651
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,266
I just wanted to know if you knew

652
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,603
what kind of person he is,
the man that lives there.

653
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,397
The magician?

654
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,233
Magician, my ass.

655
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,906
Seems like she has no idea.

656
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,957
Take a look at this when you're bored.
Oh, wait.

657
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,877
It might be a little too shocking,

658
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,339
so I suggest you hold on tight
to your sponsor's hand

659
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,883
and watch it together.

660
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,386
What is it?

661
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,180
Just take it already,
before I change my mind.

662
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:20,685
My head's on the verge of exploding

663
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:23,270
trying to decide
if I should take this to the police.

664
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,717
I'm real.

665
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,555
I'm a real magician.

666
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:24,173
