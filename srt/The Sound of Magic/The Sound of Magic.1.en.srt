1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,179
Have you heard the rumor?

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,139
What rumor?

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:20,478
You know that small theme park
on the hill in our town?

4
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,857
-Yeah. That place closed a long time ago.
-Yeah.

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,650
Rumor has it that

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,489
a very good-looking magician lives there.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,536
Really? Someone actually lives
in that dreary place?

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,789
And a good-looking magician at that?

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,333
Oh, and I also heard

10
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:47,464
that magician is totally insane.

11
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,423
That's right.

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,970
Did you hear
that the magician does real magic?

13
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,681
Real magic?

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,434
During the Sawing in Half trick,

15
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,605
he actually sawed--

16
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,326
In the trick
where he makes someone disappear,

17
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,535
the person

18
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,538
really went missing.

19
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,915
Really?

20
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:25,710
And

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,422
before starting a trick,

22
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,300
he always…

23
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,107
stares into the person's eyes

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,986
and asks,

25
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,698
"Do you…

26
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,621
believe…

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,545
-in magic?"
-…in magic?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,634
A story, hard to believe

29
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,805
A face you think
You've only seen in your dreams

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,641
A strange and amazing story

31
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,685
That you wait to hear

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,605
At least once in your life

33
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,066
I want to dance a dance

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,820
That's frightening but also enchanting

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,743
I want to go
Wherever the tangled road leads me

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,538
A road with no start or end

37
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,501
This is not a dream
This is your imagination

38
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,045
This is the darkness under the light

39
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,423
Mess it all up

40
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,009
Everything you've believed in

41
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:04,517
You're not in a dream
This is your imagination

42
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,228
Pinch yourself

43
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:12,025
Take a step to whichever direction

44
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,123
Yesterday has never

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,293
Once existed anywhere

46
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,759
The surprising true face of this world

47
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,733
That exists behind what's visible

48
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,780
This is not a dream
This is your imagination

49
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,407
This is the darkness under the light

50
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,409
Mess it all up

51
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,329
Everything you've believed in

52
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,020
I'm not dreaming

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,315
It just all seems different

54
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,402
This is not a dream

55
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,445
This is your imagination

56
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,531
This is the darkness under the light

57
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,284
Mess it all up

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,786
Everything you've believed in

59
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,751
You're not in a dream

60
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,670
This is your imagination

61
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,381
Pinch yourself

62
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:03,094
Take a step to whichever direction

63
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,036
JI CHANG-WOOK

64
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,496
CHOI SUNG-EUN

65
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,165
HWANG IN-YOUP

66
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,710
DIRECTOR: KIM SEONG-YOON

67
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,970
DO YOU… BELIEVE IN MAGIC?

68
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,111
Having a good time?

69
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,613
Seems like you are.

70
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,156
You're soon third years

71
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,326
and you're just chatting away,
not caring if I'm here or not.

72
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,705
What's going on here? What is it?

73
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,085
Oh no.

74
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,464
What, are you all scared
that I might be your homeroom teacher?

75
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,801
That's a relief.

76
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,846
That's right.
What you least expected is true.

77
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,474
-What?
-We're screwed.

78
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,813
Excited that the dean
is your homeroom teacher? All right.

79
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,982
I'm going to make sure
I nag you into college.

80
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,776
-Happy?
-No, we're not.

81
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,320
Okay, let's take attendance
since it's the first day.

82
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,238
"Kim So-hee."

83
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,659
What the…

84
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,969
Thanks.

85
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,444
"Baek Ha-na."

86
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,486
Present.

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,363
-"Seo Ha-yoon."
-Present.

88
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,699
Okay. "Yoon Ah-yi."

89
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,369
Yoon Ah-yi.

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,123
Is she not here?

91
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,088
On the first day.
Starting off great. Good God.

92
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,889
You're late!
Where are you crawling off to?

93
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,808
Stand there until I finish.

94
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,861
You stand there too!

95
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,784
NA IL-DEUNG

96
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,998
So you're Il-deung.

97
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,585
Na Il-deung,
the top student of the entire school.

98
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,588
I guess names really do matter.

99
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,757
Nice to meet you. My name is Dean.

100
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,928
Wow, seriously?

101
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,137
I'm joking.

102
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,807
Why aren't you laughing?
You can laugh at funny things.

103
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,059
Wow, so funny.

104
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,979
All right,
so you talked with the principal?

105
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,982
What did he say?

106
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,153
Well, he just told me
to keep up the good work.

107
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,073
Keep up the good work,

108
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,909
meaning continue being the top student.
What a kind remark!

109
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,662
You can't go any higher than the top.

110
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,455
All right, go sit in that empty seat.

111
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,794
You go sit too. Consider yourself lucky.

112
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,174
Making me start off my morning
by raising my voice.

113
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,510
A good morning leads to a good day.

114
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,220
No?

115
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,055
-Yes.
-Yes.

116
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,185
Mom. Today is the first day
of the second year of high school.

117
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,605
I missed the bus and ended up being late,

118
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,525
but I didn't get in trouble,
thanks to a classmate.

119
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,862
Maybe I am lucky like the teacher said.

120
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,448
A forest that has a lot of pine trees.

121
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:46,627
ONLY TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN EAT
PLEASE DO NOT WASTE FOOD

122
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,034
Oh, sorry.

123
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,472
Mom.

124
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,892
I think it's gonna be
another great school year.

125
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,019
So,

126
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,647
don't worry about me.

127
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,612
Just wear your vest today.

128
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,740
Hey, watch where you're going.

129
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,577
Today is not my day.

130
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,585
Hey, Na Il-deung.

131
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,088
Is your deskmate mute?

132
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,007
I don't know.
I haven't spoken with her yet.

133
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,801
No, I told you.

134
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:21,597
That girl might look like she's all weird,
but she gets good grades, right?

135
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,474
Why are you asking me that?

136
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,393
Oh, you don't know?

137
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:29,188
You're the top in every subject
but Ah-yi always beats you in math.

138
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,857
So I thought you'd know for sure.

139
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,319
For real? She doesn't look like it.

140
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,780
-Kim So-hee.
-Yeah?

141
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,492
You should try hard to lose weight
if you want to get into college.

142
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,452
What?

143
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,747
-That's good.
-Everyone, stop talking.

144
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,624
THE COLLEGE GATES ARE NARROW
BUT WE ARE SKINNY

145
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,961
Since when do grades
have to do with keeping in shape?

146
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,006
-What a world we live in.
-Why are you touching my leg? Jerk.

147
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,300
So, this is our class motto.

148
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,680
As I see it, none of you should have
a problem with this, except for Bo-hyeong.

149
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,889
It's terrible!

150
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,183
Why, is your conscience bothering you too?

151
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,104
Okay, the math teacher is in the bathroom,
so just wait a bit.

152
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,939
He's pooping. It'll be a bit.

153
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,983
-My gosh.
-Don't tell him I said that.

154
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,193
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

155
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,079
Where do you study math?

156
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,459
You mean, like an academy?

157
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,590
Why do you ask?

158
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,427
It doesn't make sense
that I'm not as good as you,

159
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,803
don't you think?

160
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,517
But it makes sense
if my math teacher is not as good

161
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,102
as yours.

162
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,354
That's why.

163
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,384
HIRING PART-TIME STAFF
HOURS NEGOTIABLE

164
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,822
Mom. I'm utilizing all my time to study,
even at my part-time job.

165
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,573
Even if I can't go to college,

166
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,201
I don't want to give up on my grades.

167
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,687
What are you doing?

168
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,732
Sorry? Oh, I just…

169
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,578
No need to be startled.

170
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,583
You have to throw out the food waste
separately, or we'll get fined.

171
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,585
Oh, right.

172
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,379
It won't happen again.

173
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,855
So? What do you think of the job?

174
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,481
Yes, it was fun.

175
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,610
You're better at this than you look.

176
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,404
It's a shame
that you're just working one day.

177
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,241
If you'll have me,
I can keep working here.

178
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,953
Can you start tomorrow?

179
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,415
-Yes.
-Yeah? That's great.

180
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,209
A kid that used to work here
suddenly quit.

181
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,878
I didn't know what to do.

182
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,757
Let's see. 48,000 won, right?

183
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,052
-Yes, 48,000 won.
-Here.

184
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,305
I'm giving you an extra 2,000 won.
I'll see you tomorrow.

185
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,558
Thank you.

186
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,520
See you tomorrow.

187
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,105
-Don't be late.
-Yes, sir.

188
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,751
Ten kilograms of rice,

189
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,378
ramyun,

190
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,421
eggs,

191
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,173
and

192
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,385
tights.

193
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,244
FIFTY THOUSAND WON

194
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,288
Do you

195
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,541
believe

196
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,710
in magic?

197
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,670
I'm so out of breath.

198
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,883
Ah-yi!

199
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,303
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,014
I'm so late. Were you scared?

201
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,932
You're the one who's scared, not me.

202
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:45,893
You got me.

203
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,482
It's just that I met this crazy person
on my way home.

204
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,155
Are you okay?

205
00:19:59,072 --> 00:19:59,907
Yeah.

206
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,078
By the way, is this a popular style
among high schoolers these days?

207
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,247
Huh? Is it a trend?

208
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,959
Oh, right.

209
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,879
My money.

210
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,007
My 50,000 won!

211
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,760
Did you lose your pay from your job?

212
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,512
Yeah.

213
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,393
You must be hungry.

214
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,396
Let me fix something up for you.

215
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,314
Come on.

216
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,089
Today's lunch at school was jajang rice.

217
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,300
Yeah? Was it good?

218
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,052
I had three bowls!

219
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,096
Really?

220
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,640
So I'm not hungry at all.

221
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,689
Still.

222
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,608
Ah-yi,

223
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,445
eating three times a day
over breakfast, lunch, and dinner

224
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,032
has the same amount of calories
as eating it all at once, right?

225
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:31,248
So it would be too much if I ate more.
Don't you think?

226
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,418
Oh, you.

227
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,421
I'm going to bed.

228
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,548
All right. Good night.

229
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,730
What is this?

230
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,906
Hey, are you home?
Come out here for a second.

231
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,824
Coming.

232
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,704
Hello.

233
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,583
I've been waiting forever
for you to pay your rent.

234
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you even know
how much you owe me at this point?

235
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,129
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,549
I'll pay you back soon. I promise.

237
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,261
My dad promised me
that he'll send me the money.

238
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,848
Please, I'm sick of hearing about
your father who doesn't even come home.

239
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,894
You. Are you really in touch
with your dad?

240
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,188
Yes, of course. I really am.

241
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,107
I have the call log right here,
just a second.

242
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:43,028
Whatever, I don't care
whether your dad is coming home or not.

243
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,364
You said you'd have it this week.

244
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,408
If you don't pay
at least a month's rent by this week,

245
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,911
I'm going to a realtor
and renting this place out.

246
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,204
I mean it!

247
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,081
I'm sorry.

248
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,502
No one else would be kind enough
to put up with something like this. Jesus.

249
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,669
Dear God!

250
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,969
That's all because of you, isn't it?

251
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,224
Because of me?

252
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,809
I mean,

253
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,603
you were staring so hard

254
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,648
that you poked holes in them.

255
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,820
I don't care.

256
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,323
It doesn't matter whether or not
she has holes in her tights.

257
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,328
So-hee, did I ever mention her tights?

258
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,663
Nope, you didn't.

259
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,874
What a creep.

260
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,709
Just go study.

261
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:22,627
Jeez.

262
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,254
You go study.

263
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:34,222
So let's say she fell down
on her way to school yesterday.

264
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,017
Why isn't she wearing new tights today?

265
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,271
Right? It's kind of weird, right?

266
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,023
Maybe

267
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,109
she doesn't have the money.

268
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,196
No way, that can't be it.
No one is that poor these…

269
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,991
Are they?

270
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,411
They don't even cost that much.

271
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,038
Hey.

272
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,500
Wanna do something fun?

273
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,046
No.

274
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,534
-She turned back and it wasn't a human.
-So scary.

275
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,510
Hey.

276
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,438
What is it, Ha-na? Did you lose something?

277
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,774
Huh? Yeah. Hey, Na Il-deung.

278
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,111
Did you by any chance see
a 50,000 won bill around here?

279
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,364
No.

280
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,079
I took it out to go to the store,
and I definitely went past here.

281
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,206
I think I dropped it.

282
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:11,963
But it's not here.

283
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,264
That's strange.

284
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,069
Where did it go?

285
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,535
It was on the ground.

286
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,706
I found it.

287
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,542
It's not like I stole it.

288
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,515
Well, it is what it is.

289
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,101
I'll just think I gave charity
to a person in need.

290
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,234
She's got a lot of nerve

291
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,362
for someone I caught
taking the money on camera.

292
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,031
Lower your voice. She's gonna hear you.

293
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,875
This money is not dirty.

294
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,752
What's dirty

295
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:35,839
is me.

296
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,842
It's easier when I think of it like that.

297
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,169
Wow, it's so pretty.

298
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,212
Just you wait.

299
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,506
When my toy company makes it big,

300
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,759
I'm going to build you a house,
just like this.

301
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,511
-And our family can live there, happily.
-Really?

302
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,014
Promise me, Dad.

303
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,225
I promise.

304
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,604
It's so pretty.

305
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,675
I always told myself

306
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,678
Not to cry

307
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:11,559
Even when I'm sad

308
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,980
Scared that someone might know

309
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,233
What I'm thinking

310
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,322
When it's all a lie

311
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,852
Someday in the future

312
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,730
Will I be happy
Like in a pretty fairy tale…

313
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,648
Ah-yi!

314
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:03,111
Will the smiles

315
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,238
Wiped out by pain

316
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:10,577
Come and hug me?

317
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:15,832
When that day comes

318
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,919
I wish I could see the love

319
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:25,300
That I have been so desperately
Searching for…

320
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,634
-Hey, sweetie!
-Dad!

321
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:32,307
Without having to fall asleep

322
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,476
May we be together

323
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,106
Every single day…

324
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,441
Oh, what is that?

325
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,568
I made all of it.

326
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:49,991
Closer than the sound of my own breath…

327
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,755
Mom…

328
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:15,975
Enduring was the easiest thing to do

329
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:22,315
Because I know that I can't have it

330
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
I wish someday

331
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,279
It will appear

332
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,325
In front of me

333
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,089
Please

334
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,396
Oh my goodness.

335
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,207
I need to find that 50,000 won bill.

336
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,070
Thanks for accepting my invitation.

337
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,623
I will pay you back

338
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,500
with the best magic show ever.

339
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,544
Ma'am.

340
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,967
Excuse me?

341
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,512
Huh? That's strange.

342
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,639
You came because of my invitation.

343
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:07,021
I'm sorry, but I crumpled it up
and threw it out right away.

344
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,439
Don't lie to me.

345
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,316
You're holding it in your hand

346
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,485
right now.

347
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,572
What? This…

348
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:25,039
I definitely threw this
in the trash yesterday.

349
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,208
You threw it away?

350
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:32,130
I think this is too important
to throw away.

351
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,509
Here.

352
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,817
You know.

353
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:00,449
You came back here
because I enchanted you with my magic.

354
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,661
No, I didn't.

355
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,498
My money that you took yesterday.

356
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,125
I came to get it back.

357
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,252
Oh, that money? Wait a second.

358
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
You mean this?

359
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,343
Ta-da.

360
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,184
It isn't funny.

361
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,645
It's not cool, and it's not amusing.

362
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,148
So stop fooling around,

363
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,816
and give me back my money.

364
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,027
Okay, well, I mean,

365
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,488
what would be so fun
about money disappearing, right?

366
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,448
Oh, then.

367
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,992
How about this?

368
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,249
Annara sumanara.

369
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,923
Here.

370
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,091
Take it.

371
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,728
Don't taunt me with money.

372
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,357
Why would I take this?

373
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,108
I…

374
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,614
am not a person
that takes other people's money.

375
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,744
I don't really care
about other people's money either, so

376
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,412
here.

377
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,539
Take it. It's your money.

378
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,964
Wait.

379
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,388
You're going to run away from me again,
aren't you?

380
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,351
Then you should probably

381
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,398
tie your shoes tightly.

382
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,111
And

383
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,282
look straight ahead while running

384
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,742
so you don't fall like yesterday.

385
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,712
That's cool.

386
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,592
Your bubble-patterned tights.

387
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,345
All right.

388
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,596
Let's eat, Yoo-yi.

389
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,767
-This is yours.
-Thank you!

390
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,397
-Yoo-yi.
-Yeah?

391
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,066
From now on, always leave space for dinner

392
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,902
even if lunch is jajang rice.

393
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,946
I started working again.

394
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:08,948
Okay!

395
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,830
RICE

396
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,207
-Ah-yi.
-Yeah?

397
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,376
We're rich, right?

398
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,301
Knock it off.

399
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,179
We're second years now, seriously.
Take it off. It's tacky.

400
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,222
I said take it off.

401
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,724
Oh, I'm sorry.

402
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,686
You don't want holes in your new tights.

403
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,609
Hey, wait for me!

404
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,336
You said this week for sure.

405
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,921
If it's not a month's rent,

406
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,216
I'm going to a realtor
and renting this place out. I mean it!

407
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,660
Hey. Can you help me with this problem?

408
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,704
-Oh. Yeah, sure.
-This one.

409
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,749
This one?

410
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,209
Yeah.

411
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,350
You really like math, don't you?

412
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,353
-Yeah.
-Why?

413
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,314
Is it because you're the best at it?

414
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,735
I told you.
You're not the best, your math teacher is.

415
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,655
It's just fun.

416
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,157
Are you serious?

417
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,454
With math, if you work on it,
you'll get the answer eventually.

418
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,292
So many problems in this world
have no answer,

419
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,419
no matter how hard you try.

420
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,507
Problems with no answer?

421
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,676
Yeah.

422
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,389
Money, my dad, and my exhausting life.

423
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,224
Things like that.

424
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,143
Oh, things like that.

425
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,603
Huh?

426
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,063
Environmental problems.

427
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,276
You know, like global warming.

428
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,279
Yeah.

429
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,784
But, you know,
technology is going to keep on advancing.

430
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,369
It's a temporary problem.

431
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,748
I don't believe there are problems
where you can never find the answer.

432
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,919
What about magic, then?

433
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,005
What?

434
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,298
Do you think

435
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,301
there are real magicians?

436
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,265
What are you, a child?

437
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,145
Solve it for me.

438
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,189
Sorry.

439
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,535
Bye.

440
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,580
Hey! Hang on.

441
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,666
Take this home to eat.

442
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,793
We can't sell this
after 30 minutes anyway.

443
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,712
-Can I, really?
-Yeah, take it.

444
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:37,925
Thank you.

445
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,678
-You have to eat it in 30 minutes.
-Okay.

446
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,437
Sir.

447
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,272
Yeah?

448
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,570
I have to tell you something.

449
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,375
My dad doesn't live with us.

450
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,714
No, the truth is, he can't come home.

451
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,718
The toy company he used to run
went bankrupt.

452
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,928
So he's running from creditors.

453
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,722
That's right.

454
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,225
Is there anyone around to look after you?

455
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,314
You don't have any other family?

456
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,235
I lost all contact with them.
A long time ago.

457
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,325
I feel bad about your situation.

458
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,496
But I mean, seriously,

459
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,916
you just started working,
and you want your payment in advance?

460
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,631
It's okay, sir. I…

461
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,093
It was rude of me to ask this of you.
I'm sorry.

462
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,725
Please, just forget what I said today.

463
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,352
Goodbye.

464
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,481
How much do you need?

465
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,026
I mean,

466
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,781
I do happen to have
some money I withdrew earlier.

467
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,035
Is 300,000 won enough?

468
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,125
Take it.

469
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,839
What can you do?
As an adult, I should help.

470
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,849
Mom.

471
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,728
I never knew
the word "adult" was so wonderful.

472
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,608
Well…

473
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,531
Thank you, sir.

474
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,200
Thank you so much.

475
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,327
I…

476
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,121
I'll work really hard, I promise.

477
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,998
Of course you should.

478
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,334
Yeah.

479
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,879
If I make it through
this difficult time in my life,

480
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,008
do you think I can become
a wonderful adult like him?

481
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,426
Gosh.

482
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,107
-Cheer up, okay?
-Okay.

483
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,613
You're so skinny.

484
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,159
You have to study and work too?

485
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,079
You're gonna pass out.

486
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,582
Do you want to eat something?

487
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,336
It's okay.

488
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,840
From now on,

489
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:09,177
you can think of me like your uncle, okay?

490
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,971
You can tell me anything.

491
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,016
Oh, you poor, young thing,
alone in this cruel world.

492
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,227
No.

493
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,652
Jeez.

494
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,697
You. My gosh.

495
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,657
What did you just do to me?

496
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,869
Did you hit me?

497
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,954
Huh?

498
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,956
You rude little bitch!

499
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,710
Seriously? How dare you hit an adult?

500
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,295
You're still wet behind the ears!

501
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh, my back.

502
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,048
What the…

503
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,759
You beggar piece of shit.

504
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,386
First you use my pity to take my money.

505
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,139
Now that you got the money,
you're done with me?

506
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,599
I can't even…

507
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,936
Kids these days
are such ungrateful little brats.

508
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,063
Come here. Hey.

509
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,858
You messed with the wrong person.
You better be ready for this.

510
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,611
You don't have money
for hospital bills or a settlement?

511
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,572
You're gonna go to jail.
Come on. Come with me.

512
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,449
Mom.

513
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,159
Help me.

514
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,288
Somebody, please help me.

515
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,040
Come with me.

516
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,338
Hey! Look at me, hey!

517
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,007
What the hell are you crying for?
Come with me.

518
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,634
I said, come with me.

519
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,315
Who are you?

520
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,693
Do you…

521
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:50,904
believe

522
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,615
in magic?

523
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,784
What the hell?

524
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,995
Do I believe in what?

525
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,288
What the… Get lost!

526
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,584
Huh?

527
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,131
Annara sumanara.

528
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,524
Ta-da.

529
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,822
He disappeared.

530
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,914
A magic trick
that makes someone disappear.

531
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,541
Success.

532
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,455
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

533
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,393
You know the closed theme park
on the hill in our neighborhood?

534
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,728
There's a magician there.

535
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,023
I've heard about him too.
I heard that he's insane.

536
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:50,941
Yeah.

537
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,070
When he saws someone in half,
he really cuts and puts them together.

538
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,448
And in the trick
where he makes someone disappear,

539
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,158
that person actually goes missing.

540
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,493
No way.

541
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,640
Here. Drink this.

542
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,602
-Thank you.
-How is it?

543
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,647
Good, right?

544
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,863
Mister.

545
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,239
Yeah?

546
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,950
I want to ask you something.

547
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,785
Okay.

548
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,496
How did you come to that hill yesterday?

549
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,123
Hill?

550
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,919
You cried for help. In your mind.

551
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,964
I was just

552
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,342
passing by

553
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,971
and heard you, incidentally.

554
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,687
What about my boss?

555
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,523
Boss?

556
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,734
Oh!

557
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,196
Oh, that man?

558
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,491
I don't know.

559
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,121
I got rid of him.

560
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,333
With magic.

561
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,751
What?

562
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,837
Oh, the truth is…

563
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,132
I just wanted to scare him, but

564
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,428
he actually disappeared.

565
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,722
To where?

566
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,435
I don't know.
He wouldn't be gone if I knew that.

567
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,146
Stop joking around and…

568
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,399
Did you…

569
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,861
kill him?

570
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,200
No. You didn't, right?

571
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,205
I saw it yesterday.
He just disappeared into thin air.

572
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,001
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

573
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,172
Look.

574
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,717
There are

575
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,264
two types of magic.

576
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,474
Magic that looks real

577
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,434
but is fake, and

578
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,396
magic that looks fake

579
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,563
but is real.

580
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,275
Then, what type of magic

581
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,277
do you think I do?

582
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,740
Mine

583
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,951
looks real,

584
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,245
and is!

585
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:05,760
Okay.

586
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,512
I'll admit.

587
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,389
Yeah, okay.

588
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,641
To be honest,

589
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,562
the success rate isn't 100% yet.

590
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,359
I'm going to go now.

591
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,279
I feel like I'm turning into an idiot

592
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,823
whenever I talk to you.

593
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,998
Anyway, thank you for yesterday.

594
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,847
Mister.

595
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,391
Yeah?

596
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:58,772
I'm telling you this
because you seem like an okay person.

597
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,360
Why don't you look for a job

598
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,821
that's more productive
and, like, meaningful?

599
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,451
I mean, you're probably living here
like this because you're well-off.

600
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,995
But a grown man like you,

601
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,790
pretending to be some lame magician

602
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,584
in a closed theme park…

603
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,925
I told you,

604
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:28,885
I'm real.

605
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,515
There's no such thing as real magic.

606
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,976
You used to believe

607
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,856
when you were little.

608
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,692
But I'm not little anymore.

609
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,531
Why are you so serious?

610
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,201
What's wrong with believing in
and liking stuff like

611
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,912
Santa Claus and magic,
even when you're a bit older?

612
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,172
You're the worst.

613
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,260
People like you,

614
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,848
who have no worries
or sense of responsibility.

615
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,435
Yet you're talking
about foolish, childish stuff

616
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:22,897
like Santa and magic. People like you…

617
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,697
No, I mean

618
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,995
people like my dad

619
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,459
are so pathetic.

620
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,713
Do you even know

621
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,675
how hard I struggle
to get through every single day?

622
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:05,690
Do you…

623
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,155
believe in magic?

624
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,785
Just stop it already.
How many times do I have to tell you?

625
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:19,704
I don't believe!

626
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,789
I don't believe in magic!

627
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,546
Annara…

628
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,387
sumanara.

629
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,228
Everything was always here

630
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,731
You couldn't see because you've forgotten

631
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:34,779
Your eyes sometimes deceive the world

632
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,283
Just because something is hidden

633
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,577
In the dark

634
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,540
Doesn't mean that it's gone

635
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:49,877
Turn on the lights

636
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,055
Choose the path not taken

637
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,642
No need to be afraid

638
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:11,441
Question everything that you're used to

639
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:14,736
Isn't it nice to see yourself

640
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,322
At the beginning?

641
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,908
You, without any scars

642
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:27,540
Or pain?

643
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,986
Fear is essentially

644
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:00,281
A shadow you grow within yourself

645
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,871
They are things
That may disappear in a second

646
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:12,168
Lift your head up when the road is blocked

647
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:17,256
Look at the sky

648
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,095
That doesn't need roads

649
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,557
Don't fall for the lies

650
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,061
That whisper and tell you to crouch

651
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:35,566
Those dead words of darkness

652
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,195
Must have hurt

653
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,739
But you are stronger now

654
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:47,912
Believe in yourself

655
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,008
Choose the way you want to go

656
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,554
You're already there

657
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:10,893
Pick the brightest smile and practice

658
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,689
Isn't it nice to see yourself

659
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,400
In this moment

660
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,987
Where no darkness

661
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:24,699
Can stop you

662
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:29,954
Now

663
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,315
The name of this performance is,

664
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,484
well…

665
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,068
Oh.

666
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,405
Magic

667
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,200
that makes you believe in magic

668
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,702
again.

669
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,288
What do you think?

670

Is it a success?

01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,011
Mom.

672
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:32,934
I couldn't say
that I didn't believe it because the view

673
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,394
was so real and beautiful.

674
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,316
Is this person in front of me

675
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,320
really a magician?
