1
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,967
Odo Island Airfield,
final days of World War II

2
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,240
Odo Island Navy Detachment

3
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:20,815
- Eijiro!
- Yes.

4
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,565
Engine normal.

5
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:25,436
Roger.

6
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,981
- Fully refueled.
- Roger.

7
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,926
Ensign Shikishima?

8
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:44,105
Tsukuba Naval Air Corps, Tachibana.
Remember me?

9
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:48,099
Of course.
I am greatly in your debt.

10
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:54,006
I'm amazed you were able to land that bucket of bolts...

11
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,576
on this Swiss cheese of a runway.

12
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:59,059
You haven't lost your touch.

13
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:04,487
In simulated dogfights, no,
but suddenly I'm a real kamikaze pilot.

14
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:10,138
Then be grateful for the down time.

15
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:13,961
But it's odd...

16
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,014
We've scoured your rig
and can't find anything wrong.

17
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,408
What are you implying?

18
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,011
I'm on your side.
We need more people like you.

19
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:05,019
Why obey an order to "die honorably"
when the outcome is already clear?

20
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,785
- Get the guns!
- Yes, sir!

21
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,722
- Enemy raid?
- I don't know!

22
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:08,350
- What is it?
- Something big!

23
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:10,331
A new Yankee weapon?

24
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,807
Taki! Taki!

25
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,470
- Light the beach!
- Roger!

26
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,946
Taki!

27
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:36,687
What in the hell?

28
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,148
It's Godzilla.

29
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,831
- What?
- A locals told me.

30
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,023
That comes from the deep,
Godzilla they call it.

31
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,551
G... G-Godzilla?

32
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,380
We're screwed. Take cover!

33
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:57,776
Take cover!

34
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,933
What the hell is it?

35
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,733
Nobody knows.

36
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,536
- Ensign Shikishima.
- Sir?

37
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,592
Can you reach your 20 mm gun?

38
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,735
You're our only gunner.
We're just mechanics.

39
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:26,301
But what if it only makes it angry?

40
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,153
A 20-mm gun can kill anything!

41
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,431
Hurry, before it gets too close.

42
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,502
Go! Now!

43
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,710
Go!

44
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,984
Hurry.

45
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:09,004
What's he doing in there?

46
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:18,240
Quick, shoot.

47
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:34,099
It's goming this way.

48
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,019
- What do we do, sir?
- Ammo!

49
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,276
Fetch the ammo!

50
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:46,935
You idiot! Don't shoot!

51
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,384
Cease fire!

52
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,752
Fall back! Fall back!

53
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,145
Retreat!

54
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,333
Sir Tachibana!

55
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,822
I lured it over. Shoot it dead.

56
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,127
You guys didn't deserve this.

57
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,083
Hey!

58
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,919
Everybody's dead!

59
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:20,413
They're all dead!

60
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:24,725
Because you didn't shoot!

61
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,359
Damn it!

62
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,000
You...

63
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,794
Hey!

64
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:45,041
REKLAMA

65
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,503
Tokyo, December 1945

66
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,941
Watch where you're stepping, man.

67
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:31,423
Is that you, Koichi?

68
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,484
Sumiko!

69
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,719
How is this possible?

70
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,866
Weren't you a kamikaze pilot?

71
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:50,499
You have the nerve to show your face?

72
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,513
You're a disgrace!

73
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:57,581
Look what happened because of cowards like you!

74
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,894
If you'd only done your job...

75
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,545
My children wouldn't have died.

76
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:16,877
Do you know if my parents survived?

77
00:12:23,237 --> 00:12:25,533
Everybody's dead.

78
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,042
This whole place was engulfed in flames.

79
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,827
Your folks, too.

80
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:41,398
My children met the same fate.

81
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,941
"My dearest son, Koichi..."

82
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,529
"Come back alive," right?

83
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,314
That's what you said.

84
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,949
Stop, thief!

85
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,776
Out of my way!

86
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,726
- Jdìte!
- Grab that woman!

87
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:31,557
- Please!
- What?

88
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,247
Get back here!

89
00:13:38,062 --> 00:13:39,423
What...

90
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:09,066
Wait!

91
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,126
Finally.
Where did you go?

92
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,315
It's your fault for sitting out in the open.

93
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,848
I'd be seen.

94
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,571
You've been here the whole time?

95
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,598
Yeah, waiting for you to get up and move.

96
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,965
I bet you're hungry.

97
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,413
Why didn't you just abandon her?

98
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,422
Hey!

99
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:44,768
And leave her in a place like that?

100
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:47,561
Stop joking.

101
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,306
Wait a minute!

102
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,788
Please don't follow me.

103
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,091
Are you going to leave us to die on the street?

104
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:01,352
I don't care.

105
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,831
After you're done, you're leaving.

106
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:13,746
Hear that?
He's so mean and scary.

107
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,770
Where's your husband?

108
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,950
Is he a soldier?

109
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,936
Do I look like I'd have a husband?

110
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,924
What?

111
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,172
Whose kid is she?

112
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,078
- Does it matter?
- Of course it does!

113
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,903
During the air raids...

114
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,310
her dying mother begged me to adopt her.

115
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:45,546
So you...

116
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,544
have no relation to that child?

117
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,303
Nope, so what?

118
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,664
What are you, stupid?

119
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:59,377
You're in no state to care for a baby.

120
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,409
You couldn't leave her either.

121
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:10,096
What's his name?

122
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,567
"Akiko"

123
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:18,386
Well, how about you?

124
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:21,830
Noriko.

125
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:29,630
Why do you dress like a vagrant?
By choice?

126
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:31,792
Well I'm no harlot.

127
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,649
Don't look insulted.

128
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:38,714
She had to find a way to survive
and no one blamed her.

129
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:45,704
What about family?

130
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:55,935
"Haru Shikishima" "Eiichiro Shikishima"

131
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:57,219
Your parents?

132
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:02,621
Yes.

133
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,754
They were killed in the air raids.

134
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,119
Then you and I are the same.

135
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,244
What?

136
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,625
No, you can't...

137
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:40,356
stay...

138
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,129
Hey!

139
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,215
What's the story?

140
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,351
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.

141
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,390
The mother and child you picked up.

142
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,632
Think you're some kind of saint?

143
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:10,392
No.

144
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,954
They just showed up.

145
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:17,601
If they're staying, you picked them up.

146
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,186
It's a bit late to play the hero.

147
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:29,588
Count me out.
I'm through caring.

148
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,497
Wait.

149
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,972
Is that girl able to breast feed?

150
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:46,928
No, she's not the child's mother.

151
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:48,954
Say what?

152
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:04,689
At this rate, she'll die of malnutrition.

153
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,310
Right?

154
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:12,185
So you found a child but you have
no idea how to care for it.

155
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:14,110
What were you thinking?

156
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,305
I don't know.

157
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,570
It's not for you.

158
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:30,217
Adults can survive on anything.

159
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,511
Use it to make rice gruel.

160
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,503
Well...

161
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:43,082
there goes my prized white rice.

162
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:46,088
What a nuisance, I swear.

163
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,193
March 1946

164
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:02,144
Damn it.
I'm soakind wet.

165
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:10,332
Have you found a job yet?

166
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,452
Well I did find something.

167
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,073
What's that?

168
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,922
Money's not bad, either.

169
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:24,481
Look. They even paid an advance
of 3,000 yen.

170
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,507
That's wonderful!

171
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:35,657
It must be a scam.
Like the rice you carried that got stolen.

172
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:37,987
It's nothing like that.

173
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:40,216
What makes you so sure?

174
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,212
It's government approved.

175
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,002
There's a reason why it pays well.

176
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,283
What reason?

177
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:53,661
During the war, both sides laid
thousands of mines in the sea.

178
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:55,915
This is a clean up job.

179
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:01,030
But the pay is extremely good because,
well...

180
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:08,231
it comes with a certain amount of risk.

181
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,413
What are you, crazy?
You just survived a war.

182
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,298
What else can I do?

183
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,504
At this rate, we'll starve.
Akiko's life depends on it.

184
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,754
I understand that but...

185
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:28,253
This brings in money.

186
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:32,561
With money,
we can even buy American powdered milk!

187
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:33,739
For that, I'd do...

188
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:36,666
I forbid you to die!

189
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:46,257
Don't worry. Just because it's
dangerous doesn't mean I'll die.

190
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,295
It's not like kamikaze pilots.

191
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:55,847
And besides...

192
00:21:56,185 --> 00:22:00,020
I'll be on a special boat made to evade mines.

193
00:22:04,597 --> 00:22:07,962
This is specially made?

194
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:24,518
Hey, are you our new sharpshooter?

195
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:25,594
I'm Shikishima.

196
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:26,789
Sailor?

197
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,966
Fighter pilot.

198
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:30,255
What? This guy's useless.

199
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,870
You're ex-airman?

200
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,629
Just a military castoff.
Worthless.

201
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,547
Disappointed?

202
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:38,836
Seeing this boat?

203
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,287
The US and imperial navies laid
60,000 mines off Japan's coasts.

204
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,335
All kinds. But the worst are
the American magnetic mine.

205
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:53,474
Any approaching boat made
of metal sets them off.

206
00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:57,479
Ah, hence the wood.

207
00:22:58,388 --> 00:22:59,902
The boy catches on fast.

208
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,166
We mostly handle moored mines.

209
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,732
But wood boats are the best
countermeasure.

210
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:09,829
I'm Noda.

211
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:14,912
I developed naval weapons
during the war.

212
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:17,674
Boat captain Akitsu, and Mizushima.

213
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:19,327
“The kid” and “Doc.”

214
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,714
Not fond of that nickname.

215
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,737
And I'm not a "kid."

216
00:23:23,768 --> 00:23:26,191
You're still green, so "Kid" it is.

217
00:23:26,192 --> 00:23:29,592
I know, I know.
I wasn't in the war.

218
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:34,302
This is the minesweeper Shinseimaru.
Paired with Kaishinmaru.

219
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,321
The mines rise up from the seabed
like balloons on strings.

220
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:43,294
Between our two boats,
is a cable with a cutter.

221
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,257
All we do is clip the mine wire...

222
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:48,412
and it floats to the surface.

223
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:50,634
Then we fire on it with this baby.

224
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:52,958
Okay?

225
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:55,145
Take a look.

226
00:24:05,683 --> 00:24:06,188
Well...

227
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,377
this one's a bit tricky.

228
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,500
May I give it a try?

229
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:12,557
Are you sure?

230
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:23,146
You have to estimate it's position
accounting for the movement.

231
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,240
Whoo-hoo!

232
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:33,970
Nice shot!

233
00:24:34,443 --> 00:24:36,533
Same with jet fighters.

234
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,691
Not that I saw any real action.

235
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,838
What?

236
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:45,445
You didn't? That makes me
and Shikishima equals.

237
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,931
Hardly. You can't fly a plane.

238
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:51,067
If I'd gone to war, I would've learned.

239
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,967
If only it had lasted longer.

240
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:59,295
You'd better not mean that.

241
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:03,240
No, sorry.

242
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,501
You idiot.

243
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:41,885
Fire! Fire! Fall back!

244
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,365
You all right?

245
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,086
Jeah.

246
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,301
Another bad dream?

247
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:18,372
Dream?

248
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,193
Right.

249
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:26,835
I was dreaming.

250
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,570
Or maybe...

251
00:26:36,818 --> 00:26:39,111
you're just a dream.

252
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,747
What's wrong with you?
Tell me.

253
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,201
This is Japan, right?

254
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,078
I returned alive, for sure, right?

255
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:49,626
- I returned alive!
- Stop!

256
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,460
Yes, I know.

257
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:13,313
I know.

258
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,650
I know.

259
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:23,152
July 1946 Bikini Atoll,
Operation Crossroads

260
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:25,538
Nice place you built here.

261
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:26,549
Shikishima.

262
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:27,829
Worth every saved penny.

263
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,299
Would you a drink?

264
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:36,879
Oh, why thank you.

265
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:41,408
May I take a photo?

266
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:45,957
- Please don't waste your film.
- Smile!

267
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,945
Don't move.

268
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:49,394
Got it.

269
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:53,707
- Thank you.
- Hey Doc.

270
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,628
No coveting now.

271
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:58,963
Of course not.
Noriko's married woman.

272
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,187
Please stop.

273
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,007
I'm not a wife.

274
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,387
What does that mean?

275
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:10,487
She just moved in on her own.

276
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:14,530
She had no place to go,
so I let her stay.

277
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,148
And the child?

278
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:20,292
She brought her, too.
But they aren't related.

279
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,931
Akiko was orphaned in an air raids.

280
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:28,733
- Wow, that's a beautiful story!
- No.

281
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:31,546
It just sort of happened.

282
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:34,578
Daddy.

283
00:29:36,904 --> 00:29:39,195
- Akiko.
- Yes?

284
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:42,834
I told you. I'm not your father.

285
00:29:45,699 --> 00:29:46,827
Shikishima.

286
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,910
- Don't say that.
- He's right.

287
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:54,896
Fate has brought you together as a family.

288
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:56,817
Accept it. Embrace it.

289
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,355
Make them happy!

290
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:01,737
Enough!

291
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,196
I don't want that.

292
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:11,375
Why not?

293
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:21,587
March 1947

294
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,439
Welcome home.
I just returned myself.

295
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:31,629
What are you wearing?

296
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:36,347
How does it look?

297
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:39,111
I got a desk job in Ginza.

298
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,313
But don't I give you enough money?

299
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:51,480
It's time I stood on my own two feet.

300
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:56,164
At this rate,
you'll never find a wife.

301
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:03,612
Have you seen how fast Ginza
is rebuilding?

302
00:31:04,657 --> 00:31:05,735
This is so sudden.

303
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:08,599
Not for me, it isn't.

304
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:11,221
What about Akiko?

305
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,800
What will you do with Akiko
while you are away at work?

306
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:21,440
Sumiko has promised to look after her.

307
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:27,640
She was very excited,
boasting she'd raised three kids already.

308
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,774
In that case,
I suppose it's all right.

309
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:37,785
Thanks. I'll go get Akiko now.

310
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:22,792
The colossal sea creature
is projected on a course...

311
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:27,207
to reach the Japanese
archipelago within a few weeks.

312
00:32:29,298 --> 00:32:33,139
General Douglas MacArthur
stated with regret...

313
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:38,430
that recent Soviet movements prevent US military assistance...

314
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:41,126
but called upon Japan...

315
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:45,406
to begin strengthening its security forces.

316
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:51,843
May 1947
near the Ogasawara Islands

317
00:32:58,821 --> 00:32:59,965
What did this?

318
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:03,066
A giant shark?

319
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,324
Or a whale?

320
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,525
No shark or whale could do that.

321
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,019
A new Soviet weapon?

322
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,007
That's not weapon damage.

323
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:14,693
Then what could it be?

324
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,961
- An enormous creature.
- Like what?

325
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:21,113
Just admit you have no clue.

326
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:24,280
I was skeptical until I saw this.

327
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:27,819
Godzilla.

328
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,729
Look there!

329
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:36,885
Floating deep sea fish.

330
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,547
Just like on Odo Island.

331
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:42,108
What did you see there?

332
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,220
It was like a prehistoric dinosaur
turned monster.

333
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:50,668
The local inhabitants called it "Godzilla."

334
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,387
Godzilla?

335
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,667
Nonsense. You were half asleep
and saw an enemy tank.

336
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,273
Believe me or not,
something wiped out...

337
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:03,306
the entire garrison on Odo.

338
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,362
Was?

339
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,362
I thought the Americans did that.

340
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,922
Odo was never targeted by
US island-hopping forces.

341
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:17,966
It was a repair base for kamikaze planes.

342
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:20,494
Does that mean...

343
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:23,426
you were a kamikaze pilot?

344
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:32,458
If this is the Godzilla I saw...

345
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:36,941
it must have grown much larger
and more powerful.

346
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,523
Hold on a second.

347
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:48,365
Why were we called out here to begin with?

348
00:34:49,276 --> 00:34:53,353
They don't expect us to fight that in this boat!

349
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:54,970
Yes, they do.

350
00:34:55,443 --> 00:34:58,711
We obviously don't stand a chance!

351
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:03,261
That's US warship!
What can we do in this little rig?

352
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,485
Stall for time.

353
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:07,507
Stall?

354
00:35:07,913 --> 00:35:10,911
The Takao is coming from Singapore.

355
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:13,338
The heavy cruiser?

356
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:16,842
Rather that scuttle it,
it's being returned.

357
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:20,044
That's good news!
The Takao's a beast!

358
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:24,391
So we've been ordered to stall for time.

359
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:28,385
Why can't the US handle it?
It's their ship.

360
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:31,620
They're worried about the Soviets.

361
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,025
Any military maneuvers would raise alarms.

362
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:38,664
They prefer we handle the small stuff.

363
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:42,506
This isn't small stuff,
and all we've got is a 13 mm gun.

364
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:46,280
I was told to make use of recovered mines.

365
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:51,167
Ah, now I see!
This is why they called us out here.

366
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:55,683
Plus our main weapon has to be
locally scavenged?

367
00:35:55,818 --> 00:35:59,694
Nor are we allowed to talk about it to anyone.

368
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,962
There's it is.
Their favorite gag order.

369
00:36:04,177 --> 00:36:06,501
This country never changes.

370
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:09,163
Perhaps it can't.

371
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,915
Take a breather.

372
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:23,871
Thank you.

373
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:26,524
Don't push yourself too hard.

374
00:36:27,817 --> 00:36:30,503
I can't help it. This is Godzilla.

375
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:37,508
I hear you.
When I start remembering the war...

376
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,909
I can't sleep sometimes.

377
00:36:41,896 --> 00:36:43,800
I have to avenge them.

378
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:45,738
But at the same time...

379
00:36:46,793 --> 00:36:49,071
I'm terrified of that thing.

380
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:59,154
We'll need more than a pair of those.

381
00:37:05,294 --> 00:37:06,415
What is it?

382
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:29,200
There are way more of these fish
than I saw off Odo.

383
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:34,965
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

384
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:36,597
Godzilla's coming!

385
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,604
Sound the alarm!

386
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,175
So it's coming, huh?

387
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:45,269
Hey kid!
Prepare to drop the mines!

388
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,105
- Roger!
- Man the gun!

389
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:49,860
We can't fight it on this!

390
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,411
- We can still flee!
- Agreed.

391
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:55,199
- Doc, stand aft and report!
- Captain!

392
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,104
Kashinmaru, do you copy?

393
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:00,539
Get ready to land a big one!

394
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:03,498
We're taking all the credit for victory.

395
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,062
- You idiot.
- Captain!

396
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:08,020
If we run, Takao will never catch up.

397
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,741
And the monster heards for Tokyo.

398
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:14,516
I don't want to see it in flames again.

399
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:16,896
But this boat is no math for it!

400
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:19,787
I thought you hated government orders.

401
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:23,137
With a passion.
But you know what?

402
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:26,045
Somebody's got to do it.

403
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:45,616
Okay, never mind!

404
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:51,187
Doc, the engine!

405
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,064
I'm working on it!

406
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,220
Shikishima!

407
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:57,145
Shikishima!

408
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,797
Hurry! Over here!

409
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:03,878
- Captain!
- I know!

410
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:05,919
- Full throttle!
- Right!

411
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:27,820
Drop the mine!

412
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:31,445
We'll never make it!

413
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,703
So try anything!

414
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:54,602
Now, Kid!

415
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,268
Here goes!

416
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,290
Did we get it?

417
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,112
No, we did not!

418
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,731
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...

419
00:40:14,106 --> 00:40:15,363
Shikishima, the gun!

420
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:16,315
Roger!

421
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:25,702
Shikishima!

422
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:38,590
Completely ineffective!

423
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,869
The mouth! What about it the mouth?

424
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:52,126
Reel! Reel! Reel!

425
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:53,351
Drop it!

426
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:02,719
Mizushima, now!

427
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:03,739
Right!

428
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:13,500
What? No?

429
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:16,900
No!

430
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:31,405
Get down!

431
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,704
Did we get it?

432
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:04,886
No!

433
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:31,769
Takao!

434
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,435
They made it!

435
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:01,951
Oh no!

436
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:41,536
Is it down?

437
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:53,286
What's that?

438
00:44:54,314 --> 00:44:55,810
You're finally awake.

439
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,245
Where am I?

440
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:03,530
A Yokosuka hospital.
We were airlifted here.

441
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,879
What of Kaishinmaru and Takao?

442
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:15,755
Godzilla.

443
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:19,020
What happened to it?

444
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:21,911
Whereabouts unknown.

445
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,264
It was headed for Tokyo.
We need to sound the evacuation.

446
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:29,970
The government is not telling the public.

447
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:31,944
Why? We must hurry!

448
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,834
To prevent mayhem and confusion.

449
00:45:34,937 --> 00:45:39,112
Are you kidding me?
We need to begin evacuating now!

450
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,669
No one will take responsibility...

451
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:43,608
for the chaos.

452
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:46,839
Information control is Japan's specialty.

453
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:57,585
Tell me what happened.

454
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,041
It's got nothing to do with you.

455
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,785
What is it that torments you so badly?

456
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,348
You took me in, saved me,
and we've been together since.

457
00:46:13,961 --> 00:46:17,939
But you won't let me into any part of your life.

458
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:27,291
If you're carrying some burden...

459
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:30,862
I wish you'd share it with me.

460
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,006
I'm...

461
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:47,237
someone...

462
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,646
who fled my duty...

463
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,768
as a Kamikaze pilot.

464
00:47:06,503 --> 00:47:07,421
What?

465
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:09,631
On the day of my sortie...

466
00:47:12,489 --> 00:47:14,970
I pretended my plane was faulty.

467
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:19,018
And made a detour...

468
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,282
landing on Odo Island.

469
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,174
These are photos...

470
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:41,721
belonging to the mechanics there.

471
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,598
They all perished.

472
00:48:00,723 --> 00:48:01,878
That night...

473
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:06,912
a dinosaur-like monster came ashore.

474
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:11,469
I was asked...

475
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:15,134
to shoot it with the gun on my fighter.

476
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:19,360
But I froze up...

477
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:26,557
and ran again.

478
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:30,999
When I came to the next day...

479
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:36,380
I found them all dead.
People longing to see their families!

480
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,571
The monster...

481
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:47,061
was called Godzilla.

482
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:54,341
The other day, it reappeared.

483
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:58,733
And once again...

484
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:03,256
I couldn't do anything.

485
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,838
I'm someone...

486
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,900
who wasn't supposed to live.

487
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:25,807
Listen to me.

488
00:49:28,152 --> 00:49:32,311
Everyone who survived the war
is meant to live.

489
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,348
- How do you know?
- I just do!

490
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:40,037
As flames took passed my parents,
they ordered me to live.

491
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:44,924
So whatever happens next,
I know I must survive!

492
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:47,796
That's kept me going.

493
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:01,185
I can't.

494
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:07,920
They beckon to me in my dreams every night.

495
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:10,298
“Hurry and come,” they say.

496
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:14,045
"Why are you still cheating death?"

497
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:18,370
It's just a dream, ghosts you created.

498
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:19,938
Maybe it's an illusion.

499
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:24,660
What if I'm really dead already?

500
00:50:26,427 --> 00:50:28,474
I died long ago on that island...

501
00:50:28,903 --> 00:50:29,959
and lie rotting.

502
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:37,190
You and Akiko are just the last
dream of a dead man.

503
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:39,699
That must be it! It has to be!

504
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:41,482
You are alive!

505
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,987
You are alive, Koichi.

506
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,269
Can't you feel it?

507
00:51:03,175 --> 00:51:04,166
REKLAMA

508
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:39,311
Okay, hold the spoon.

509
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:42,811
Gently, gently.

510
00:51:43,076 --> 00:51:44,991
- Grip it firmly.
- Okay.

511
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:50,504
Good, now stir the broth.
You're doing great!

512
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:54,103
- There, it's done!
- Yeah!

513
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,768
I addeds your favorite, radish.

514
00:51:57,802 --> 00:52:00,013
- Radish!
- Taste it for me.

515
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,258
- Okay.
- Let's do it?

516
00:52:04,669 --> 00:52:06,914
First the soup, then radish.

517
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:20,417
Can I...

518
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,809
put this all to rest?

519
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,492
I'd like to try to live again.

520
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,574
Is that what I think it is?

521
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:57,512
Hurry and report it.

522
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,856
Hurry!

523
00:53:00,122 --> 00:53:01,177
Yes, Sir!

524
00:53:20,923 --> 00:53:25,642
Patrols report the Creature is
heading east towards Tokyo Bay.

525
00:53:25,826 --> 00:53:27,806
Is it close then?

526
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:31,751
- What is it?
- I don't believe it.

527
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:33,269
Is it here?

528
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:35,845
- Is that really a living thing?
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:53:38,141 --> 00:53:43,456
This is Tokyo Bay Defense,
requesting permission to detonate Zone 4!

530
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,536
It's almost here.

531
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:51,264
Entering Zone 4!

532
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:53,493
- Now!
- Detonate!

533
00:53:56,713 --> 00:53:57,504
Status?

534
00:53:58,627 --> 00:53:59,354
No good.

535
00:53:59,585 --> 00:54:01,070
It had no effect!

536
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:05,198
Blockade breached!
It's heading t Shinagawa!

537
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:07,409
And it is gargantuan!

538
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,541
Thank.

539
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:30,043
This is an amergency news report!

540
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:34,500
A giant sea creature has come ashore near Ginza.

541
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:39,188
Those near Ginza,
follow police instructions and evacuate.

542
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:40,757
This is not a hoax.

543
00:54:40,758 --> 00:54:41,451
Ginza!

544
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:41,948
People nearby

545
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:50,794
Are you hurt? You Okay?

546
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,528
What's going on?

547
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,014
What just happened?

548
00:55:44,448 --> 00:55:47,154
Is that... Godzilla?

549
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:08,310
It's a scene that defies belief,
a giant creature on the loose...

550
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:11,117
trampling Ginza underfoot!

551
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:15,111
Tearing whole buildings apart!

552
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:19,339
The Nippon Theater, beloved icon of the people...

553
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:21,748
is crumbling before our very eyes!

554
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:27,592
The Ginza survived the air raids
but not this! This monster...

555
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:29,870
has turned it to rubble!

556
00:57:29,937 --> 00:57:33,766
And now the monster is coming this way!

557
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:38,950
I can see its enormous head
passing in front of us!

558
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:41,723
It's dangerously close!

559
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:06,354
Move!

560
00:58:14,675 --> 00:58:15,896
Get up!

561
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:19,197
- Koichi!
- Do you want to live? Come on!

562
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:03,639
Did they get it?

563
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:46,957
This is...

564
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:49,202
the same as before.

565
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:43,284
Noriko.

566
01:00:45,728 --> 01:00:46,883
Noriko!

567
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,548
N-nori...

568
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:27,997
Damage wreaked by the giant creature...

569
01:02:28,196 --> 01:02:31,102
includes some 30,000 killed and injured...

570
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:34,123
and 20,000 homes and buildings destroyed.

571
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:39,273
Recovery operations are underway,
but the path the creature took...

572
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:42,872
carries risk of radiation that
is impeding progress.

573
01:02:43,269 --> 01:02:48,518
Police have cordoned off central Ginza
to collect shards of the creature...

574
01:02:49,014 --> 01:02:54,362
which are of unknown composition
and potentially hazardous.

575
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:11,101
I'm so sorry.

576
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:17,787
What now for Akiko?

577
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,641
We pull together, that's what.

578
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:24,325
Hey Akiko.

579
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:32,348
You loke playing with me when
Dad's away at work, right?

580
01:03:32,844 --> 01:03:34,593
Where's Mommy?

581
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:45,752
Mommy had to go away for a little while for work.

582
01:03:46,414 --> 01:03:48,560
But you'll have me with you, okay?

583
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:37,838
You can't forgive me, Is that it?

584
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,415
It's my fault...

585
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:49,476
for thinking I could dream again.

586
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,258
Mr. Shikishima.

587
01:05:06,662 --> 01:05:12,340
There's actually a strategy being hatched
to defeat Godzilla...

588
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,477
led by private citizens.

589
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:18,944
It lacks any real basis for viability, but...

590
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:23,533
will you take part?

591
01:05:30,203 --> 01:05:33,537
<b>"Special Disaster Countermeasure Hearing"</b>

592
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,072
- Wait, everyone here is...
- Yes.

593
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,846
- Ex-navy personnel.
- You're informed.

594
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:46,431
Really?

595
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:09,179
I'm ex-"Yukikaze" Destroyer Captain Hotta.

596
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:12,943
As you all know, Tokyo again faces...

597
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:17,499
an unprecedented crisis,
this time, a monster attack.

598
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:22,914
But we have no defense apparatus
of our own to protect our people.

599
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:28,461
What's more, any GHQ-led military
action runs the risk of escalating

600
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,442
US-Soviet tensions.

601
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:36,897
In short, we must confront the monsters
with our strengths as private citizens.

602
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,057
This is why we've gathered you here.

603
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:45,019
But we've negotiated the use of four destroyers...

604
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,056
originally slated for handover to the UN.

605
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:51,193
Are you saying...

606
01:06:51,954 --> 01:06:53,996
you want us back on navy ships?

607
01:06:54,396 --> 01:06:56,443
I saw what it did in Ginza.

608
01:06:56,906 --> 01:06:58,523
There's no way to defeat it.

609
01:06:58,755 --> 01:07:02,849
Especially from boats that have been disarmed.

610
01:07:03,048 --> 01:07:04,334
You're dreaming!

611
01:07:05,391 --> 01:07:08,395
That's what I'm here to explain if you'll allow.

612
01:07:08,957 --> 01:07:10,206
Mr. Noda?

613
01:07:11,084 --> 01:07:12,029
The plan...

614
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:16,147
Pardon me.

615
01:07:17,397 --> 01:07:22,389
The plan was drafted by me,
Kenji Noda, ex-Navy technical officer.

616
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,620
The first thing to know...

617
01:07:25,262 --> 01:07:30,089
is that this creature the people
of Odo Island call “Godzilla”...

618
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:33,566
cannot be hurt by conventional firearms.

619
01:07:33,837 --> 01:07:38,799
I saw it take heavy artillery fire
from the guns of Takao...

620
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:41,196
and quickly heal itself.

621
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:44,994
Quiet, please.

622
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:47,998
So we need a totally different approach.

623
01:07:50,227 --> 01:07:52,724
Let me give you a demonstration.

624
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:56,066
This is concentrated salt water.

625
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:01,553
This wood model is weighted down
just enough to barely float.

626
01:08:01,722 --> 01:08:06,616
What happens if we pipe in freon gas,
enveloping it in bubbles?

627
01:08:06,752 --> 01:08:11,072
That's easy. Bubbles or not,
it would stay afloat.

628
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:14,921
That's what you'd think.

629
01:08:21,673 --> 01:08:22,550
It sinks!

630
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:29,707
The freon bubbles prevent the model
from seawater contact.

631
01:08:29,843 --> 01:08:35,513
My idea is to entrap Godzilla like this
and sink it to the ocean floor.

632
01:08:35,818 --> 01:08:39,969
Did you have any idea Doc was
such a bigwig?

633
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:40,982
No.

634
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,427
At over 1500 meters in depth...

635
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:01,052
the Sagami Trench is the deepest
place in nearby waters.

636
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:06,453
The plan is to strap freon cylinders
to Godzilla and let them foam.

637
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,580
We create a bubble membrane.

638
01:09:08,783 --> 01:09:13,542
It'll sink so rapidly that
the pressure will crushe it.

639
01:09:16,784 --> 01:09:19,113
We kill it with the power of the sea.

640
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,602
That's the outline for
Operation Wada Tsumi.

641
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:28,835
It's of the sea.
Won't it withstand the pressure?

642
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:36,177
After 25 seconds, every square
meter applies 1,500 tons of pressure.

643
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:42,085
Even ocean-born creatures cannot
bear such rapid pressure change.

644
01:09:42,154 --> 01:09:43,152
Can you promise...

645
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:46,575
that would kill Godzilla?

646
01:09:48,922 --> 01:09:52,027
Godzilla is an unknown organism.

647
01:09:52,332 --> 01:09:54,458
We can only predict what will happen.

648
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:00,906
But this is our best alternative.

649
01:10:01,176 --> 01:10:03,471
Will it kill it?
Or will it not?

650
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:08,282
I can't absolutely guarantee it.

651
01:10:10,884 --> 01:10:11,894
Shikishima!

652
01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:13,738
It can be done!

653
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:19,996
Mr. Shikishima.

654
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,335
Hear me out, please.

655
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,343
Now let's get to the details.

656
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,201
Two ships will corral Godzilla and wrap it in cable.

657
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:59,006
The cable will have multiple freon gas cylinders attached to it.

658
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:04,463
The gas will be released as it's being tied.

659
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:09,852
And Godzilla will take a rapid plunge of 1,500 meters.

660
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:11,638
What if that fails?

661
01:11:11,672 --> 01:11:13,356
There is a Part B.

662
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,347
Look into the courtyard.

663
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:36,850
Inflate!

664
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,884
I'm Itagaki of Toyo Balloon Company.

665
01:11:45,188 --> 01:11:46,669
What you just saw...

666
01:11:46,805 --> 01:11:52,665
is an inflatable levitation device like the kind,
used in navy aircraft.

667
01:11:52,868 --> 01:11:58,290
CO2 is shot into air sacs for buoyancy.
It's a life preserver.

668
01:11:59,907 --> 01:12:01,793
When Godzilla hits the floor.

669
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:05,431
We raise it quickly back up to the surface.

670
01:12:05,634 --> 01:12:11,966
If it bears the pressure,
it'll then contend massive decompression.

671
01:12:12,337 --> 01:12:16,446
I can't say for sure that it wouldn't survive.

672
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,142
But we must do what we can.

673
01:12:24,329 --> 01:12:26,685
You've all survived a tragic war.

674
01:12:27,192 --> 01:12:32,177
So it pains me to ask you again
to put your lives on the line.

675
01:12:32,312 --> 01:12:34,837
But understand this.

676
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:38,947
We can't rely on the US
or Japanese government.

677
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,517
So the future of this country is in our hands.

678
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:46,528
I can't do it.

679
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,265
I have a family.

680
01:12:50,501 --> 01:12:53,398
And that goes for most people here.

681
01:12:54,139 --> 01:12:58,046
Why are we always the ones
drawing the short straw?

682
01:12:59,023 --> 01:13:01,818
We got enough of that in the war.

683
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:09,212
Please.

684
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:12,176
I beg you to listen very carefully.

685
01:13:12,986 --> 01:13:18,509
This is not an order.
You're all free to leave if you wish.

686
01:13:19,183 --> 01:13:22,551
We have no right to stop you.

687
01:13:46,636 --> 01:13:47,747
This plan...

688
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,216
does it mean certain death?

689
01:13:52,312 --> 01:13:53,557
Of course not.

690
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:59,317
Then it definitely beats wartime.

691
01:14:02,181 --> 01:14:03,460
It can't be helped.

692
01:14:04,876 --> 01:14:06,525
Someone has to do it.

693
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:09,456
Who can sail the ships if not us?

694
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:10,769
That's right.

695
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:15,283
- Well, then! Are we in, boys?
- Yeah!

696
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:24,917
My friends...

697
01:14:27,512 --> 01:14:28,690
thank you.

698
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,643
Hear, hear!

699
01:14:38,342 --> 01:14:43,595
What a surprise, to find you're
the mastermind of such a grand plan.

700
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,862
Well, I've had a direct encounter.

701
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:49,321
So the task fell to me.

702
01:14:49,524 --> 01:14:52,858
And we were called for the same reasons.

703
01:14:53,095 --> 01:14:56,227
Do you think Godzilla will return?

704
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:03,721
I think we can assume that Godzilla
has added Tokyo to "its territory."

705
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:08,505
I expect it'll be back within 10 days at the latest.

706
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:09,784
That soon?

707
01:15:10,021 --> 01:15:12,816
You set up radiation-detection buoys?

708
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:16,117
Visual detection isn't enough.

709
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:20,664
How can you expect it to
walk right into your trap?

710
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:23,359
- I can't.
- What, no plan?

711
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:27,165
Who do you think I am?
Of course, I have a plan.

712
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,555
We have acoustic minesweepers.

713
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:37,406
We use speakers to play
a recording of Godzilla's voice.

714
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:39,258
- Its voice?
- Yeah.

715
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:43,974
It see it as another territorial competitor.

716
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:46,157
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully?

717
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,252
You don't instill confidence.

718
01:15:48,455 --> 01:15:51,586
And that levitation device?

719
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,618
I can't envision that working well.

720
01:15:54,687 --> 01:15:56,470
Any other ideas, then?

721
01:15:56,572 --> 01:16:00,310
I know!
We pull it up with the destroyers.

722
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:05,835
Godzilla weighs some 20,000 tons.
Too heavy for two destroyers.

723
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:07,796
Oh.

724
01:16:08,665 --> 01:16:12,370
In short, your plan is full of holes.

725
01:16:12,977 --> 01:16:16,816
If you have a better one, let's hear it.

726
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,117
Mr. Noda.

727
01:16:22,122 --> 01:16:25,523
Can you get ahold of a fighter plane?

728
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,585
Fighter plane?

729
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:32,364
I could anger it with gunfire
and draw it to Sagami Bay.

730
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:36,023
All planes were decommissioned.

731
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,192
Even if you could, it shoots a heat ray.

732
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:43,309
Your risk your life flying so close.

733
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:45,173
I'll take that risk.

734
01:16:45,343 --> 01:16:48,663
A fighter jet is more nimble than a boat.

735
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:53,001
You're not aiming to get shot down, are you?

736
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:55,526
Do you have a death wish?

737
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:57,762
You're drunk.

738
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,880
You just want to avenge Noriko.

739
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:03,354
Problem with that?

740
01:17:03,558 --> 01:17:05,353
It's too late.

741
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,538
You should've married her before!

742
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:13,113
You knew how she felt.

743
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,028
Don't you think I wanted that, too?

744
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:19,315
Then why didn't you?

745
01:17:21,214 --> 01:17:22,398
Because...

746
01:17:29,076 --> 01:17:31,379
my war isn't over yet.

747
01:17:56,694 --> 01:17:59,133
- You found a plane?
- Yes.

748
01:17:59,236 --> 01:18:01,302
But it's a unique one.

749
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:25,803
It was developed at the end of the war,
Local Fighter Shinden.

750
01:18:27,092 --> 01:18:29,496
Designed to shoot down bombers.

751
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:32,309
And hit speeds over 400 knots [about 740 km/h]

752
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:37,461
It's got a tail wing,
four 30 mm guns, and it's nimble as hell.

753
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:41,256
It's a plane full of innovations.

754
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:45,830
Only a few prototypes vere field deployed.

755
01:18:46,205 --> 01:18:52,913
They were kept here for
a mainland battle that never came.

756
01:18:53,253 --> 01:18:57,590
They were left to rust,
and are in bad shape.

757
01:18:58,455 --> 01:19:00,996
It's not air worthy as is.

758
01:19:01,064 --> 01:19:03,856
What we need is a top mechanic.

759
01:19:03,857 --> 01:19:04,622
Yeah.

760
01:19:05,029 --> 01:19:08,179
Someone who knows their way around a jet fighter.

761
01:19:10,688 --> 01:19:14,381
I know just the person.

762
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,702
Ex-Odo Island detachment mechanic.

763
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:22,142
- Sosaku Tachibana.
- Got it.

764
01:19:22,346 --> 01:19:25,395
Tachibana, Tachibana, Tachibana.

765
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:29,020
No known current address.

766
01:19:29,225 --> 01:19:30,071
Sorry.

767
01:19:30,072 --> 01:19:33,326
We're swamped with search requests.

768
01:19:33,461 --> 01:19:35,696
This will take time.

769
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:38,543
I need to locate him urgently.

770
01:19:38,663 --> 01:19:41,407
So does everybody.

771
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,542
- I beg you, please!
- What?

772
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,252
The country's future depends on it!

773
01:19:46,423 --> 01:19:49,472
I'm sure,
but I can't do the impossible.

774
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:50,539
Sorry.

775
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,234
Well then...

776
01:19:52,777 --> 01:19:55,758
where was he posted before Odo Island?

777
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:57,385
Then where was he?

778
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:07,382
I've asked everywhere.

779
01:20:07,467 --> 01:20:11,703
But this Tachibana probably
doesn't want to be found.

780
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,193
We can find another mechanic.

781
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:17,124
Any other leads?

782
01:20:17,362 --> 01:20:19,124
Just wait a bit longer.

783
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:23,292
Why must it be him?

784
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:25,325
Godzilla can come at anytime.

785
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,629
It has to be Tachibana!

786
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:30,866
He's going to get my message.

787
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,357
Please!

788
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,551
Tachibana.

789
01:21:02,485 --> 01:21:05,940
Mr. Tachibana! It's really you!

790
01:21:09,838 --> 01:21:11,532
What's this about?

791
01:21:15,599 --> 01:21:16,411
Wait.

792
01:21:19,005 --> 01:21:23,680
The Odo Island massacre was all my fault?!

793
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:27,272
Are you serious?

794
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:29,305
I'm sorry.

795
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:35,405
I knew if I angered you,
you'd come find me.

796
01:21:35,694 --> 01:21:36,676
How dare you?

797
01:21:39,252 --> 01:21:41,048
The Ginza attack...

798
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:43,556
was the same as Odo.

799
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,571
It was Godzilla.

800
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:58,195
I need you to repair
a fighter for me.

801
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,483
So I can kill it!

802
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:06,277
I needed to find you,
to ask for your help.

803
01:22:06,498 --> 01:22:09,208
That's why I wrote those letters.

804
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:12,428
Please forgive me!

805
01:22:18,275 --> 01:22:19,595
You're on your own.

806
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,004
I'm not helping you.

807
01:22:23,696 --> 01:22:26,813
No, wait, Mr. Tachibana!

808
01:22:27,018 --> 01:22:31,693
Please listen to me!
I need your help killing Godzilla.

809
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:35,783
It's something only you can do.

810
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:42,198
I burst a mine in its mouth,
and hurt it more than ship guns.

811
01:22:42,402 --> 01:22:45,214
It's vulnerable from the inside.
You get me?

812
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:48,552
You don't mean...

813
01:22:49,976 --> 01:22:55,465
I can kill it if I fly a plane full of
explosives into its mouth.

814
01:23:02,193 --> 01:23:03,479
Kamikaze...

815
01:23:05,751 --> 01:23:07,479
The war isn't over...

816
01:23:10,462 --> 01:23:12,562
for you, either.

817
01:23:15,646 --> 01:23:19,678
- You got that injury falling down?
- Ow.

818
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:23,473
It's swelling up like a grapefruit.

819
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:26,523
It's embarrassing, but I was drunk.

820
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,726
I barely remember it.

821
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:34,385
I guess you deserved to celebrate
after finding Mr. Tachibana.

822
01:23:35,047 --> 01:23:36,944
Tail wing, huh?

823
01:23:38,131 --> 01:23:40,875
I'd heard rumors,
but they actually did it.

824
01:23:43,078 --> 01:23:44,569
Mr. Tachibana.

825
01:23:45,112 --> 01:23:47,362
Thank you all for coming!

826
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,550
You're Mr. Tachibana?

827
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:57,599
So this is the phantom
Local Fighter Shinden, huh?

828
01:23:57,769 --> 01:24:00,649
Can you make this fly?

829
01:24:03,767 --> 01:24:06,375
We'll do all we can.

830
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,104
Thank you.

831
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,425
Good luck. Good luck.

832
01:24:29,691 --> 01:24:30,436
What's wrong?

833
01:24:31,589 --> 01:24:34,808
Brighten up, Mastermind.
It's bad for morale.

834
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:37,044
I know it's my plan.

835
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:41,348
But I'm feeling we'll need
a miracle to make it work.

836
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:45,821
Doing nothing won't cause
a miracle, either.

837
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,346
You're right.

838
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:51,039
Take a look at these guys' faces.

839
01:24:52,549 --> 01:24:54,147
They're not stupid.

840
01:24:54,454 --> 01:24:57,789
They know they're risking their lives.

841
01:24:58,522 --> 01:24:59,473
And yet...

842
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:03,728
their faces are beaming.

843
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,497
They're happy.

844
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:09,173
This time,
they'll make a difference.

845
01:25:10,126 --> 01:25:12,644
Make a difference.

846
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,608
We all came through war.

847
01:25:17,324 --> 01:25:21,033
This time, we're making it right.

848
01:25:33,047 --> 01:25:36,024
<b>"2 Floor Conference Room 3,
Special Disaster Countermeasure HQ"</b>

849
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:36,960
Hurry up!

850
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,690
Make room.

851
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:46,693
One hour ago, east of Hachijo Island...

852
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:50,947
33.10 north, 140.01 east...

853
01:25:51,033 --> 01:25:54,707
We got Geiger readings from multiple buoys.

854
01:25:55,253 --> 01:25:56,035
Followed by...

855
01:25:56,717 --> 01:25:58,995
here and here.

856
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:15,859
Godzilla's coming.

857
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:17,832
At last.

858
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:23,516
At this rate,
it's due to arrive over the Sagami Trench...

859
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:26,204
at 1100 hours tomorrow, which means...

860
01:26:26,325 --> 01:26:30,441
We have to mobilize
and be in positions by 0800.

861
01:26:32,518 --> 01:26:33,573
But tell me...

862
01:26:33,914 --> 01:26:36,465
will your device be ready by then?

863
01:26:37,623 --> 01:26:39,392
Take us with you.

864
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:42,047
The final 3 hours will be critical.

865
01:26:42,183 --> 01:26:44,326
We want it perfect.

866
01:26:44,327 --> 01:26:47,900
But you could get caught in the fight.

867
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,082
We've all seen war, too.

868
01:26:56,630 --> 01:27:03,776
Then everybody, go home tonight.
Spend the time with your families.

869
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:06,805
You mean... be prepared?

870
01:27:11,911 --> 01:27:13,304
Come to think of it...

871
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:19,057
this country has treated life
far too cheaply.

872
01:27:19,925 --> 01:27:22,171
Poorly armored tanks.

873
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:29,113
Poor supply chains resulting in half of
all deaths from starvation and disease.

874
01:27:30,475 --> 01:27:35,681
Fighter planes built without
ejection seats.

875
01:27:37,094 --> 01:27:41,314
And finally, kamikaze
and suicide attacks.

876
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,431
That's why this time...

877
01:27:46,964 --> 01:27:49,923
I'd take pride in a citizen-led effort...

878
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:54,449
that sacrifices no lives at all!

879
01:27:56,663 --> 01:27:58,364
This next battle...

880
01:27:58,943 --> 01:28:00,984
is not one waged to the death.

881
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,102
But a battle to live for the future.

882
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,343
Let's do it!

883
01:28:10,344 --> 01:28:14,428
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

884
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:20,008
Finally, tomorrow's the day.

885
01:28:20,247 --> 01:28:22,993
- I can't wait.
- You're not going.

886
01:28:25,386 --> 01:28:26,440
What do you mean?

887
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:30,014
You're useless with that hand, anyway.

888
01:28:30,593 --> 01:28:32,464
Even Shikishima's going!

889
01:28:32,992 --> 01:28:35,170
Because I'm not a veteran?

890
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:36,939
I can be useful.

891
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:40,274
Not having been to war...

892
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:43,133
is something to be proud of.

893
01:28:49,566 --> 01:28:52,049
I want to defend my country, too.

894
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:57,307
Take me with you!

895
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,650
We've been a team for a long time!

896
01:29:04,233 --> 01:29:05,594
I'm begging you!

897
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:08,351
Take me with you!

898
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:10,733
I want to go with you!

899
01:29:10,904 --> 01:29:13,489
We leave you the future.

900
01:29:13,661 --> 01:29:15,021
Captain!

901
01:29:15,431 --> 01:29:16,893
Mr. Noda!

902
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:30,238
A little lower.

903
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:31,871
Careful.

904
01:29:47,412 --> 01:29:50,407
Here you go, Akiko.

905
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:00,142
I want to...

906
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,427
thank you for everything.

907
01:30:17,095 --> 01:30:18,457
Akiko.

908
01:30:19,428 --> 01:30:21,061
Was it fun with Auntie?

909
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:22,422
It was fun.

910
01:30:22,661 --> 01:30:25,179
Good. I'm glad.

911
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:30,865
Is that for me?

912
01:30:32,602 --> 01:30:33,724
Thank you.

913
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,519
- Akiko.
- Yes.

914
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:46,336
Is this you, me and mom?

915
01:30:47,273 --> 01:30:49,518
That's mom there.

916
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,106
I see.

917
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,734
It's really good.

918
01:31:05,552 --> 01:31:07,526
Why do you look sad?

919
01:31:12,538 --> 01:31:13,790
What's wrong?

920
01:31:14,352 --> 01:31:15,543
Akiko.

921
01:31:16,395 --> 01:31:18,674
There there.

922
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:25,465
It'll be all right.
I'm not leaving you.

923
01:32:41,871 --> 01:32:43,062
Mr. Tachibana.

924
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:46,330
It is ready?

925
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,262
Give me a minute.

926
01:33:03,242 --> 01:33:04,801
The bomb you ordered.

927
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:10,774
Two machine guns,
140 kg... 120 rounds, 80 kg...

928
01:33:10,877 --> 01:33:13,488
And one main fuel tank,
400 kg removed.

929
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:18,680
Instead, a No. 25 bomb in the nose,
and No. 50 in the fuselage.

930
01:33:20,378 --> 01:33:23,194
Now, I can finally pay them back.

931
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:38,718
That's funny.

932
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:45,369
Part of me wants to live.

933
01:33:49,934 --> 01:33:52,343
Same as all the men that day.

934
01:33:53,735 --> 01:33:55,600
They all wanted to go home.

935
01:33:57,128 --> 01:34:02,726
But instead,
they got squashed like bugs.

936
01:34:04,763 --> 01:34:05,984
I understand.

937
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:31,485
This was drawn by a girl named Akiko.

938
01:34:33,421 --> 01:34:35,456
I want to protect her future.

939
01:34:39,868 --> 01:34:43,633
I will stop Godzilla no matter what.

940
01:34:44,466 --> 01:34:46,671
You're finally ready.

941
01:34:48,894 --> 01:34:52,728
Then, this is important.

942
01:34:53,305 --> 01:34:54,187
Look here.

943
01:34:55,851 --> 01:34:57,750
The bomb's safety.

944
01:34:58,464 --> 01:35:00,295
Pull it right before flying in.

945
01:35:00,533 --> 01:35:01,652
Got it?

946
01:35:03,418 --> 01:35:04,639
One more thing.

947
01:35:14,854 --> 01:35:15,939
Akiko.

948
01:35:18,162 --> 01:35:20,876
Are you all by yourself?

949
01:35:21,895 --> 01:35:22,946
Look.

950
01:35:30,277 --> 01:35:31,701
“To Sumiko...”

951
01:35:44,122 --> 01:35:48,702
"Look after Akiko.
Use this money for her."

952
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:58,678
From Daddy?

953
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:02,954
Huh? Yeah, from Daddy.

954
01:36:03,939 --> 01:36:06,382
It's all right.
Don't worry.

955
01:36:23,349 --> 01:36:27,862
This is Kuroshio 12, 35.03 N, 139.41 E.

956
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,830
Many deep sea fish found!

957
01:36:48,562 --> 01:36:57,377
Godzilla sighted in Sagami Bay!
Underwater guidance decoy activated.

958
01:36:57,503 --> 01:37:00,319
Take only essentials you!

959
01:37:01,254 --> 01:37:02,576
Hurry and board!

960
01:37:02,934 --> 01:37:04,493
Let's get a move on.

961
01:37:06,021 --> 01:37:08,158
Mizushima took our advice?

962
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,753
It's the best thing for him.

963
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:12,485
I didn't want Shikishima to fly, either.

964
01:37:12,723 --> 01:37:16,048
A failed kamikaze pilot?
It worries me.

965
01:37:16,201 --> 01:37:19,390
He's got Akiko.
He'll make it back alive.

966
01:37:29,588 --> 01:37:32,099
Underwater decoy team destroyed!

967
01:37:32,337 --> 01:37:37,901
Godzilla has entered Sagami Bay!
Wada Tsumi ships, leave port now!

968
01:37:38,326 --> 01:37:39,174
Look.

969
01:37:40,227 --> 01:37:41,277
There!

970
01:37:41,754 --> 01:37:43,450
It's already here?

971
01:37:54,563 --> 01:37:58,465
Godzilla's through final defense line!
Heading for shore!

972
01:37:59,518 --> 01:38:00,501
I'm off!

973
01:38:55,153 --> 01:38:59,733
Time to end it once and for all, Shikishima.

974
01:39:00,395 --> 01:39:07,283
Leave port now! Repeat.
Wada Tsumi ships leave port now!

975
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:16,021
What now?
The plan's ruined!

976
01:39:16,734 --> 01:39:18,566
We embark anyway.

977
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:23,656
We need to sink it over Sagami Trench
or it won't work.

978
01:39:23,861 --> 01:39:27,185
Shikishima will have to lure it!

979
01:39:27,355 --> 01:39:28,407
Move out!

980
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:29,289
Let's go!

981
01:39:45,697 --> 01:39:48,106
Radio from Mr. Shikishima!

982
01:39:49,701 --> 01:39:54,349
I'm in the air preparing to lure
Godzilla to target area.

983
01:39:54,486 --> 01:39:56,352
We'll be ready.

984
01:39:56,454 --> 01:39:57,709
Get there quickly.

985
01:39:57,913 --> 01:40:03,124
Don't do anything rash!
I won't forgive you if you orphan Akiko.

986
01:40:06,193 --> 01:40:08,262
You hear me, Shikishima!

987
01:40:09,858 --> 01:40:12,572
He's ignoring me.

988
01:40:35,241 --> 01:40:36,732
Mail!

989
01:40:38,091 --> 01:40:39,006
Coming.

990
01:40:45,743 --> 01:40:46,624
Hello.

991
01:40:46,795 --> 01:40:48,253
Ms. Shikishima?

992
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:52,325
You have a telegram.
- Thanks.

993
01:42:16,872 --> 01:42:20,027
Wow. Was to lure it out!

994
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:23,964
Godzilla looks really ticked off.

995
01:42:24,202 --> 01:42:25,389
It's in pursuot.

996
01:42:25,831 --> 01:42:27,527
Our turn now.

997
01:42:30,649 --> 01:42:32,218
All ships, battle positions!

998
01:42:32,218 --> 01:42:34,790
All ships, battle positions!

999
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:38,555
Freon cylinders ready!

1000
01:42:38,828 --> 01:42:41,476
46 cm cannonballs ready!
Levitation switch ready!

1001
01:42:41,692 --> 01:42:43,174
Cables ready!

1002
01:42:43,512 --> 01:42:45,499
All circuits ready!

1003
01:42:45,635 --> 01:42:46,483
Power on,

1004
01:42:46,531 --> 01:42:48,364
release safety device!

1005
01:43:04,724 --> 01:43:07,419
That's it. Keep coming.

1006
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:12,575
- Team one attacks as planned.
- As planned!

1007
01:43:44,167 --> 01:43:46,087
Atta boy.

1008
01:44:22,514 --> 01:44:25,614
That's Godzilla's heat ray.

1009
01:44:27,957 --> 01:44:32,707
The ships won't survive this.
All ships must evacuate!

1010
01:44:32,977 --> 01:44:34,426
No, this is okay.

1011
01:44:34,629 --> 01:44:36,077
Stick to the plan.

1012
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:38,065
But the heat ray!

1013
01:44:38,268 --> 01:44:42,412
Once fired, it takes time to regenerate.

1014
01:44:42,952 --> 01:44:43,962
We go now!

1015
01:44:45,378 --> 01:44:46,691
Give the order!

1016
01:44:52,033 --> 01:44:54,189
Commence Operation Wada Tsumi!

1017
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,817
Fire 46 cm cannonballs,
cylinders and levitation switch!

1018
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:43,472
Shikishima!

1019
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:10,817
Crane deployed!

1020
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:11,895
Roger!

1021
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:15,130
Maintain course, Hibiki!

1022
01:46:15,249 --> 01:46:17,439
Hibiki, maintain course!

1023
01:46:17,675 --> 01:46:20,909
Maintain speed, some damage inevitable.

1024
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:27,885
Hibiki closing in, 4 meters!

1025
01:46:28,829 --> 01:46:30,142
2 meters!

1026
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,376
Brace for impact!

1027
01:46:32,377 --> 01:46:33,648
Brace for impact!

1028
01:46:48,491 --> 01:46:50,745
Crossing complete!
Full speed!

1029
01:46:50,747 --> 01:46:51,663
Full speed!

1030
01:46:51,794 --> 01:46:52,906
Full speed!

1031
01:47:07,851 --> 01:47:10,310
Very good!

1032
01:47:11,086 --> 01:47:13,141
- Captain, the switch.
- Roger!

1033
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:23,789
Oh no. Not yet?

1034
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:26,266
Almost.

1035
01:47:36,982 --> 01:47:39,205
Ready...

1036
01:47:48,389 --> 01:47:50,343
- Hit it, Captain!
- Now!

1037
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:54,218
- Freon!
- Got it!

1038
01:48:10,899 --> 01:48:15,447
Depth 1,200 meters!
1,300 meters!

1039
01:48:16,088 --> 01:48:18,008
- 1,400 meters!
- Keep going!

1040
01:48:18,177 --> 01:48:19,928
- Dive!
- 1,450 meters!

1041
01:48:21,177 --> 01:48:25,051
1,500 target passed!

1042
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:40,046
We sunk Godzilla!

1043
01:48:40,132 --> 01:48:41,445
Did it succeed?

1044
01:48:49,129 --> 01:48:50,846
Persistent bugger.

1045
01:48:51,386 --> 01:48:53,946
- Move to Part B.
- Do it.

1046
01:49:12,514 --> 01:49:14,131
Now rise

1047
01:49:14,688 --> 01:49:19,304
Depth 1,200 meters!
1,100 meters 1,000 meters!

1048
01:49:27,914 --> 01:49:29,160
Cables stopped!

1049
01:49:29,768 --> 01:49:32,024
They stopped at 803 meters!

1050
01:49:33,262 --> 01:49:35,360
Why? Why did they stop?

1051
01:49:39,792 --> 01:49:41,241
It chewed through?

1052
01:49:44,409 --> 01:49:46,801
Hibiki, pull Godzilla up!

1053
01:49:46,869 --> 01:49:48,755
90 degrees max speed!

1054
01:49:48,824 --> 01:49:51,350
The two ships lack the thrust.

1055
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:54,955
We've no choice.
Give it all you can!

1056
01:49:55,461 --> 01:49:56,489
Yes, sir!

1057
01:50:13,372 --> 01:50:14,753
At this rate...

1058
01:50:15,259 --> 01:50:16,606
the crane won't hold.

1059
01:50:16,809 --> 01:50:18,089
Get away quickly!

1060
01:50:40,633 --> 01:50:44,912
This is Yokohama tugboats Fujimaru!

1061
01:50:45,165 --> 01:50:47,490
Doing our best to help!

1062
01:50:47,794 --> 01:50:49,309
That voice.

1063
01:50:49,702 --> 01:50:52,511
Mizushima here.
Is that you, Captain?

1064
01:50:53,627 --> 01:50:55,847
Kid, is that you?

1065
01:50:56,572 --> 01:50:57,515
You bet!

1066
01:50:57,886 --> 01:51:01,255
This is Toyo Kisen's Koeimaru,
here to help.

1067
01:51:01,458 --> 01:51:05,029
And Yokohama Eisen's Nikkomaru!
At your service!

1068
01:51:05,165 --> 01:51:06,647
Shiokazemaru, assisting!

1069
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:07,826
Tetsuyumaru.

1070
01:51:08,029 --> 01:51:09,578
- Nanamimaru.
- Minamimaru.

1071
01:51:09,815 --> 01:51:11,263
- Kisshomaru.
- Junseimaru.

1072
01:51:11,467 --> 01:51:12,813
- Wakamaru.
- Heimitsumaru.

1073
01:51:12,949 --> 01:51:14,026
Tenyumaru.

1074
01:51:14,263 --> 01:51:15,644
- Kaiomaru.
- Hyuga.

1075
01:51:15,847 --> 01:51:17,127
- Choukamaru.
- Shuseimaru.

1076
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:18,575
- Taramaru.
- Yasakamaru.

1077
01:51:18,947 --> 01:51:21,945
The useless to the rescue!

1078
01:51:25,249 --> 01:51:26,731
I'll be damned.

1079
01:51:26,967 --> 01:51:29,797
I gotta admit I'm glad to see him.

1080
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,605
All you tugboats out there!
Let's catch a Godzilla!

1081
01:51:33,757 --> 01:51:37,665
- Everybody pull!
- Everybody pull!

1082
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:05,179
Godzilla's rising again!

1083
01:52:06,578 --> 01:52:09,846
Come on, show your face!

1084
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:12,609
Depth 700 meters!

1085
01:52:13,386 --> 01:52:15,473
Keep coming, keep coming!

1086
01:52:46,241 --> 01:52:47,789
It's not damaged enough!

1087
01:52:48,733 --> 01:52:50,957
All ships evasive action!

1088
01:53:41,723 --> 01:53:43,137
What's he doing?

1089
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,349
No.

1090
01:53:48,526 --> 01:53:50,546
- Don't.
- Stop!

1091
01:53:50,749 --> 01:53:52,230
Shikishima!

1092
01:54:19,494 --> 01:54:20,874
Shikishima…

1093
01:54:35,795 --> 01:54:37,477
No, look!

1094
01:54:42,025 --> 01:54:43,405
I see him.

1095
01:54:44,921 --> 01:54:46,336
I see him!

1096
01:54:48,710 --> 01:54:52,212
Pilot ejected!
He's alive!

1097
01:55:00,734 --> 01:55:03,696
This seat has an ejection button.

1098
01:55:04,775 --> 01:55:06,492
Just pull that lever.

1099
01:55:10,635 --> 01:55:11,611
Live.

1100
01:55:14,037 --> 01:55:15,350
Mr. Tachibana.

1101
01:56:45,812 --> 01:56:47,394
Shikishima!

1102
01:56:52,194 --> 01:56:53,608
You did it!

1103
01:56:54,619 --> 01:56:55,662
You did it!

1104
01:56:57,818 --> 01:56:58,996
Kid!

1105
01:57:03,021 --> 01:57:03,930
Sumiko!

1106
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:04,941
Koichi!

1107
01:57:06,087 --> 01:57:08,612
- Koichi!
- Akiko!

1108
01:57:15,079 --> 01:57:15,991
What?

1109
01:57:57,811 --> 01:57:59,704
Is your war...

1110
01:58:01,868 --> 01:58:03,388
finally over?
