1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,474
Are you crying?

3
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,319
Do you want me to stay or leave?

4
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,907
I want you to leave.

5
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,827
I want you…

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,748
to come with me.

7
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,765
The demolition is done.

8
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,184
What's there to talk about?

9
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,938
I have a gift.

10
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,691
You were against
the demolition. Now a gift?

11
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,194
I won't accept it.
Anti-Graft Law, you know.

12
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,737
The law's not applicable.

13
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,324
I'm giving back what was yours to you.

14
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,797
Who said this black mini-coffin was mine?

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,048
Shaman Eun-wol did.

16
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,217
Oh, that cute lady.

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,677
She seemed really nice.

18
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,761
I don't want this.

19
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,680
She gave her consent for demolition.

20
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,224
Are you refusing a gift
from your lifesaver?

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,478
What's inside?

22
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,190
You should open it. It's yours.

23
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,817
I don't want to.

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,278
It looks like there would be bones inside.

25
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
There might be relics instead of bones.

26
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,073
Maybe a painting of Shin Yun-bok.

27
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,088
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

28
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,673
It's okay.

29
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,176
I don't like getting rides
from people I'm not close with.

30
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,929
Using public transport must be hard.

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,099
It's not easy to get close to
bus, taxi, and subway drivers.

32
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,602
I wanted to give

33
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,688
this wooden box a ride, not you.

34
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,025
Because it seems like
a 300-year-old antique.

35
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,694
Call me when you open it.

36
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,613
I want to know what's inside too.

37
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,573
-You can do that, right?
-Well, sure.

38
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,201
I hope you meet a bus driver
you're close to and get a ride home.

39
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,203
I'll take a cab!

40
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,666
He's so full of himself.

41
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,178
Don't worry about your father.

42
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,349
He went to the vast ocean.

43
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,684
His dream was to travel the world.

44
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,312
He fulfilled his wish.

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,607
My baby.

46
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,569
You must've been so lonely.

47
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
How frustrating.

48
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,287
You're surrounded by dumb people.

49
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,042
They don't realize how sweet you are.

50
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,172
She was a nice lady.

51
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,466
She wouldn't have given me
something strange.

52
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,113
Should I bring this
to Authentic Masterpieces?

53
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,242
Could it really be
Shin Yun-bok's painting?

54
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,162
Don't jump the gun.

55
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,664
Let's open it first.

56
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,756
What's this?

57
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,447
Jeez!

58
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,877
If you're going to play hard to get,

59
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,796
get lost.

60
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,553
WOODEN BOX

61
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,990
JANG SIN-YU

62
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,368
Isn't it too late at night for a call?

63
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,537
You made me call at this late hour.

64
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,996
Did you open the box?

65
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,124
No.

66
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:57,792
Why didn't you?

67
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,336
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

68
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,674
I wanted to break it with an ax,
but I couldn't. Why?

69
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,134
I don't have an ax at home.

70
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,301
Are you drunk?

71
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,264
I don't get drunk on two cans of beer.

72
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,270
People won't open up to me.

73
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,272
Even the lock won't open up to me.

74
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,983
Why are they doing this to me?

75
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,401
Son.

76
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,820
Come and hang out with me.

77
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,780
I'm on the phone.

78
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,115
I'll join you after this.

79
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,914
Stop drinking
and open the wooden box first.

80
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,749
When you do, call me.

81
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,381
Someone must be happy

82
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,009
to have a friendly mom.

83
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,431
"Hang out with me."

84
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,435
ONJU CITY

85
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
Good morning.

86
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,396
It's not good.

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,732
My skull feels like it's crushed.

88
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,611
I thought my face was the only thing
that aged, but now my body has too.

89
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,781
Hong-jo. Can you go to a convenience store

90
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,409
and get some hangover drinks?

91
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,827
Sure.

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,455
No, don't sweat it.

93
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,790
It's okay. I'll make it quick.

94
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,002
What if she reports me to the Audit Team

95
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
for making her run personal errands?

96
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,632
Mr. Gong…

97
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,218
You finished the report already.

98
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,846
I have a headache, so I'll read it later.

99
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,683
-Okay.
-Why? Can't I read it later?

100
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,977
You gave me such a rebellious look.

101
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,437
With those big eyes.

102
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,190
I'm not.

103
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,027
I'll be out for the hanging basket issue.

104
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,530
I'll eat lunch outside too,

105
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,031
so don't worry about me.

106
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,078
Let's go have hangover soup
at 11:00 for brunch.

107
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,290
We always do this around this time.

108
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,502
So we must hang them
by next week at the latest.

109
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,672
On top of that,
Mayor uses that road to get to work.

110
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,925
I could've been in serious trouble.

111
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,556
This is zonal geranium.

112
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,641
Calendula, Moulin Rouge,

113
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,561
Maverick Orange, and Horizon Appleblossom.

114
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,688
We have various types.

115
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,940
So choose what you like.

116
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,235
I met Lawyer Seo in the afternoon.

117
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,988
We lost the lawsuit against Haum.

118
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,449
-Again?
-The lawyers hired to represent Onju City

119
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,535
lose over 60% of the time.

120
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,580
So we've wasted more than
1.2 billion won of the city's budget.

121
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:46,294
Civil servants waste their time
and money consulting lawyers externally.

122
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,838
This is why I suggest

123
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:53,342
we hire a new legal advisor,
the role's been vacant for a year.

124
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,972
Just keep two law firms
and hire a competent lawyer in City Hall.

125
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,515
That is more cost-effective.

126
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,602
It is a good idea.

127
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,022
But would a cost-effective
and competent lawyer come here?

128
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,982
The salary is rather…

129
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,611
There might be someone
uninterested in money.

130
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,323
There is no such person.

131
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,868
LAW &amp; HIGH

132
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,953
"All the pain and curses will end."

133
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,748
"The owner of the wooden box showed up."

134
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,833
The box belongs to

135
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,252
Lee Hong-jo.

136
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,171
But,

137
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,757
she's not calling me.

138
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,021
What is it?

139
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:47,938
Did you open it?

140
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,565
No. Not yet.

141
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,775
Why didn't you?

142
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,151
I was busy.

143
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,527
Hey, lady.

144
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,323
You can't sit on that swing.

145
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,786
Were you eating alone on a swing?

146
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,956
You must not know
what a civil servant does.

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,709
-It's all--
-I don't need to know. Do I?

148
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,835
When are you done?

149
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,129
I'm not sure.

150
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,965
-I might work overtime--
-Don't work overtime today.

151
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,177
Get off work early
and open it as soon as you go home.

152
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,261
Call me when you do.

153
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,972
I didn't hear an answer.

154
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,641
I don't want to call you.

155
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,477
Even Aladdin was polite to Genie.

156
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,355
But you're not polite to me at all.

157
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,399
Then, I'll ask you politely.

158
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,068
Please open the wooden box today.

159
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,362
Please give me a call too.

160
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,658
Okay. Then I shall think about it and--

161
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,620
Hello?

162
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,248
Did he hang up?

163
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,541
Hey!

164
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,131
I told you not to sit there.

165
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,387
Darn it.

166
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,434
You were three years ahead of me?

167
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,477
You won't know.

168
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,523
I was always in the library.
You were always out having fun.

169
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,191
I studied hard.

170
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,027
Every day and night.

171
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,155
You played basketball
in front of the library.

172
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,489
It was very noisy.

173
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,284
Are you here to claim damages for it?

174
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,661
I'm here to recruit you
as a City Hall lawyer.

175
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,457
Do you know how much I earn?

176
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm not interested.

177
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,960
We can't pay you that much anyway. But…

178
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,756
I didn't know you were greedy for money.

179
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,802
I'm not greedy for money.

180
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,513
But I don't want a job
that doesn't motivate me.

181
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,599
You want me to counsel civil servants

182
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,225
and assist with lawsuits.

183
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,477
You'll deal with big firms.

184
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,479
Numerous big companies

185
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,065
that do illegal things
without paying tens of billions in taxes.

186
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,197
Tell me as soon as possible

187
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,823
so I can decide the next candidate.

188
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,868
Can I ask?

189
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,998
Among those numerous big companies.

190
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,833
Is Haum one of them?

191
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,710
Of course.

192
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,516
One, two, three, four,

193
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,937
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven.

194
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,650
I knew it. Is this fate?

195
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,111
Both Mr. Kwon and I are working overtime.

196
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,315
CIVIL SERVANT HONG-JO

197
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,236
What is it?

198
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,739
You told me not to
work overtime, but you are.

199
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,033
It's not your face that I want to see.

200
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,493
Exactly.

201
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,537
Have a video call with the wooden box.

202
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
Look for yourself.

203
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,916
The lock is strange.

204
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
It has no hole.

205
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,713
I didn't ask you to open a floodgate.

206
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,840
You can't unlock that small lock?

207
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,010
That's why I'm going to try
and unlock it again now.

208
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,679
As you said, I'll use my brain over brawn.

209
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,473
Now watch closely, in real time.

210
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,985
Open.

211
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:08,157
Open.

212
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,164
See? No matter how hard
I rub it, it won't open.

213
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,582
Genie won't come out.

214
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,125
Then, another method.

215
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,960
Instead of "open sesame,"

216
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,588
open, wooden box!

217
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,095
Look. It didn't open.

218
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,597
This is not the end.

219
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,395
Abracadabra.

220
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,773
Hocus-pocus.

221
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,821
The box could be from China.

222
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,156
From the Qing dynasty.

223
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,955
I'll go crazy like this

224
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,790
I used to be soft and kind

225
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,458
But I go crazy because of you

226
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,168
I become mean

227
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,421
I cast a spell on the wooden box
That looks like you

228
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,549
Wooden box, open

229
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,017
I even cast a magic spell.

230
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,477
But look.

231
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,395
It didn't open.

232
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,271
-Then--
-Wait.

233
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,775
Even dogs wait when they're told to.

234
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,069
They don't bark nor ask for food.

235
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,654
I'm not a dog.

236
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
You said you're cute like a puppy.

237
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,074
That means you're a dog.

238
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,909
Wait.

239
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
I'll call you.

240
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,745
Don't ever call me first.

241
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,955
Do you understand?

242
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,634
There's no use waiting.

243
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,262
I did my best.

244
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,431
You call this a gift?

245
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,752
Still, I won't throw you away.

246
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,006
I know how painful it is to be abandoned.

247
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,929
LAW &amp; HIGH

248
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,479
Hi. Have a seat.

249
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,287
I heard Mr. Jang added a condition

250
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,373
in return for covering up the incident

251
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,293
that happened last time.

252
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,512
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,475
I did not behave appropriately

254
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,187
as an owner of a company.

255
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:29,066
For being rude to you all,

256
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,197
I sincerely… apologize!

257
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,336
Is this enough of a sincere apology?

258
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,679
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,972
I'm sorry, okay?

260
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,640
Sorry.

261
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,684
My sincerest apologies. I'm sorry.

262
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,104
Gosh.

263
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,982
I have a terrible habit when drunk.

264
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,234
I should quit drinking. Right?

265
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,031
It's not easy to do so
since I run a company.

266
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,285
Be generous and let it slide.

267
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,995
Okay?

268
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,622
You can all get back to work.

269
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,041
I also had to make time
from my busy schedule.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,293
Have a safe trip back.

271
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,588
LAW &amp; HIGH
YOUR LEGAL PARTNER

272
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,936
Hey.

273
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,399
Do you know how much
I spent on your watches?

274
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,902
Two, four, six, eight.

275
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,237
The CEO's and even yours. Fuck!

276
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
I spent 500 million won, damn it!

277
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,784
But why…

278
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,705
Why won't you bow to me?

279
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,047
Because I don't work for Law &amp; High.

280
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,634
RESIGNATION LETTER

281
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,552
I just resigned.

282
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,682
Jang Sin-yu, what are you doing?

283
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,894
One lawyer and the biggest client.

284
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,647
Which one will you choose?

285
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
It's hot.

286
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,432
It tastes bad.

287
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,060
MAMAMOO - HIP

288
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,118
What am I doing?

289
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,882
Two, three…

290
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,560
The ballast was the issue.

291
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,775
Are you okay?

292
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,125
You should've let me do it.

293
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,001
Why would you do this?

294
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,047
Because you are

295
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,466
not here.

296
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,855
Please,

297
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,440
can you come?

298
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,222
Are you coming from the hospital?

299
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,560
I went shopping
as per Dr. Kim's recommendation.

300
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,812
PATIENT: JANG SIN-YU

301
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,189
I heard you quit work.

302
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,983
You should rest now.

303
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,985
Don't go and work elsewhere.

304
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,363
In high school,

305
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,576
I thought you were going to pass away.

306
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,040
But you're alive and well now.

307
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,251
Yours is incurable.

308
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,337
Mine wasn't.

309
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:06,880
Take a rest…

310
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,008
and get married.

311
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,094
Honey.

312
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,849
Did you pressure him to get married? Why?

313
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,185
I don't want to marry him off.

314
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,854
Don't get married young.

315
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,106
Look at me.

316
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,484
I ruined my life as soon as I got married.

317
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,361
Just keep quiet.

318
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,987
You don't know anything.

319
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,781
What do I not know?

320
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,700
I also know

321
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,744
that Sin-yu quit his job.

322
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,039
You always loaf around at home.

323
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,832
How did you know that?

324
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,459
Did you see it?

325
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,295
How do you know
if I loafed around or ran around?

326
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,761
KWON JAE-GYEONG, POLICY ADVISOR

327
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,666
What is this?

328
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:36,803
SPELLS OF THE HEAVENS

329
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,849
What?

330
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,152
"Spells of the Heavens."

331
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,322
What's this?

332
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,740
Is this a comic book knock-off?

333
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,204
"Introduction."

334
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,501
"I, Aeng-cho, a shaman of Joseon,

335
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:15,133
write this spell book

336
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:19,387
after acquiring the secret skill

337
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,056
towards the end of my life."

338
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,143
Is this a spell book?

339
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:31,983
"Only I and the person I choose

340
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,653
can cast the spells."

341
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,700
"Commandments."

342
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:46,539
"Pick clean and faultless ingredients."

343
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:47,999
Pass.

344
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,253
"A spell for getting pregnant."

345
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,171
Pass.

346
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,924
"Pass the Exam Spell."

347
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,176
"Good Fortune Spell."

348
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,346
"Fair Skin Spell."

349
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,516
"Anti-aging Spell."

350
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,518
"Love Spell."

351
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,145
How absurd.

352
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:13,274
So… if I do as Aeng-cho wrote,

353
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,693
I can give birth to a son, become pretty,

354
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,405
get a lover, and so on and so forth.

355
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,073
It's nonsense.

356
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,784
Genie of the lamp is more credible.

357
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,911
Why did I open it?

358
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,207
It's a bias.

359
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,710
Why do I believe
in Western spells but not Korean?

360
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,800
LOVE SPELL

361
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,582
I like this.

362
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,709
"Love Spell."

363
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,555
Why are you here?

364
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,307
Did you open it?

365
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,683
I told you to wait.

366
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,352
Keeping a dog waiting for a week is abuse.

367
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,855
Even border collies
can't wait more than a day.

368
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,690
Did you come here to ask that?

369
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,733
I'm going to work.

370
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,193
Your office is in Gangnam.

371
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,486
But you're here for work?

372
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,238
-Answer first. Did you open the box?
-No.

373
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,158
Then give it back.

374
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,744
I don't think
you're the owner of the wooden box.

375
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,914
You're wrong.
I think I'm the owner of the wooden box.

376
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,250
-Did you open it?
-I didn't. It opened on its own.

377
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,585
Why didn't you call me?

378
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,962
I said it opened on its own.
I didn't open it.

379
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,340
As a lawyer,
you should know the difference.

380
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,633
What was inside?

381
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,552
-A book.
-A book?

382
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,387
It was ridiculous.

383
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,265
It was written
by some shaman named Aeng-cho.

384
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,476
Saying if you do this and that with stuff,

385
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,144
you'll be pretty and get a son.

386
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,522
It's a spell book that grants your wishes.

387
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,234
Elaborate on it.

388
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,735
I can't. It makes no sense.

389
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,986
It's absolute nonsense.

390
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,155
It was so hard to read it too.

391
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,826
It was like the Old Korean
from the Joseon Dynasty.

392
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,744
Do you know each other?

393
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,373
Well…

394
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,918
I know him
due to the demolition of the shrine.

395
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,295
He's the owner of the land.

396
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,005
I see.

397
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,258
Wait, what happened?

398
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,345
Your forehead is bruised badly.

399
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,393
Is it obvious?

400
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,436
I put on a lot of concealer.

401
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,148
Why are you
tucking your hair behind your ears?

402
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,819
Let's go up.

403
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,779
Isn't Mayor waiting for me?

404
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,033
I told you I was on my way to work.

405
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,537
Today is my first day
as the City Hall's lawyer.

406
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,631
Did he get fired?

407
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,842
Good morning.

408
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,051
Good morning.

409
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,971
Hong-jo.

410
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,598
-Yes.
-By any chance,

411
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,808
do you know Mr. Kwon Jae-gyeong?

412
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,354
Well…

413
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,649
Who in this City Hall
doesn't know Mr. Kwon?

414
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,943
He's well-known as PV.

415
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,945
So you don't know him personally.

416
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,449
Then why did he post this?

417
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,243
What post?

418
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:55,121
Someone complimented you
on the City Hall message board.

419
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,831
But the thing is,

420
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,000
the poster is Kwon Jae-gyeong.

421
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:03,421
Mr. Kwon has no time to compliment
a mere ninth-grade civil servant.

422
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,714
It must be someone else.

423
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,841
LET'S COMPLIMENT

424
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:07,926
Kwon Jae-gyeong.

425
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,260
Such a common name.

426
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,554
Why is the chart broken?

427
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,472
KWON JAE-GYEONG

428
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,807
PRAISE BOARD

429
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,561
I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR LEE HONG-JO.

430
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,901
What happened?

431
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,654
Your forehead is bruised badly.

432
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,039
You must like PV too.

433
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,874
No, I--

434
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,883
You better get in line.

435
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,010
If you line up behind me,

436
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,681
you'll be like… 102nd in line.

437
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,641
Okay.

438
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,978
Your face is very red now.

439
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,938
I see.

440
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,698
It's nice.

441
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,199
It's simple

442
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,410
and neat.

443
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,538
This is Park Gi-dong from the Legal Team.

444
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,873
He's been dealing with law-related tasks.

445
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,709
Mr. Park, make an announcement

446
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,503
and tell people to consult
Mr. Jang regarding lawsuits.

447
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,463
I have a meeting, so I'm off.

448
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,048
Thank you.

449
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,977
Your nameplate.

450
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,272
Nice to meet you.

451
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,278
You'll have a hard time for about a month.

452
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,321
The work isn't easy.

453
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,033
The work is very different
from that of law firms.

454
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,535
I see.

455
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,956
Then can you find all the documents
that the previous advisor dealt with

456
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,291
by today so I can learn?

457
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,419
Take your time.

458
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,591
There won't be anyone
who comes for a consultation for a while.

459
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,093
They wouldn't trust
a novice legal advisor.

460
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,222
That's good.
I had an urgent personal business.

461
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,489
It was written
by some shaman named Aeng-cho.

462
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,699
Saying if you do this and that with stuff,

463
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,618
you'll be pretty and get a son.

464
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,787
It's a spell book that grants your wishes.

465
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,630
JOSEON DYNASTY RECORDS

466
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,424
ARCHIVES OF JOSEON HISTORY

467
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,759

468
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,514
AENG-CHO

469
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,934
KOREAN HISTORY

THE VERITABLE RECORDS OF KING HYOJONG 7

471
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,110
WILY SHAMAN, AENG-CHO

472
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,487
AENG-CHO IS A FEMALE SHAMAN.
SHE IS SECRETIVE.

473
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,282
Aeng-cho was a real person.

474
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,160
The person who killed Aeng-cho

475
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,246
was Jang Mu-jin.

476
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,093
I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR LEE HONG-JO.

477
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,266
Did you stay here to have fun?

478
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,560
Is this how you get overtime pay?

479
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,978
You startled me.

480
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,020
That's not it.

481
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,734
GREEN BREATH ONJU

482
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,819
I'll drive you home.

483
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,404
I told you last time.

484
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,781
We're not close enough for that.

485
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,576
What's your definition of being close?

486
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,036
If we eat together? Or if we hold hands?

487
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,621
Tell me how you define it.

488
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,999
I'll do whatever, so let's get close.

489
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,917
Why must we get close?

490
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,173
I want to see…

491
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,261
the spell book in the wooden box.

492
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,931
That was your goal.

493
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,601
But I can't let a man
into my house at night.

494
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,436
I didn't say I would go inside.

495
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
I'll return it tomorrow.

496
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,276
I can drop by on my way home
and read it. Right?

497
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
Sure, then.

498
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,239
I'll think of it as a cab.

499
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,200
It's not that way.

500
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,252
I'm saying this just in case.

501
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,004
Don't change your mind later.

502
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,048
You said it was mine.

503
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,301
You said it didn't make sense.

504
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,427
You want to keep it?

505
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,888
You clearly said this
when you gave it to me.

506
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,098
"I'm giving back what was yours…"

507
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,058
Turn right.

508
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,230
Stop in front there.

509
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,733
Is your house the bus stop?

510
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,069
It's a quick walk up the alley.

511
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,362
It takes longer by car.

512
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,863
You need to pay.

513
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,490
You said this was a cab ride.

514
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,451
How much is it?

515
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,161
Keep it. It's my donation.

516
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,127
Gosh.

517
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,089
So bothersome.

518
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,237
Cheong-ah.

519
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,905
Hey, Cheong-ah.

520
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,034
Cheong-ah, where have you been?

521
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,828
Cheong-ah.

522
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,371
Cheong-ah, where are you going?

523
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,039
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

524
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,542
What's wrong with you? Don't do this.

525
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,337
-That's not me.
-Cheong-ah.

526
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,006
Cheong-ah.

527
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,134
What are you doing?

528
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,844
-Cheong-ah.
-You got the wrong--

529
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,807
Who are you?

530
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,559
I told you to wait.

531
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,353
You should wait when you're told to.

532
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,896
Why would you go up alone?

533
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,911
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,509
Why did you follow me?

535
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,636
I was bored.

536
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,935
Can I let go of your hand now?

537
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,691
By the way,

538
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,110
don't you know how to file a complaint?

539
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,197
If the street lamps are bad,
ask for replacements.

540
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,533
They said I should wait
until they change them to LEDs.

541
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,578
Then ask your family to pick you up.

542
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,413
I don't have a family.

543
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:43,672
Ever since I was transferred to City Hall,
I've been eating alone.

544
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,467
I eat alone at home,

545
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,678
so I don't want
to eat alone at work as well.

546
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,473
They'll know I'm an outcast.

547
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,619
Do you live here alone?

548
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,289
The owners used to live
on the first floor.

549
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,458
But they went to the countryside to farm.

550
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,879
Thank you for earlier.

551
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,342
I'll bring it down soon.

552
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,773
Do you want to come up for a while?

553
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,370
This wasn't what you said.

554
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:01,417
You told me to replace the ballast,
because you'd show me the spell book.

555
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,334
No.

556
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,921
I said I would show you the book
if you replace the ballast.

557
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,715
What if I get electrocuted?

558
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,175
You have gloves on.

559
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,968
It might explode.

560
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,804
Who is your match?

561
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,390
If you can't do it, come down.

562
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,809
That's not it. I just need more time.

563
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,021
I'm doing something
I've never done before.

564
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,439
I never did it before,

565
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,941
but once I set my mind to it,
there's nothing I--

566
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,780
Look at you.

567
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,533
Stop acting like
you're in pain. Come down.

568
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,203
I'm not acting. I'm actually in pain.

569
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,331
You haven't done it
and you're in pain, so you can't do it.

570
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,957
So come down.

571
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,212
Give me a glass of water.

572
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,216
Gosh.

573
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,399
I have a good idea.

574
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,901
Call a repairman.

575
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,653
Nobody uses lights like that.

576
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,321
The street lamps will be LED--

577
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,036
Read it.

578
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,336
Gosh, as if it's something special.

579
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,589
Read it and laugh with me.

580
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,591
You know,

581
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,803
everything's funnier
when you do it together.

582
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,762
PREFACE

583
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,267
Even the title is funny.

584
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,644
I thought it was
a knock-off of a comic book.

585
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,524
Isn't it funny?

586
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,109
The book is funny overall,

587
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,319
but "Good Fortune Spell."

588
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,988
This spell is the funniest.

589
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,199
It's telling you to raise
a shaggy dog for ten years.

590
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,212
Isn't it funny?

591
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,757
Am I the only one?

592
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,012
"Cure Disease Spell."

593
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,683
"The spell that cures your disease."

594
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,240
I showed you the spell book, so leave now.

595
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,252
Lee Hong-jo.

596
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,858
I want something.

597
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,078
Take all the other spells in the book.

598
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,000
But can you give me

599
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,878
just one spell?

600
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,635
Which spell do you want?

601
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,470
Don't worry.

602
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,222
I won't take the Fair Skin Spell.

603
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,141
I wasn't planning to give you that.

604
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,524
I'll take that as
you agreeing to the deal.

605
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,152
-Still--
-Hong-jo.

606
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,285
Please do me a favor.

607
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,543
Okay.

608
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,343
No, you don't have to.

609
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,719
I'll visit Dad first.

610
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,057
Yes, it might look strange
if all three of us leave together.

611
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,519
Okay. See you at the restaurant.

612
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,272
Sin-yu.

613
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:36,275
I might run late.

614
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,236
No. I'll talk to you later.

615
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,286
Why are you here?

616
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,496
That's what I want to ask.

617
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,543
Are you the mayor's daughter?

618
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,711
Yes.

619
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,130
How interesting.

620
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,631
Only for you.

621
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,716
Hong-jo.

622
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,894
I don't think we're close enough
to drink tea together.

623
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,522
It's late, but let me apologize.

624
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,440
I'm sorry.

625
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,525
Why the sudden apology?

626
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,945
You weren't the only one who had it rough.

627
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,947
I had to go overseas too.

628
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,618
I didn't know anyone
and couldn't make friends.

629
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,536
I was so lonely.

630
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,873
You were lonely
because you went to study overseas?

631
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,335
I said I was sorry.

632
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,046
Too bad.

633
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,256
Because I don't believe that you changed.

634
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,717
So I won't believe in your apology

635
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,801
nor accept it.

636
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,304
-Hong-jo.
-Stop.

637
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,017
Have you never
made a mistake in your life?

638
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,437
She apologized. Can't you accept it?

639
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,357
You don't know anything.

640
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,942
I know one thing for sure.

641
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,945
The reason why you eat alone.

642
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,407
The reason might not lie in other people.

643
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:11,578
Let's go.

644
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,639
She transferred to my high school.

645
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,392
Her father was someone's driver.

646
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,937
The students bullied her badly
because she lived in a semi-basement.

647
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,149
She looked so pitiful,
so I approached her first.

648
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,569
But she took the boy I liked from me.

649
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,824
I couldn't endure it.

650
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,577
So I cut off ties with Hong-jo,

651
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,621
and the process wasn't pretty.

652
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,792
My parents got divorced then,

653
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,503
so I was too sensitive.

654
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,053
PARK JU-WON CHEATED WITH A GOLFER

655
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,138
What's this?

656
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,681
Oh, my goodness!

657
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,349
Park Ju-won cheated!

658
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,267
What?

659
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,769
"A stunning golfer 20 years younger."

660
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,480
He's been cheating for two years.
There are photos too.

661
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,982
He's insane.

662
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,859
-Let me see.
-Gosh.

663
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,321
Did Ms. Ma go on leave because of this?

664
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,573
She doesn't take days off often.

665
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,782
MA EUN-YEONG ON LEAVE

666
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,159
You're right.

667
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,494
-Oh, no.
-Be quiet.

668
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,874
GREENWAY

669
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,962
Hey. Let's finish work and talk.

670
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,439
When Eun-yeong was getting married,

671
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,940
I tried to stop her.

672
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,652
He looked like he would cheat.

673
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,987
Now look. He really cheated.

674
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,238
You're right.

675
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,497
I know one thing for sure.

676
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,041
The reason why you eat alone.

677
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,962
By the way,

678
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,090
shouldn't we call Ms. Ma?

679
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm so worried.

680
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,761
The Ms. Ma I know
wouldn't want you to call her.

681
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,721
Let me join the team dinner too.

682
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,016
You startled me.

683
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,436
You're more thoughtless than I thought.

684
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,147
We're not having a team dinner.

685
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,150
We're having a meeting.

686
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,736
I want to join

687
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,655
that meeting too.

688
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,574
Hong-jo.

689
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,369
Today's not the right day for it.

690
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,336
I thought about
what someone told me today.

691
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,339
Everyone makes a mistake.

692
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,426
To what extent should you apologize?

693
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,138
And to what extent can you forgive?

694
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,014
What's this about?

695
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,601
I'm sorry about last time.

696
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,478
It's late, but I apologize.

697
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,857
It was my third day as a civil servant.

698
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,360
I didn't know
your mother passed away that day.

699
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,196
I also didn't know
the envelope had condolence money.

700
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,615
-If I had known--
-Sit down.

701
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,119
-Pardon?
-Shut your mouth and sit down.

702
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,912
Gosh, Mr. Kwon!

703
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,875
Do you have team dinners
in a place like this too?

704
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,669
You sure are wholesome.

705
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,088
Who is that with you?

706
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:52,674
Haven't you read the email?

707
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,260
He's Jang Sin-yu, our new legal advisor.

708
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,515
He looks better in real life.

709
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,143
He's so handsome I couldn't recognize him.

710
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,061
We must be meant to cross paths.

711
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,271
Let's eat together.

712
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,398
-No, we'll--
-Put the tables together.

713
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,483
Okay.

714
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,817
-Come on.
-Okay!

715
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,574
Come here.

716
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,043
Excuse me.

717
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,837
I've been dying to know.

718
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,714
Can I ask you a question?

719
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:38,094
The post on the City Hall message boards
complimenting Hong-jo.

720
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,181
You didn't post it,

721
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,391
did you?

722
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,144
I posted it.

723
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,062
What?

724
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,067
I visited the Dong-gu Office often
to see the district head.

725
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,444
And I liked how she treated
those who filed complaints.

726
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,748
Why would you compliment that?

727
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,711
Aren't all civil servants supposed
to be nice to citizens?

728
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,467
I'm sorry. We'll get going first.

729
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,052
What? Why…

730
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,556
Why are you leaving?

731
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,106
What do we do?

732
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,024
She seems very drunk.

733
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,484
What do I do?

734
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,238
I misjudged you completely.

735
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,657
I thought you were foolish.

736
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,325
But you're a fox.

737
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,080
Stop being flirtatious at work.

738
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:48,832
Public service

739
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,501
isn't easy, so keep that in mind.

740
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,088
Everyone!

741
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,465
Stand up now.

742
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,509
-The second round is on me!
-Whoa!

743
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,136
That's good.

744
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,558
Let's go to karaoke.

745
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,475
Watch out.

746
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,146
Where are you going?

747
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,690
We have a meeting to hold.

748
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,650
We'd like you to go home.

749
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,445
See you tomorrow.

750
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,571
Let's go.

751
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,448
See you tomorrow.

752
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,074
-Let's go.
-Yes.

753
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,419
Hong-jo.

754
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,634
Can you come with me for a second?

755
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,888
Sure.

756
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,603
I bought it earlier.

757
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,688
Your shirt got dirty because of me.

758
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,984
I washed it and it's fine now.

759
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,236
Thank you anyway.

760
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,991
Your face is red whenever I see you.

761
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,952
Is it owing to your name?

762
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,580
No.

763
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,625
I become red
only in front of someone I like.

764
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,137
Did what I say just now
sound like a love confession?

765
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,225
Yes, it did to me.

766
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,309
Was it not?

767
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,314
Well…

768
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,610
Actually,

769
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,113
it is.

770
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:49,035
I had no idea that you were interested

771
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,745
in me too.

772
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,124
Honestly speaking,

773
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,502
since I was in Onju Dong-gu Office, I--

774
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,920
I like you too.

775
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,924
Really?

776
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,803
But I like you as a person.

777
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,890
If someone deserves
a compliment, I'll make a post.

778
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,352
If I dirty someone's clothes,
I'll gift them new clothes.

779
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,942
I'll forget what happened just now.

780
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,320
I hope you won't act awkward
when you see me.

781
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,659
I understand.

782
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,590
In what way was that boy nice?

783
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,806
Did he buy you pens

784
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,766
and tteokbokki?

785
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,605
What do you mean?

786
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,609
I was wondering why you knowingly stole
your friend's boyfriend.

787
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,653
Now I understand.

788
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,240
You're the type to get excited

789
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,576
about the smallest gestures of kindness

790
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:14,245
and confess your feelings impulsively.

791
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,875
What do you even know about me?

792
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,418
What?

793
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,212
I just said what I saw.

794
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:25,757
You're right.

795
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,719
Even the tiniest acts of kindness
excite me and make me happy.

796
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,222
Because nobody is kind to me.

797
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,264
Happy now?

798
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,018
You're right.

799
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,813
Even the tiniest acts of kindness
excite me and make me happy.

800
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,940
Because nobody is kind to me.

801
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,525
Happy now?

802
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,117
I have big news.

803
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,370
Do you remember Lee Hong-jo?

804
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,373
Drink this as you work.

805
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:25,835
Thank you.

806
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,755
Sir, aren't you tired?

807
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,797
Thank you.

808
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,009
-Hello.
-What brings you here?

809
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,302
I'm here to check.

810
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,678
-Is everything fine?
-Yes.

811
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,805
Once we finish this side, we're done.

812
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,432
I'll help too.

813
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,226
You don't have to.

814
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,769
They're so pretty.

815
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,979
-Your clothes will get dirty.
-Don't worry.

816
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,981
It's nothing.

817
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,656
How could she do that to PV?

818
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,284
-Hello.
-Hello.

819
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,579
It's her. What is she going to do now?

820
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,665
Isn't it her? It is, right?

821
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,960
-Seriously.
-Hey, look.

822
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,253
She got turned down.

823
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,171
-So embarrassing.
-Keep it down.

824
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,802
Hold on.

825
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,011
Ms. Lee.

826
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,305
-Yes.
-Did you move all the pots?

827
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,224
-Yes.
-Good work.

828
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,852
Nothing's better than work
to get over the pain

829
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:25,895
of being dumped.

830
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,773
Especially for a tragedy like this,

831
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,651
I think working outside is better
than working inside.

832
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,070
I only had a sip.

833
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,738
Drink this and cheer up.

834
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,615
Thank you.

835
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,867
Let's talk upstairs.

836
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,881
Gosh, I feel sorry for her.

837
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,304
It's not me.

838
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,972
-Liar.
-It's not me.

839
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,807
Who is it then? Me?

840
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,267
Mr. Kwon?

841
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,436
Do you really need proof?

842
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,026
"Ninth-grade civil servant
dumped before confessing love."

843
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:18,156
The angle of the picture
proves that I didn't take it.

844
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,805
MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG

845
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,575
What's this?

846
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,327
"For Lee Hong-jo"?

847
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,176
LEE HONG-JO

848
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,235
Farming is so difficult.

849
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,155
We started raising
chickens, ducks, and goats too.

850
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,115
That's pretty fun.

851
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,367
They even gave birth to their younglings.

852
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,620
They're small and cute.

853
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,709
Anyway, I sent you
a lot of stuff, so eat well.

854
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,919
They're all organic.

855
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:55,104
GOAT MILK

856
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:02,695
I like this.

857
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,572
"Love Spell."

858
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,118
"Be neatly dressed."

859
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,246
"The milk of a goat
with deep maternal love."

860
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,374
I like you too.

861
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,169
But I like you as a person.

862
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,797
I'll forget what happened just now.

863
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,133
I hope you won't act awkward
when you see me.

864
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,792
"Love Spell."

865
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,505
"It's a spell to win the love
of someone you like.

866
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,466
Before casting the spell,

867
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,427
cleanse your mind and body by bathing.

868
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,096
Be neatly dressed.

869
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,812
Do it quietly at night

870
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,439
when the moon is at the highest.

871
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:50,803
Pour the milk of a goat
with deep maternal love into brassware.

872
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:58,853
Add canola honey,

873
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,481
powdered poria mushrooms,

874
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,109
dodder seeds…

875
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,781
and a red rosebud."

876
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:20,708
LOVE SPELL

877
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,122
"When the rose
starts to bloom in the milk,

878
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,963
burn this page
and mix it with the ingredients."

879
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,402
DESTINED WITH YOU

880
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,736
"It'll become a love potion.

881
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,322
Make the person you want
to charm drink it."

882
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,783
You must've believed
in such a superstition.

883
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:26,036
You said it was mine.
It doesn't matter how I use it.

884
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,414
You promised to give me one spell.

885
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,957
I want my spell today.

886
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,877
Let us disappear for a day.

887
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,880
-Can we meet after work tomorrow?
-Me?

888
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:37,631
What should I do?

889
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,843
I think the Love Spell worked.
