Sun Weiyi.

00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,880
Are you trying to play dirty
even in games like these?

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,800
I just want

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,000
to use the washroom.

7
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,079
What do you want?

8
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:17,360
Don't be scared.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,399
Since we have to
keep each other company tonight,

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,079
I'll ask and you'll answer.

11
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:24,360
Okay.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,239
Ask me, then.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,639
Weiyi, have you ever loved me

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,760
when we were a couple?

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,479
I'll tell you the answer right now!

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,119
I haven't!

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,639
I was ignorant in the past.

18
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,000
It's because your elder sister
stole my boyfriend from me.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,560
I only dated you

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,599
to get back at her.

21
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,560
I have never liked you.

22
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,000
You are truly ruthless.

23
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,599
There's no need for you
to think about them again.

24
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,080
We need to learn how to be mature,

25

how to grow up,

26
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,040
and how to let go of the past.

27
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:55,000
Why are you avoiding me

Tell me the truth.

How did it go with Bai Zeliu last night?

Did you hit a home run?

I just don't get it.

this is Weiyi.

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,080
Could you

63
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,919
lend me some money?

(Jiaze Computer Store)
Your shoelace is tied.

Be careful next time.

66
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,000
Excuse me.

67
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you work as
a computer purchasing agent?

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right.

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,279
I've been working the entire afternoon.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,679
But I didn't get a single customer.

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,360
Is that so?

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
I went to a tech company

73
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,600
when I was looking for a job.

74
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,520
I heard from their HR department

75
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
that they need a lot of them.

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,360
Is that so?

77
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,160
Where is it?

78
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,759
I just came to this city not long ago.

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm not really familiar with the place.

80
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,800
But I am.

81
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,800
That's great!

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,080
He's not a miser.

83
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
He just has a budget.

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,839
You were doing financial planning

85
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,479
over the money you spent

86
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,479
in your prime.

87
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,440
No ordinary woman can tolerate that.

88
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,360
Nobody is perfect.

89
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
We have to tolerate one another somehow.

90
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,800
You're just suppressing yourself.

91
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,240
By the way,

92
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,080
I have two tickets
to the opera performance.

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,919
Do you want to join me?

94
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,279
Q!

95
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,160
I love you!

96
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,839
To live and die

97
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,199
for the sake of love.

98
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,639
Carmen was so charming!

99
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,479
Yeah.

100
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,440
It's been a long time since I've enjoyed
such a wonderful performance.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,399
It feels great
hanging out with me, right?

102
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,600
Let me awaken your desire.

103
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,839
Mind your words.

104
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,960
I was just afraid

105
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,559
that you might become a boring person

106
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,919
and achieve nothing in life

107
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,320
after spending too much time
with that blockhead of yours.

108
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,360
Cut it out.

109
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,199
But I have to thank you for today.

110
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I didn't expect you to purchase
the VIP seating.

111
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,320
It must be expensive.

112
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,039
I'll treat you to some
Japanese food next time.

113
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,679
Don't mention it.

114
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,720
My friend gave me the tickets for free.

115
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,760
It's fine as long as you're happy.

116
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:22,555
Hello?

117
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,519
Q,

118
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:24,559
the performance is over, right?

119
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,399
That means
you've accomplished your mission.

120
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,239
You may go now.

121
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,799
Don't give yourself away.

122
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,760
Find an excuse and leave immediately.

123
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,119
Mr. Bai is waiting.

124
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Understood.

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,559
Oh no.

126
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,000
My dog just ripped my sofa apart.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,160
I have to go.

128
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, then.

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,600
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

130
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,079
Weiyi, why are you walking alone

131
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,440
in the middle of the night?

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,640
I was taking a walk.

133
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Don't you think

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
it's dangerous for a woman

135
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,519
to take a walk

136
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,480
at this hour alone?

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
As long as you don't show up,

138
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,519
I'm safe.
