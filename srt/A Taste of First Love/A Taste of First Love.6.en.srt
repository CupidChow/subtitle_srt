3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,680
What a coincidence.

4
00:00:17,799 --> 00:00:21,280
I was told there were no other guests.

5
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,239
Wait.

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,280
Why are you here?

7
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:25,680
Team building.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Enjoy.

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,399
I'm leaving.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,919
Weiyi.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,319
Thank you.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,919
Don't mention it.

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,200
Are you here alone?

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
No.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,759
My boyfriend is here with me.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,959
Where is he?

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
He's coming soon.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,880
I remember
your boyfriend is quite stingy.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,119
I guess

20
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,319
it's rare for him to bring you here.

21
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,439
Stop being a snob!

22
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,519
My boyfriend is very romantic.

23
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,040
Are you hungry?

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,879
No.

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,400
I have some meat dishes at my place.

26
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:16,519
Do you want some?

27
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,639
So well-prepared.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,440
They only serve vegan food here.

29
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:22,639
Didn't your boyfriend
prepare some meat for you

30
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:24,080
before he brought you here?

31
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,319
I'm on diet.

32
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,000
So, no thanks.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
Let go of me.

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,440
Fine.

35
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,239
We have all the things

36
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,319
that you mentioned.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
If you want them now,

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,160
I can go back to the office
and take photos for you right away.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,519
No worries.

40
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,680
Sure. Sure.

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,519
Okay.

42
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,000
Weiyi,

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,279
you lied.

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,919
Your boyfriend
doesn't care about you at all.

45
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:05,760
I guess he didn't spend

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,160
much time planning this trip.

47
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,759
It's okay.

48
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,119
It's not troublesome at all.

49
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,919
Look.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,240
Even now,

51
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,919
what he cares about
is still his sales performance.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,000
I guess you are nothing

53
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,639
in his heart.

54
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,679
What do you know about us?

55
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,800
He is working hard.

56
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,600
He never takes shortcuts.

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,679
You are great at deceiving yourself.

58
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,520
Don't you think

59
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm much better than him?

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't think so.

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,880
I think my boyfriend is the one for me.

62
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
And you

63
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,360
are a stranger.

64
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,399
Let me go.

65
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,039
You are shouting.

66
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,119
Do you want everyone to hear us?

67
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,919
Everyone must think

68
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,479
we are doing that stuff publicly.

69
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,119
Isn't this exciting?

70
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
You are shameless!

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Well, I don't mind.

72
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,080
I can show everyone.

73
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
I don't want to.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,199
Okay, I got it.

75
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,080
Fine.

76
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:29,759
Tell the receptionist

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,000
to turn the lights up in the hallway.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,720
And

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,679
send a set of meat dishes

80
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:38,039
to Miss Sun's room.

81
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,679
Weiyi.

82
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,880
This doesn't add up.

83
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,080
Why are your savings

84
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,119
so much less this month?

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
Didn't I tell you?

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,160
I damaged the clothes that I borrowed

87
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,199
so I had to compensate them.

88
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,720
What's wrong with you?

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,399
You didn't save much last month.

90
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,639
It's so much less this month.

91
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,119
At this rate,

92
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:58,720
when will we be able

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,160
to pay for a down payment
for our apartment?

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,199
What's wrong with us
renting an apartment now?

95
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,639
Take it slow.

96
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,679
Anyhow, I'll save some money.

97
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,919
Take it slow?

98
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,960
Most of my colleagues

99
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,759
have already made
the down payment for theirs.

100
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,399
They can be considered an urbanite now.

101
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,320
We are running slow.

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,919
By the way,

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,320
you have bought

104
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,399
too many clothes

105
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,359
and makeup products!

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,679
Can't you save a little more on that?

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,760
Ren Mingyuan.

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm a cosmetic sales representative.

109
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,279
It's my job to dress decently.

110
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,839
I'm not spending your money.

111
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,720
Why do you care?

112
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Do you remember what you said

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,440
while pursuing me?

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,079
You said you loved
to see me dressing up.

115
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,320
We've been together for so long.

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
I don't care about that anymore.

117
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,959
Save the money
that you spend on those things.

118
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Many a little makes a mickle.

119
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,880
I don't want to.

120
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,548
Hello?

121
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,399
Dad.

122
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,279
Didn't I just give you money?

123
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,440
Why did you use it up so quickly?
