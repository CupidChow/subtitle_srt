00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,640
Bai Zeliu,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
aren't you supposed

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,960
to be dating Liang Wanqing?

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,399
Why did you come here?

7
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:18,360
Weiyi,

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,600
where did you

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,879
get the lover boy?

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,799
His acting skill sucks.

11
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:23,280
Acting skill?

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,959
I don't get it.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,520
He is my new boyfriend.

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:26,920
Weiyi,

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,680
you think the right side
of your face is the prettiest.

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,360
So when you
are holding hands with a man,

17
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,280
you always use your right hand.

18
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,319
That lover boy

19
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,720
doesn't even know about this.

20
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:34,560
You...

21
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,200
Weiyi, are you jealous?

22
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,119
Don't worry.

23
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,119
I have nothing to do with Liang Wanqing.

24
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,439
We were only talking about business.

25
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,159
If you hadn't ignored me,

26
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,159
I wouldn't do this to you.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,159
My girlfriend

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,959
is good in every way,

29
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,400
but she comes from a poor family.

30
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
If I were to spend my life with her,

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,479
it'd be such a stressful life.

32
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:55,880
You are just a sales girl now,

33
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,439
you don't deserve him.

34
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,599
Well,

35
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,639
you should know your status.

36
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,520
Am I right,

37
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,559
the once-glamorous Miss Sun?

38
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,519
Besides,

39
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,919
it was Dai that came up with this idea.

40
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,040
I have nothing to do with this.

41
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,480
Enough, Bai Zeliu!

42
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:11,400
What you are doing now

43
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,959
means nothing to me.

44
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,839
Are you serious?

45
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,959
I don't like you.

46
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:18,400
I've never liked you.

47
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,080
I don't like you.

48
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,120
And I'll not like you.

49
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,239
What is this?

50
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,319
Let go of me!

51
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:39,879
Are you crazy?

52
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,279
Why are you driving so fast?

53
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,120
Do you want to get killed?

54
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,599
Stop!

55
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,040
You don't like me anyway,

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,480
so we might as well die together.

57
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,800
I am more than happy to be with you

58
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,760
forever.

59
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,120
Are you crazy?

60
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
I don't want to die.

61
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,639
I like you!

62
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,720
I was lying to you.

63
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,800
Then tell me,

64
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,360
why did you dump me?

65
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:14,960
Fine.

66
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,600
We'll meet again in the afterlife.

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,679
No!

68
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,160
I did date you
to get back at your sister,

69
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,479
but after spending some time with you,

70
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,160
I've fallen for you.

71
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:25,800
But back then,

72
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,520
my father was imprisoned
because of his business.

73
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,440
His reputation was ruined.

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,600
I've lost almost everything.

75
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,759
I didn't want that to affect you.

76
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Then tell me,

77
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,919
why are you rejecting me now?

78
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:50,919
Actually...

79
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,720
When we meet again,

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm glad that you've changed a lot.

81
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,600
You've achieved great things
at such a young age.

82
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,360
But the gap between us

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
has become very obvious.

84
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,720
I can't let go of my pride

85
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,320
and don't know
how to get along with you.

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Life is not just about love.

87
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,399
There are a lot of things
that we struggle to get through.

88
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,279
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,559
I didn't know
there was so much on your shoulder.

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,960
But I want to let you know

91
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,320
that I don't care about
those superficial stuff.

92
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
I simply want to be with you.

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
The reason why I have become
so strong now

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,639
is to protect you.
