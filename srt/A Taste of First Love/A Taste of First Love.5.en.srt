00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,760
Mr. Ren,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,800
the apartments of this project are big

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,600
and the environment is good.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,000
Many successful people have bought one.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,560
What do you think?

8
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll think about it.

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,639
This is specially
for our regular customers,

10
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:20,079
you may try it.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,040
Is your company having a promotion?

12
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,280
That's the gift
from our company's anniversary celebration.

13
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:27,639
Can I get one as well?

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,680
Well...

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,120
Those are only available for VIPs

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,479
and our current property owners.

17
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,040
Look,

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,919
I'm going to buy it sooner or later.

19
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,400
That makes me your customer too, right?

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,799
But...

21
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,520
Give mine to him.

22
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,119
Mr. Bai.

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,720
Are you also giving this

24
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:44,520
to your family member, mister?

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,400
You're right.

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
My girlfriend loves this brand a lot.

27
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,360
You treat her so well.

28
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,119
When we go after girls,

29
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,759
it's important to make them happy.

30
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:55,520
Sounds reasonable

31
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,520
but you need to know
the limit in practice.

32
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,919
As a man, no matter
whether we're falling in love

33
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,880
or getting married,

34
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,560
we have to spend money wisely.

35
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,080
If we give them a high expectation
in the beginning,

36
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,400
they'll ask for more in the future.

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,599
You're right.

38
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
Mate, since we hit it right off,

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,360
I have some discount coupons here.

40
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,160
Do you want them?

41
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,400
That's very generous of you.

42
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,590
Alright,

43
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,480
I'll give them to you later.

44
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,270
Thanks.

45
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,800
Weiyi,

46
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,800
we have used up our shower gel, right?

47
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,160
I have bought a new one.

48
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,510
It's a good brand.

49
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,950
You can't find it in supermarkets.

50
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,690
(Shower Gel)

51
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,000
Isn't this shower gel for men?

52
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,910
What do you mean it's for men?

53
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,310
As long as
it cleans our bodies, isn't it?

54
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
I think you're buying it for yourself.

55
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,720
(Bro,)

56
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,510
(I have two spa club tickets.)

57
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,680
(I was supposed to go with my friend,)

58
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,270
(but he's on a business trip.)

59
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,950
(Do you want them?)

60
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,400
(Sure,)

61
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,310
(I can use those
to butter up my girlfriend.)

62
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,040
Weiyi,

63
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,480
let's have a spa session this weekend

64
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,160
to relax.

65
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Spa session?

66
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,270
Is it expensive?

67
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,000
It's alright,

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,880
I've already booked the tickets.

69
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,190
As long as you're happy about it.

70
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,000
That's more like it.

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,190
This place looks quite elegant.

72
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,960
Of course,

73
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,630
I chose this one after much comparison.

74
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,030
Why does it only serve vegetarian food?

75
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,440
I didn't pay attention to it.

76
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,160
I thought since it cost a lot,

77
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,550
they should have everything here.

78
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,390
I didn't expect
we need to bring meat ourselves.

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,520
(I can't eat a meal without meat.)

80
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,830
Baby,

81
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,470
why aren't you eating?

82
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,270
I'm full looking at you.

83
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,470
Can you not make a fuss this time?

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,030
It's not easy for us
to come out and relax.

85
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,080
Here, take a bite.

86
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,670
Ren Mingyuan, am I making a fuss here?

87
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,800
Can't you just

88
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,320
do some research before we come?

89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
It's not your first mistake, you know.

90
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,520
A male chauvinist like me

91
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,190
can't pay attention
to too many of these details.

92
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,320
Hey,

93
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,390
have you reached the club?

94
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,750
Yes.

95
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
I remember you said

96
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
you're in the software business.

97
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,830
The boss of Chicheng Group
is a friend of mine.

98
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,880
He's here too.

99
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,390
Would you like to meet him?

100
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,550
Chicheng?

101
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,600
That's a renowned software company.

102
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,270
Yes.

103
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
Just tell him my name,

104
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,750
he'll surely meet you.

105
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,110
Bro,

106
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,110
you do have an incredible network.

107
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Great.

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,440
My girlfriend is angry at me now.

109
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,960
I'll think of a way to get rid of her.

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,160
Are you sure about that?

111
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,880
Shouldn't you cheer her up first?

112
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,360
Just let her be.

113
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,750
There's a rare chance
in front of me now.

114
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,360
Then what about her?

115
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,470
Career comes first.

116
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,240
Relationships can wait.

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,270
When I'm rich,

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
I can get whatever girlfriend I want.

119
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,910
I salute that.

120
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,110
All right then.

121
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll send you his number.

122
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,240
All right.

123
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,670
What's wrong?

124
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,320
Weiyi,

125
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,350
one of my customers is here too.

126
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,550
He's asking me out.

127
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,760
I'll come back
once the business is done.

128
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,480
You won't stay if I say no anyway.

129
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,640
Baby,

130
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,670
just this once.

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,670
It won't happen again.

132
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,640
It feels so nice.

133
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,350
What a coincidence.
