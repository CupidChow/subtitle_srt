Boss,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Miss Sun just contacted me
regarding the takeover

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of the project.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,600
Doesn't she have your contact?

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,920
Why didn't she directly contact you?

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,280
Boss,

9
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,959
I had a fight
with my girlfriend recently too.

10
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:20,319
But I gave her some sort of stimulation,

11
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,079
then we're back to normal.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,120
Stimulation?

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,600
That's right.

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,719
You can't always
beg for women's forgiveness.

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Sometimes, they just need some stimulation.

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,120
If they are jealous,

17
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,840
that means you still stand a chance.

18
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:39,360
Liang Wanqing,

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,599
I can allow Lvhe Fruit Company

20
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:42,959
to open a shop
on our HB E-Commerce platform

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,360
with the condition

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
that you have to help me.

23
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,400
Miss Weiyi,
the meeting is starting soon.

24
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,520
Starting soon?

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,720
Isn't it tomorrow?

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,840
No.

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
A few days ago, you said

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,639
we were going to have a meeting
about the new products today.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,919
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:09,639
I have forgotten.

31
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:11,919
You look distracted.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,599
Our cosmetics for this season

33
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,480
mainly focus on the earth tone
in the autumn and winter season.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,839
We'll use this warm and elegant
color tone

35
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,480
to highlight
women's beauty and independence.

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,319
Most importantly,

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,760
it'll build hype for our lipsticks
of the Awakening series.

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,239
We anticipate the total sale
to be 10 million.

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,839
What about the model?

40
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,700
(Liang Wanqing, trending
Internet celebrity model)

41
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,559
It's her?

42
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,839
You're following
her news as well, Miss Weiyi?

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,839
Liang Wanqing is a graduate of

44
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,040
Business Administration
at Harvard University.

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,559
Her style can be cool and lovely.

46
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,120
Too bad management

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,080
is not her thing

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
and she's interested in
the entertainment industry.

49
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,440
Having been surrounded
by fashion since young,

50
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,879
her taste is extraordinary.

51
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,720
Her social media has
tens of millions of followers.

52
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,040
Her influence is as much as
a popular artist nowadays.

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,519
She's born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

54
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,480
For her, work is all about fun

55
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,720
and nothing else.

56
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,599
The paparazzi even caught her

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,800
having dinner with
Bai Zeliu last night.

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,199
For people like her,

59
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,839
work is just like a game to play.

60
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,039
We need to think this through.

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,520
From Mina's perspective,

62
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,279
all we want is their capability
to market our products.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,759
I think Liang Wanqing
is an ideal choice for us.

64
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,440
Miss Sun,

65
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,000
I think we've met before.

66
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,639
Yes,

67
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,440
at HB's lift.

68
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,399
Why didn't you

69
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,399
take the lift
with Mr. Bai and me that day?

70
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,160
You two love birds
were having a sweet time, right?

71
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,399
I didn't want to be the third wheel.

72
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,759
What an experience you've got
from the sales industry.

73
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
You're sharp-sighted.

74
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,399
Don't worry.

75
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,240
I won't spread rumors to the press.

76
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,759
I don't mind

77
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,800
because Zeliu and I
are getting engaged soon.

78
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,440
You!

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,080
My bad,

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,800
I didn't hold it steadily.

81
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,759
Would you like some tea?

82
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm good.

83
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,880
You better be careful.

84
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,559
Miss Liang,

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,119
as our contract model,

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,160
you might want to
show some professionalism.

87
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,600
After all,

88
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
many people are eyeing you
in the company.

89
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,919
There's one more thing
I would like to tell you.

90
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,039
You can lead a horse to water,

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,279
but you can't make it drink.

92
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,720
What are you trying to say?

93
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,479
Don't misunderstand me, Miss Liang.

94
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,720
Your lips are too dry.

95
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,279
I have a lipstick

96
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,440
which suits you well.

97
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,839
Take it as a gift
for our first cooperation.

98
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,320
Looking forward to working with you.

99
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:12,479
Alright.

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,639
Let's take a break.

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,200
Miss Liang,

102
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
is there anything you would like to eat?

103
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll ask Q to order it for you.

104
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,920
It's fine.

105
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,359
I'll be eating with my boyfriend.

106
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:34,920
Good for you.

107
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,799
Zeliu.

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,480
What is it?

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,839
Nothing much,

110
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,760
I just want to show you

111
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,000
my working place.

112
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,200
Look at my outfit.

113
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,559
Miss Sun chose it for me.

114
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,239
Do I look nice?

115
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:46,880
Not bad.

116
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,679
Miss Sun,

117
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
I called you so many times

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,679
last night.

119
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:53,720
Why didn't you pick up?

120
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,239
My handphone was out of battery.

121
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
What's the matter?

122
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,079
Nothing special,

123
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,359
I just want to recommend my girlfriend

124
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,399
to be your company's model.

125
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,559
Even if you don't,

126
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,920
we'll hire her too.

127
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
Zeliu,

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,679
I'm feeling cold.

129
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,519
Feeling better now?

130
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,440
This photo is quite special.

131
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,880
This is not bad.

132
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,600
What about this one?

133
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,119
You look good too.

134
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,040
What about this?

135
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Showing off affection
during working hours,

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
really?

137
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,320
Miss Sun,

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,279
I hope you don't mind.

139
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,079
My boyfriend cares a lot about me.

140
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,799
Whatever I want,

141
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,720
he'll give the best to me.

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,959
I understand.

143
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
Zeliu,

144
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,399
I'm hungry.

145
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,200
Let's eat.

146
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:58,839
All right.

147
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,959
Would you like to join us, Miss Sun?

148
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,880
I happen to have some questions

149
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,839
regarding the products.

150
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,559
I need your opinions on those.

151
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,559
I think it's not too appropriate.

152
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Just come with us, Miss Sun.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
My boyfriend is a workaholic.

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,519
I don't mind it.
