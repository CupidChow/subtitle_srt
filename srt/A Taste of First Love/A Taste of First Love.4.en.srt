3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,639
Weiyi, didn't your boyfriend
keep you company

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,200
when you watched "Carmen",
your favorite opera performance?

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,399
He was busy with work.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,760
There are only

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,520
two possibilities if a man

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,440
has no time

9
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:25,680
for the woman he loves.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,559
First, he doesn't actually love you.

11
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,000
Second, he's too incompetent for you.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,760
In my eyes,

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,279
my boyfriend is the best.

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,319
Weiyi, you said the same thing

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,880
about me back then.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,119
Let me send you home.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
You can stop here.

18
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,880
There's still some distance

19
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,360
before we reach your place, you know?

20
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,959
My boyfriend might be home.

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,439
I don't want him to misunderstand us.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,279
You're finally back.

23
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,319
I was worried about you.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,319
Q asked me out tonight.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,839
Mingyuan,

26
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm so tired.

27
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,239
Dear,

28
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,760
I suddenly remembered

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,160
that I haven't returned
the shared bike yet.

30
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:46,015
Just forget about it.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,440
That won't do!

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,680
Hello?

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,160
I can see that your boyfriend

34
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
is locking his yellow bike.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
Were you following me?

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
I was just curious.

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,039
Weiyi, I think you walked home

38
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,440
because you missed the last bus
after finishing

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,639
the opera performance, right?

40
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,440
That's none of your business.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Your boyfriend didn't even pick you up
at this late hour.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,919
Does he really love you?

43
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,240
Our relationship has
nothing to do with you.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,839
Weiyi,

45
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,679
are you truly happy right now?

46
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,360
Sir,

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,119
how did it go?

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,279
It was hard for me
to get my hands on the tickets.

49
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,800
("Carmen" Opera Performance VIP Ticket)

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,000
Weiyi,

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
did you watch the opera performance?

52
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:02,919
Yeah.

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,039
I thought we promised

54
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,399
not to exceed our monthly budget?

55
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,199
We still have to pay the deposit
of our first apartment together,

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:07,800
am I right?

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,479
I didn't spend a single cent on it.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,320
Q's friend

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
gave us the tickets for free.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,800
Q?

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
She's just a clerk.

62
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,919
Where did she get herself
such a generous friend?

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,679
Could it be that someone
is trying to court you two?

64
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,559
That's impossible.

65
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,399
Q and I have nothing.

66
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,839
Why would they try to court us?

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
People's hearts are unpredictable.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,039
Anyway, we shouldn't owe them any favor.

69
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,199
You'll have to repay them eventually.

70
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,199
Don't you think you're overthinking it?

71
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,960
You're not relaxed when you should be.

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,479
But haven't we always been
living like this?

73
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,119
Yes.

74
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,520
But sometimes,

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,119
I do think that it's exhausting.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,279
I think you must have been
too busy with work lately.

77
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,639
You need to calm down.

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,440
(Weiyi, are you)

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
(truly happy right now?)
