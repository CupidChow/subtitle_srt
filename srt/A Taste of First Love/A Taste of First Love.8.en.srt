It's been a long time.

Weiyi,

long time no see.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,120
Last time, you mentioned
getting some clients.

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,879
I have some connections here.

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,159
Really?

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,159
Of course.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,639
All of them are high-end clients.

Including

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,360
the chief director of Miss Beauty.

17
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,000
Miss Beauty.

18
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,639
This make-up show is very popular.

19
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,880
It will be great

20
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
if they use our products.

21
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,439
Exactly.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,319

don't want to talk about work.

35
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,000
Understand.

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why don't we catch up a little?

37
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,000
Here.

38
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,800
It's time for us to catch up.

39
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,400
Weiyi,

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,160
I have seen a lot of
beautiful saleswomen.

41
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,360
But it's my first time meeting

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,760
someone like you

43
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,319
who is pretty and stylish.

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,879
I like it.

45
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm flattered.

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,639
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

47
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,639
No problem.

48
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:09,534
Hello?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,679
Where are you?

50
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Shishang Restaurant.

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,759
That's not far from HB.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,399
Buy me a meal, Weiyi.

53
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,880
I'm in the middle
of a meeting with a client.

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,679
Maybe another day.

55
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,639
Client?

56
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,559
I can be your client.

57
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,279
What kind of clients
are you looking for?

58
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,160
I can introduce them to you.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,639
There's no need.

60
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,759
I can do it myself.

61
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,880
You are all mine now.

62

Mr. Bai, Mr. Bai.

66
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,160
I don't know Sun Weiyi is your girl.

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,240
Well, now you know.

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
But I'm still mad.

69

Tell me!

70
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,759
Where did you touch her?

71
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,919
I merely touched her hand.

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Dai, call the police.

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,240
