Tell me.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,760
How long has it lasted?

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,479
It only started

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,719
after our breakup.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,799
It's been five years, you know?

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,319
You're too empty inside...

9
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,520
If so,

10
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,680
where did you purchase them from?

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,639
Did you hire someone
to make them for you?

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,119
Of course I made them myself.

13
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:51,240
How could I hire someone else
to do this?

14
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,119
Luckily, no one else saw them.

15
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,599
If not, I'll be thoroughly embarrassed.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
I'll confiscate all of them then.

17
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:01,119
No!

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,160
They're my food for thought!

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,720
They keep me company

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,120
until I sleep every night.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,519
How could you be so despicable?

22
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,959
At most, I'll pay you
for your portraiture right.

23
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,599
Do you think I care about your money?

24
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,360
Destroy them immediately!

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,959
No way!

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,599
No way!

27
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,120
Stop!

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,839
It's useless for you to destroy them.

29
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:15,959
I can draw again.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,559
Why don't you

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
learn to draw from me?

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,279
That way, you can draw my portraits.

33
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,120
When you learn figure painting,

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,279
the most important thing is to understand
the figure's bone structure

35
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,480
and muscle structure,

36
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,199
such as

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
their eyebrows,

Bai Zeliu wanted.)

(I'm sure he will never expect this.)

Come in.

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,320
We meet again.

58
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,639
Seems like you do like to pester Zeliu.

59
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,360
Bai Lingfei?

60
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,759
What are you doing here?

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,880
Where's Bai Zeliu?

62
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,839
Zeliu is dating the daughter
of the chairman of Lvhe Fruit Company.

63
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,279
I was afraid that insensible people
might hinder their date.

64
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,800
That's why I stayed behind.

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,160
A date?

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,679
People should know their limitations.

67
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,399
Although you've been close to Zeliu

68
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,000
for the past few days,

69
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,360
it's common for men

70
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,679
to fool around.

71
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,839
In the end, they have to marry someone

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
with an equal social rank.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,639
Your brother and I broke up long ago.

74
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,919
That's for the best.

75
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,160
Now, you're just a sales representative.

76
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,839
You're not good enough for him.

77
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,520
You see,

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,720
we should be clear about
our own social rank.

79
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,639
Don't you think so,

Look.

82
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,600
Your necktie isn't straight.

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,919
And here.

84
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,199
There's dust.

Liang Wanqing,

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
I've told you many times.

87
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,519
I'm not interested in you.

88
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,839
I heard from your sister

89
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,480
that an old woman
had been pestering you.

90
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,200
That's none of your business.

91
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,839
But she saw us just now

92
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,679
and left knowing
she couldn't compare with me.

93
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,359
Sun Weiyi,

94
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,480
do you know how old you are right now?

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,679
Stop hallucinating about the impossible.

96
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,600
He is a young and talented man

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
while she is the daughter of a chairman.

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,359
They are

99
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
a perfect match.

100
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,959
You have no way to compare with her.
