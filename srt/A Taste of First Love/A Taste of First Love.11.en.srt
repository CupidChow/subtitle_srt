00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,239
Mr. Bai, here's our promise.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,319
If Huarong

5
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:10,439
can become one of the merchants
for HB E-Commerce,

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,760
we'll make sure to provide the consumers

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,000
with the most reasonable prices

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and the best experience.

9
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,479
Very good.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,159
But I have one more condition.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,959
Please tell us.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,719
I need you guys to redesign
your brand packaging

13
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,879
and include the logo of HB E-Commerce.

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,840
No problem.

15
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,000
Sun Weiyi,

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,879
you can stay here

17
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,000
and assist Mr. Bai

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,079
for the time being.

19
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,360
All right.

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,799
Bai Zeliu,

21
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,200
why did you tell Liu Yinshu

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
that I was the one who clinched
the deal with HB E-Commerce?

23
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,599
It's because I knew

24
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,720
you hadn't hit your sales target yet.

25
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,279
That's why I'm giving
the deal to you for free.

26
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,759
Don't you like it?

27
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,319
It's your loss if you don't take it.

28
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,279
(He does have a point.)

29
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,520
(It'll be my loss if I don't take it.)

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,880
Don't worry.

31
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,639
Mina won't disappoint you.

32
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:01,880
Mr. Mike,

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,559
we have made your products
available for purchase,

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,279
and we will provide you
with first-class logistic services.

35
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,680
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

36
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,839
Has HB E-Commerce already entered
the European and American market?

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,120
It must've been tough

38
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,440
when you first started your company.

39
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,040
Of course.

40
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,639
Back then, 90% of those big shots

41
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:23,400
weren't willing to invest in my company.

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,519
They thought I was a scammer.

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
You? A scammer?

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,760
Maybe it was because of
my qualifications.

45
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,720
I learned programming by myself

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,040
when I was in America.

47
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,400
It was natural for them

48
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,639
to discriminate against me
and not believe in me

49
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,480
as I didn't graduate from a famous university.

50
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,720
If so, why did you persist?

51
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
I persisted because of my dream.

52
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,160
It's because...

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,639
I wanted you to notice me.

54
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,919
That's a great joke.

55
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,000
What are you doing here?

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm working out.

57
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,600
You came all the way north
from the south just to work out?

58
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,240
I love to run around the city.

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,320
Weiyi, I can tell you don't jog often.

60
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,039
You've been jogging for quite some time.

61
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,399
Is there something on your mind?

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
Let's relax.

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,080
Weiyi, since when

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,240
did you start to drink?

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
After I started to work.

66
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,240
I had no choice but to entertain
my clients due to my career.

67
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,800
I learned how to drink eventually.

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,360
Weiyi, I remembered

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
that you said drinking
is bad for our health.

70
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,880
Between surviving
and having a healthy body,

71
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,199
I have no choice but to pick the former.

72
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,119
Weiyi, did you dump me

73
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,880
only to get revenge back then?

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,320
The god of destiny makes fools
of the people indeed.

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,119
Have you ever regretted your decision?

76
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,720
That's a secret.
