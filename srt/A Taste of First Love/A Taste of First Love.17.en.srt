Ms. Sun,

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,680
I'm going vegan this year.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
I can't stand
looking at meat dishes as well.

7
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,040
It's okay.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,680
I'll go vegan with you.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,239
Thanks, honey.

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,600
What about you, Ms. Sun?

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,559
I'm fine too.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:27,319
(How pretentious.)

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Miss Liang is pretty and kind.

15
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,319
Mr. Bai is such a lucky man.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,880
Weiyi,

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,400
what's wrong?

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,759
Do you not like the dishes?

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,319
The dishes are quite bland.

20
00:00:56,919 --> 00:00:58,080
I guess

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,720
you like to eat spicy

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,759
or greasy food.

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,759
How do you know?

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,199
Of course, I know.

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,319
I've studied health and beauty therapy.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,599
Look at your nasal tip.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,319
There are clogged pores everywhere.

28
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,639
I guess you don't really
have a diet plan.

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,959
Listen,

30
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:16,519
as a woman,

31
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,959
you should keep your skin clear
and your body in shape.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,599
That's how you get a perfect lover.

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,639
Honey,

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,000
am I right?

35
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,959
Liang Wanqing,

36
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,120
don't go too far.

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,919
It won't work if I don't go this far.

38
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:34,440
Really?

39
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:35,559
Trust me.

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,400
Babe,

41
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
it's hard to meet someone

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,800
as disciplined and perfect as you.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Come on.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
What will those ordinary women think

45
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,879
if you praise me so highly?

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,319
There is only

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
Miss Sun here.

48
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,160
Miss Sun, please don't mind me.

49
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,839
You don't think
I'm implying it's you, right?

50
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,440
Not at all.

51
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm a rather sloppy person.

52
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,760
Unlike Miss Liang,
she's a gorgeous lady.

53
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,239
But I think

54
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
everyone has their way of living.

55
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,559
As long as
they are happy with their life.

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,199
Just like Wang Xifeng
in the Dream of the Red Chamber.

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,639
She may look glamorous on the surface,

58
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,679
but she pretends to be strong

59
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,880
to be capable,
and to have a harmonious life.

60
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,080
However, her husband cheated on her.

61
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,639
She isn't happy at all.

62
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:19,639
So what for?

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,919
I'm not Jia Lian.

64
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm just giving an example.

65
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,000
This isn't an appropriate example.

66
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,119
Why would you think
I'm talking about you, Mr. Bai?

67
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,520
(The Dream of the Red Chamber?)

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
(I've never read that.)

69
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:35,279
(Judging from how ignorant
Liang Wanqing is,)

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,639
(I guess she's not educated.)

71
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,080
(And she thinks)

72
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,119
(she can win against Sun Weiyi?)

73
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Ms. Sun,

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,520
why don't you tell us about the concept
of the online product's

75
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,559
advertising and packaging?

76
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,479
Sure.

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,679
There will be three different styles

78
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,759
for the packaging of our products:

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,919
A mature and elegant style,

80
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,080
a romantic and innocent style,

81
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
and a cool and modern style.

82
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,960
Of these three styles,

83
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,479
we'll further divide them into
bold and dramatic,

84
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,800
retro Hong Kong, China style,
modern mean girl,

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,559
cool and arrogant,
feminine and seductive,

86
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,839
gentle and lazy, sweet and sexy.

87
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,320
A variety of cosmetics

88
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,559
will meet women's needs

89
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,679
for makeup in the market.

90
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,320
(Q,)

91
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,960
(get me a handsome man)

92
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,279

(As soon as possible.)

97
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,039
(On it!)

98
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,960
Mr. Bai,

99
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
that's our concept for the product.

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:58,960
Great.

101
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,440
Look, there's a handsome man.

102
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,639
That one.

103
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,160
Weiyi,

104
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,600
why didn't you answer my call?

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,519
Didn't you say
you are going to eat with me?

106
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,119
Sorry,

107
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,200
I'm caught up with work.

108
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,040
Look at you,
why are you wearing so little?

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
What if you catch a cold?

110
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,160
Here you go.

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Weiyi,

112
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,959
he is...?

113
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,000
Nice to meet you.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm pursuing Sun Weiyi.

115
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,559
She's a great woman,

116
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,480
and she wouldn't fall for me.

117
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
She finally agreed
to have a meal with me today,

118
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,799
but she stood me up.

119
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,079
So I had to come to find her.

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
I see.

121
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,519
So now, can I have her back?

122
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,239
Sure.

123
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,200
We're done here.

124
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,839
Let's go.

125
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:00,000
Really?

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,239
I'm so lucky today.

127
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,279
Weiyi,

128
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
I want you to know

129
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,160
that I'll always make time for you

130
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,399
wherever, whenever.

131
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
Mr. Bai,

132
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,359
it seems like she's not into you at all.
