3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Ren Mingyuan.

4
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:08,680
You are in luck!

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,399
You sealed the deal with Chicheng.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,960
I worked hard for this.

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,640
For sure, you are getting promoted.

8
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:14,720
By the way,

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,319
when are you marrying your girlfriend?

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,799
Marry?

11
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,959
How can I possibly marry her?

12
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,840
If she wasn't
the owner of Sun Group's daughter,

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,000
I would never date her.

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
Didn't the Sun Group
declare bankruptcy long ago?

15
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:31,000
A starved camel is bigger than a horse.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,720
I was planning
to make use of her resources

17
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,680
but she turns out to be a burden.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,080
Brothers are my hands and feet,

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,000
while women are as clothing.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,119
Cheers!

21
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,840
Weiyi.

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,439
Why are you here?

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,919
Weiyi.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,279
Let's talk after we go back home, okay?

25
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:53,599
Guys,

26
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,880
I'm the "princess" of the Sun Group,

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,439
I'm also the useless burden

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,880
with poor family background
as Mr. Ren said.

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,759
It seems like he's about to get rich

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,319
and planning to get rid of me.

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm so lucky.

32
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,000
But

33
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,360
thank you

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,639
for showing me his true intention.

35
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,000
However,

36
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,199
you might look like a gentleman
on the outside

37
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,000
but you talk about women
like they are a piece of clothing.

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,160
What a self-centered and arrogant man

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,599
are you.

40
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,480
Are you really breaking up with me?

41
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,360
The way you treated me
in front of my colleagues

42
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,519
was such a humiliation.

43
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,839
You don't intend to apologize to me

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,720
and now you are chasing me out?

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,879
Why shouldn't I kick you out?

46
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,559
Ren Mingyuan.

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,800
Now I have seen through you.

48
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,400
You are just a selfish

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,720
and hypocritical scumbag.

50
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,480
Sun Weiyi.

51
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:55,480
I admit.

52
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,000
I was drunk and said something
I shouldn't have.

53
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,480
But look at yourself now.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
With your conditions,

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
do you think you deserve me?

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,599
Let's break up then.

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't waste your time on me.

58
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,119
You don't have to pretend to care for me

59
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,399
but in fact,
you are just a stingy person.

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,800
Fine.

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,520
Sun Weiyi.

62
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
Sure, let's break up.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,440
But first,

64
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,399
let's sum up the time and money

65
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,440
that I've spent on you these years.

66
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,039
LV Speedy bag, 6,000 yuan.

67
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,880
You buy me a fake one.

68
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,320
It is worth only 300 yuan.

69
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,160
You brought me to some roadside stall

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,279
on my last birthday.

71
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,080
The store used mutton
that was pumped with water.

72
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,559
I ended up with diarrhea
and spent 2,000 yuan in hospital.

73
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,399
Now, let's calculate
how much I've spent on you.

74
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,360
Your watches and shoes

75
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,759
that I bought are international brands.

76
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,919
They cost at least 10,000 yuan.

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
You just had a haircut in the salon

78
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,399
and paid for it with my VIP card.

79
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,119
Let's round it up.

80
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:57,960
50,000 yuan.

81
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:02,919
Fine.

82
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,199
I was blinded.

83
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,199
Do you still think of yourself
as a high-born?

84
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,250
(When a woman said she doesn't want
to fall in love anymore,)

85
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,375
(do I still have a chance?)

86
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:21,275
(Why do women like a man
who's far inferior to them?)

87
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,175
(What if the woman
doesn't like me back?)

88
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,679
Mr. Bai.

89
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,960
The contract with Chicheng Group

90
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,839
is ready.

91
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,720
Mr. Liang asked

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,559
if you are free tonight?

93
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,520
He wanted to ask you out for a drink.

94
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,479
I'm busy.

95
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,600
Well,

96
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:39,440
Mr. Liang said

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
both of you are single

98
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,399
so you need some opportunities

99
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,279
to meet some girls.

100
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,360
Tonight,

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,839
he asked his friend
to invite some professors,

102
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:45,800
stewardesses, and doctors over.

103
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,440
Every one of them is very good-looking.

104
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,440
I've told you I don't have time.

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm busy.

106
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,839
Tell him, leave me alone

107
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,600
except for business.

108
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,279
Boss,

109
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,479
Miss Sun broke up

110
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,720
with her boyfriend not long ago.

111
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,960
Why didn't you tell her

112
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,679
what kind of person Ren Mingyuan is?

113
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,360
She wouldn't believe
whatever I say about Ren Mingyuan.

114
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,839
Oh,

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,639
how about you and your girlfriend?

116
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,160
We are getting married.

117
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,399
I'm serious about her.

118
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,919
We broke up years ago

119
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,839
but we got back together recently.

120
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,839
You...

121
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,359
What's the trick?

122
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,480
You've come to the right person.

123
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,760
The trick is to ignore her rejection and never give up.

124
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
Is that so?

125
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,440
But I'm doing that already, aren't I?
