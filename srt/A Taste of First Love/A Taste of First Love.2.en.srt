(Five Years Ago)

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,159
Weiyi, did you come to pick me up?

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,960
Bai Zeliu,

6
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,159
it's over between us.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,799
Weiyi, stop joking around.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,319
Let me be honest with you.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,239
I only became your girlfriend

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,719
to seek revenge
against your elder sister

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,200
for stealing my ex-boyfriend.

12
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,360
Weiyi, what are you saying?

13
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:27,920
Bai Zeliu,

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,680
I've never loved you.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,119
You're just a car mechanic.

16
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,080
My father is the chairman
of a business group.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,919
Do you think you're good enough for me?

18
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,599
Stop dreaming.

19
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,279
Treat this

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,479
as my last compensation for you.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,680
No, thanks.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
What? You scared me!

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,919
Baby,

24
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,120
why is your rented designer dress torn?

25
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,199
Doesn't that mean we need to pay them?

26
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,319
Yeah.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm so exhausted today.

28
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,800
I don't wish to talk about this.

29
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:34,559
Baby,

30
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,319
I've just received a bonus
from the company.

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,360
Let's go out tomorrow.

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,239
It'll be my treat.

33
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:40,400
I heard

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,959
that China National Opera House
is performing "Carmen"

35
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,800
on tour.

36
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,720
I want to watch it.

37
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:44,400
Sure.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll book the tickets right now.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
Baby,

40
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,440
the tickets with the group discounts
were sold out.

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,160
We can only buy the tickets
in person tomorrow.

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,760
This price is a little...

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,959
Forget it then.

44
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,000
Baby, you're so thoughtful.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Luckily, I got us

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,319
some steak vouchers
for a Western restaurant.

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,879
Why don't we have Western food tomorrow?

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,400
But my stomach...

49
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,720
Fine then.

50
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,520
Weiyi,

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,240
did you meet the president of HB

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,160
when you attended the industry symposium
a few days ago?

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,960
My ex-colleague sent me
a message yesterday.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
It's a pity that she only took
a photo of his back.

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,600
Let me see.

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,839
He looks great from the back.

57
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,479
He has a thin waist
and a broad shoulder.

58
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,520
Q,

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,559
listen.

60
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,039
Usually, a perfect man

61
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,279
is also a mommy's boy.

62
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,080
You're totally wrong about him.

63
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:39,520
According to the weather forecast,
it will pour tonight.

64
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,440
It will last until tomorrow morning.

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
So, for safety's sake,

66
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,199
we should stay home.

67
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,775
(The cab fare is crazy!)

68
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,450
(I'll spend the night in the company.)

69
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,800
(Take good care of yourself.)

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,080
Come.

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,759
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight.

72
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,800
What about the sober bar downstairs?

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Sure.

74
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,880
Since we're going out,

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,279
we should doll ourselves up.

76
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,000
If not, you'll have to drink
three cups as punishment.

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,479
Let's play something exciting today.

78
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,039
Let's play King and Queen.

79
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,919
The man and woman who draw
the King of Hearts and Queen of Hearts

80
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,080
will become a pair.

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,839
They have to spend the night

82
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,479
in the same room.

83
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,080
What do you guys think?

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
That's a great idea.

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Everyone,

86
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,199
may I join in the fun?

87
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Bai Zeliu, the executive president
of HB E-Commerce?

88
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,960
He's a diamond bachelor.

89
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,839
I'm single

90
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,279
and ready to mingle.

91
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,600
May I join in the fun?

92
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,080
Welcome.

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,479
I think I'll withdraw

94
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,759
from this game.
It's meant for youngsters.

95
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,479
Don't do that.

96
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,600
Everyone here has to join it, right?

97
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,479
After all, that's one of the rules.

98
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,679
The owner of this bar is my friend.

99
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,199
I wish to promote his bar for him.

100
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll foot the bill

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,199
as long as

102
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,520
everyone here

103
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,399
participates in the game.

104
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,800
Nice!

105
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,199
Weiyi,

106
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:00,000
you shouldn't be a wet blanket.

107
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,000
Come on.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,279
Marriage is determined by destiny.

109
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,399
You and I are joined by fate.

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,720
Everyone, you may show your card now.

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,679
You two are our pair for tonight!
