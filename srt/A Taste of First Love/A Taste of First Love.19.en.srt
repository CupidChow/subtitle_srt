Also, why are we dressing like this?

You know nothing.

and his socialite wife from Shanghai?

00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,799
Can we take a photo with you?

25
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,439
That was scary.

26
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,599
I was so afraid.

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,599
Hurry up, stick it on him.

28
