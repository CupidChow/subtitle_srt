Bai Zeliu,

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,200
please don't take to heart

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,639
the words I just said.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,600
That's fine.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,720
After all, you're the one

8
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,560
that made me a true man.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,159
I have other things to attend to.
I'll make a move first.

10
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:56,639
Q,

11
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,000
why do you call me
this early in the morning?

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Check it out on Weibo.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
It's going crazy.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,080
Turns out your client, Qian Kun,

15
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,799
is actually a pervert!

16
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,319
(Qian Kun, chairman of Qian Group,
got arrested due to suspect of rape)

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,199
He asked me out for dinner
a few days ago.

18
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,519
He even forced me to drink.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,040
My goodness.

20
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,519
Are you okay?

21
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm fine.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,080
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

23
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,639
Luckily, he was arrested.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Didn't you say

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,959
that he proposed to
work with you several times?

26
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:24,199
His next target might have been you.

27
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:24,760
Yeah.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,639
That was close.

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,400
I heard some gossip

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,160
saying that his deeds were exposed

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,239
because he offended someone
he shouldn't have.

32
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,199
That's why he was arrested that quickly.

33
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:34,279
(Could it be Bai Zeliu?)

34
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,120
Weiyi,

35
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,279
are you listening?

36
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,760
I have something to do.
I'll hang up now.

37
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,239
Bai Zeliu.

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,839
Do you need anything?

39
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,279
I was careless

40
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,599
around Qian Kun last time.

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,239
Thank you for rescuing me.

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,639
If so,

43
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,639
you should come to my home
and match the clothes for me.

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Match the clothes for you?

45
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,559
That's right.

46
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,959
Weiyi, you're from the fashion industry.

47
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,559
I think you have a good fashion sense.

48
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,600
I can do that for you.

49
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,039
My goodness.

50
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,320
You're a chairman with a net worth
of over 10 million.

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,960
How could your wardrobe be this messy?

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,039
It doesn't suit your identity at all.

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,080
Don't you hire any maids
to do the cleaning?

54
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,600
I don't like it
when strangers enter my room.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,679
I usually call Dai to clean it for me.

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,919
I see.

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,000
So Dai is also a typical man
who has no talent for this, huh?

58
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,360
All right.

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,360

63

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,440
Not bad at all.

I need to attend
a business meeting tomorrow.

66

Please select an outfit for me

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,399
and let me try it.

69

you can pick something
with more vibrant color.
