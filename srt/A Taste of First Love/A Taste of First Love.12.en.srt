00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,239
I missed you very much.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,720
Don't leave me.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,279
Stay here with me.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Da Bai, stop that. Sit down.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,680
Da Bai?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Isn't it the dog from a few years back?

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,840
Dai,

10
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,520
how many times should I repeat?

11
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,840
Now, tell me

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,040
who's the boss here?

13
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,840
List down

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,520
all our clients

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
and send it over again.

16
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:55,400
You need time?

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,319
You have never done that before this?

18
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,080
Where are you going?

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,599
I just want to stand up.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,599
Check all the tags

21
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,319
of Huarong's products

22
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,800
and send me a summary of them.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,720
But there are so many of them.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,599
I need it.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,360
Okay.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,519
Whatever you say.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,400
Mr. Bai,

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,879
here's the summary report.

29
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,239
If there's nothing else,

30
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,080
I'll leave first.

31
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,000
Do you really hate
to spend time with me?

32
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,879
I'm so sad.

33
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,440
You were the one
who wouldn't let go of me

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,919
and said we should
sleep together last night.

35
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,440
I was drunk.

36
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,959
If I behaved weirdly,

37
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,000
please don't take it seriously.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,040
Boss, are you there?

39
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,479
Don't worry.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
Without my permission,

41
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,800
no one will ever come in.

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,440
Don't you have any feelings towards me?

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,320
If I wasn't the one

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,919
who sent you home last night,

45
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:23,960
would you allow others to do so?

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,199
Of course not.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,880
That means
you're falling in love with me too.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
Stop flattering yourself.

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
I don't remember anything
about last night.

50
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,960
But there were only the two of us

51
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,960
and you ran into my arms.

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,919
Isn't that an obvious sign?

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,759
I'll come in now, Boss.

54
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,559
What did I say about never coming in

55
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,320
without my permission?

56
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm sorry, Boss.

57
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,039
This door isn't functioning well.

58
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,440
What is it?

59
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:52,720
Boss,

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,399
the handover between
Chicheng Group and us

61
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,639
is going smoothly.

62
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,880
Boss?

63
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,279
Boss?

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,360
All right,

65
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,720
just follow the procedures.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,240
Okay.

67
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,520
Come out.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,279
My hair!

69
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,479
You...

70
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,759
Unbutton it.

71
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,279
Boss,

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,240
I forgot to take the document.

73
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,240
Boss,

74
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
I didn't see anything.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Bai Zeliu,

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,440
you did it on purpose!

77
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,679
I did it on purpose?

78
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,720
This is to my disadvantage,
don't you see?

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
How could I do it on purpose?

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,679
But I don't want
people commenting about us.

81
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,160
There's nothing to hide
about our relationship.

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,119
Who cares about them?

83
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,119
How about I issue a memo,

84
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,720
saying whoever stands in the way of our relationship,

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,520
their salaries will be deducted.

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
What do you think?

87
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,679
Are you out of your mind?

88
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
I don't want anyone
to affect our relationship.
