Where's my handbag?

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,959
Give it back.

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,360
Isn't it hanging on your shoulder?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,280
Hurry and give it back.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,159
Listen up.

9
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,559
There are many treasures in my handbag.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,360
Let me show you.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm going to make a fortune!

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,680
Listen.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,720
As long as it sells like hotcakes...

14
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,240
No,

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,599
it'll definitely sell like hotcakes.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,840
All right.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,319
Sit properly.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't move.

19
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,919
Let me restore your primal eyebrows.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,199
You look adorable

21
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,519
with your bushy eyebrows.

22
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,680
Why are you laughing like that?

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Enough.

24
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,559
Sit properly.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll get some hangover medicine for you.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,599
Swimming in the vast sea!

27
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,160
Full of water. A toad...

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,760
A toad has four legs!

29
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,839
-When you walk too often in the dark,
-What are you doing?

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,879
you'll encounter ghosts!

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,519
Pass them to me.

32
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:57,959
Come on.

33
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,360
My dear lady,

34
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,319
stop swimming.

35
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:03,879
No.

36
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,239
Come here.

37
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll keep swimming.

38
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,639
I'll bring you to a larger pool later.

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,839
Take your medicine first.

40
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,039
Really?

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,639
Yes.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,279
Take your medicine first.

43
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,800
If so, I want you to feed me.

44
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,240
Here.

45
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:40,759
Are you awake?

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
What time is it?

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,720
Do you know

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,559
that the cake you ate last night

49
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,800
contained peach powder?

50
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,520
I didn't know.

51
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:57,880
Liu Yinshu was the one
who ordered the cake.

52
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,320
I know that.

53
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,440
If so, did you know
she tried to set you up?

54
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,559
What are you guys doing here?

55
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:31,800
You took the words
right out of our mouths.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,119
Ms. Liu,

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,000
what are you doing in Mina's warehouse

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,600
instead of sleeping at this hour?

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,039
Did you guys tail me?

60
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,559
We were suspicious of you

61
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,919
ever since you tried to harm Weiyi

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,479
with the peach cake.

63
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,279
We knew you had conspired
with our rival company in secret.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,240
You hid a needle inside a lipstick.

65
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,639
You've committed the crime
of producing and selling

66
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,119
counterfeit goods.

67
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,279
This can even be considered
malicious assault.

68
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,919
You can be sentenced to jail for this.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,720
You're so vicious.

70
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,080
It's all because of you!

71
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,199
I had been working
in this position tirelessly

72
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,880
for many years!

73
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,800
Now you become my superior

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,039
just because you clinched
a deal with HB!

75
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,000
That's so unfair!

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,199
If you feel wronged,
we can have a fair competition.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,639
However, you infringed

78
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,440
the rights of the consumers
just so you could harm me.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,600
You're so heinous.

80
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:19,431
(Warehouse)

81
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,480
Thank you for saving me
from the embarrassment that day,

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,640
which also helped me
discover Liu Yinshu's plot.

83
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,239
If so,

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,959
Weiyi, can you thank me
with some practical actions?

85
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes, as long as it's within

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,279
my abilities.

87
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
If so,

88
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,760
Weiyi, can you keep me company
at my home for a while?

89
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,959
Do you still remember this?

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,559
I gave it to you

91
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,559
when we first dated each other,
didn't I?

92
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,000
It's been so many years since then.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
You still keep it with you?

94
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,799
You can buy anything you want right now.

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,720
This is different.

96
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,640
You said I was talented at fixing things

97
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,760
when you gave this to me.

98
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,519
You told me to study hard.

99
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,279
After that, I did study hard

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,040
and became

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
a top mechanic in America.

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
After that,

103
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,959
I spent the money I earned

104
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,000
to learn new things about the Internet.

105
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,239
That's how I became who I am.

106
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,720
Yeah.

107
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,559
I knew you were something special.

108
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,040
You will definitely succeed

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
as long as you're willing to work hard.

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
So, Weiyi,

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,359
you're my benefactor.

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
How could I bear to throw away

113
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,440
the things you had given me?

with art?

116
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,519
You have good taste.

117
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:55,519
I drew it on a whim

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,839
just to kill time.

119
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,200
