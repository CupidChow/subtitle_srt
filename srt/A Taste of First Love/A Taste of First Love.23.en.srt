4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,119
Weiyi,

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,720
are you okay?

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,720
If you want to cry,

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,800
I can find somewhere for you to hide.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,120
Don't stay quiet.

9
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:22,440
I'll buy some eggs now.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,680
Let's smash the eggs against them.

11
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:24,719
Q.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Look, our dewy foundation

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,079
is not bad, right.

14
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:33,119
The banana skin hit right on my face.

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,200
But my foundation still looks perfect.

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,720
If this gets on the headline,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,639
we can earn ourselves
a free advertisement.

18
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,599
Weiyi,

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,439
from today onwards, you are my goddess.

20
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:06,639
Sun Weiyi,

21
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:08,639
you just got promoted and this happened.

22
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,279
The damage caused to the company
is beyond measure.

23
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:10,959
Do you get it?

24
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,360
I get it.

25
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,080
It has happened though.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,279
I'll do whatever I can
to make up for it.

27
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,040
Deal with it now.

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,440
Miss Sun,

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,360
our boss said

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,160
you can go in

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,040
whenever you visit.

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
No appointment is needed.

33
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,000
This way, please.

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,000
Thanks.

35
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you really
not attracted to Sun Weiyi?

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
No.

37
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,000
Why would I lie to you?

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,839
I still recall

39
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,319
that you were so heartbroken

40
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,879
just because I gave her
a small punishment.

41
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,000
I was just acting.

42
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:00,120
Sun Weiyi is nothing
but an ordinary girl.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,440
I can find a lot of others
like her on the street.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,800
I am seeking revenge.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
I'll let her depend on me first

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,760
and then I'll dump her

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,279
so she'll know how I felt

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
when she dumped me.

49
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,479
Are you serious?

50
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,839
Of course.

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,759
I can have anything I want now,

52
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,279
including girls.

53
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,240
You are home, Weiyi.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,479
Bai Zeliu,

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
I'm so exhausted already

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,279
that I have no time to deal with you.

57
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,279
What's wrong?

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,520
Why didn't you ask for my help

59
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,279
after such a serious matter
happened today?

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,880
Are you done with your acting?

61
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,919
I feel tired by looking at it.

62
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,559
What other tricks
do you and your sister still have?

63
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,160
You'd better show me everything at once.

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,720
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
I don't get it.

66
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,880
Well, you said

67
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,039
I'm just an ordinary girl

68
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,240
and you can find a lot of others like me
on the street.

69
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,199
And you would

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,679
let me experience
the feeling of being dumped.

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,919
You misunderstood me.

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,039
I'm lying to Bai Lingfei.

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you know
what she is doing behind you?

74
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:36,399
Is it?

75
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,679
What a great actor are you!

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Sun Weiyi,

77
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,360
you don't trust me.

78
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,199
Do you know how much I've done for you?

79
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:46,960
Don't you see it?

80
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,639
I wanted to trust you too

81
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,919
but I'm not deaf.

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,440
All this while,

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
you and your sister
have been teaming up to get back at me

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,199
and fool me around.

85
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,320
Now that you are happy.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,559
You've made it.

87
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,639
Congratulations.

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,919
After all, you don't trust me at all.

89
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
How am I supposed to trust you?

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,679
Bai Zeliu,

91
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,279
it's over.

92
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,839
What do you mean?

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,079
Are you breaking up with me?

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,440
I can't be in a relationship

95
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,720
that's full of plots.

96
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:38,920
Please,

97
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:43,799
spare me.
