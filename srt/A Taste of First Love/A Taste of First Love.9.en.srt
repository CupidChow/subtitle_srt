Sun Weiyi.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,680
It's been so long.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,880
You still can't find a platform
to promote

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,319
our main product,
Huarong's latest collection?

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm getting in touch

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,319
with various famous beauty magazines.

9
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,200
I've spent my weekends having a meal
with their editors.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,760
I believe we'll soon be able
to cooperate with them.

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:20,079
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,479
All I want is the result.

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,159
If you don't get it done by this month,

14
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,760
I'll not approve

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,840
your promotion.

16
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,040
Okay.

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,680
Lingyun Fashion Studio

18
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,639
is an influential fashion team in China.

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Their main customers are celebrities

20
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,080
and socialites.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,720
Now, whether you can get them
on board or not, that's up to you.

22
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:42,319
Bai Lingfei?

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,279
Why?

24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,200
Any problem?

25
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,000
If there's a problem,

26
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,479
I'll have another team take care of it.

27
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
No, no problem.

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,720
Miss Sun,

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,919
you are not
in the socialite circle anymore.

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah,

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm broke now.

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,959
I'm working in sales now.

33
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,839
You are very down-to-earth now.

34
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:11,959
The tricks that you used
to seduce my little brother,

35
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,040
aren't you using them anymore?

36
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,120
Well, tit for tat.

37
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,199
Ms. Bai,

38
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:19,040
that was a long time ago,
but you still remember them so clearly.

39
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,680
I promise

40
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:21,919
we can achieve a win-win situation

41
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
if we cooperate.

42
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:24,800
I see.

43
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,239
You know when it's the time to submit.

44
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:27,919
Follow me, then.

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
I broke my pearl necklace

46
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,279
when I was swimming last night.

47
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,199
They all fell into the water.

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
If you can get them all

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,919
before dawn,

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
I'll work with you.

51
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,599
Promise?

52
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,120
Of course.

Do you believe in Bai Lingfei's words?

59
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,160
I have to give it a try.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
Does your performance matter that much?

61
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,639
Yes.

62
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,960
I'll help you, then.

63
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,000

Ms. Bai,

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,799
I found all 72 pearls.

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,959
Nope.

86
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,359
There's one more.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,559
No way.

88
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,880
I've almost turned the pool upside down.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,480
There's another tiny pearl.

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
You didn't get it.

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,239
I'll look for it now.

92
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry.

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
I said you must get it done before dawn.

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,679
So I'm not working with you now.

Bai Lingfei!

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
You tricked me!

00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,679
Bingo.

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,640
You're right.

99
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,079
A day of hard work,
but still, you didn't seal the deal.

100
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,760
You must feel terrible, right?

101
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm sorry

102
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,279
for letting you down.

103
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,600
Not needing to work
with a cunning person like you

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
is such a blessing.

105

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,559
Do you know how bad

107
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,399
you hurt Zeliu?

108
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,440
I can dump whoever I want.

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
That's none of your business.

110

Zeliu,

111
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,320
you've heard her.

112
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,079
You should go home first.
