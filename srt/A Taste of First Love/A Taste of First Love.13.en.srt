3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,039
Do you understand

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,399
what the client wants?

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,640
Redo it!

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,600
Okay.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,680
Guys, listen to me.

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:15,960
I hereby announce

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,239
that our project has been finished

11
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,479
beyond expectation,

12
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:20,280
Sun Weiyi is promoted to
regional director.

13
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,280
From today onwards,

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,600
she'll be your superior.

15
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,040
Weiyi,

16
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,559
you can do this.

17
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,319
Keep up the good work.

18
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,399
I will!

19
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,319
What is there to talk about?

20
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,000
Get back to work!

21
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,959
Sir,

22
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:38,639
it's not fair.

23
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,319
Why did Sun Weiyi
get promoted to the director position?

24
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,400
Sun Weiyi managed to cooperate with HB

25
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,360
and the profit in return
is unprecedented.

26
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,880
She earned the position herself.

27
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:46,959
On the contrary,

28
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,240
your work performance

29
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,159
hasn't been satisfactory these years.

30
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,040
Shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

31
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,200
You know what?

32
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,959
Sun Weiyi gets promoted

33
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,479
because she is dating HB's CEO,
Bai Zeliu.

34
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
No way.

35
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,560
She looks obedient.

36
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,319
Don't judge a book by its cover.

37
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,319
She has a low educational level.

38
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,360
If she wants to get promoted,

39
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,319
she might use some other shortcuts.

40
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,080
That's pretty shameful.

41
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,000
What are you talking about?

42
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:16,599
Let's go.

43
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,599
Weiyi,

44
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,000
don't be affected by the gossip.

45
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:26,919
Today is your birthday.

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,319
Let's go out and celebrate.

47
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,760
Today is your birthday, Weiyi?

48
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,480
Getting promoted on your birthday,

49
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,720
that doubles the happiness.

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,080
Why don't you invite everyone to a pub

51
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,839
and have fun?

52
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
No problem.

53
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,919
My treat.

54
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,360
Here.

55
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,919
Happy Birthday, Weiyi!

56
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:48,000
Wish you forever young.

57
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:52,239
Here.

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,040
Cheers!

59
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,319
Weiyi, here you go.

60
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,400
Let's have some cake.

61
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,760
Here you go.

62
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Thanks.

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,399
Is it nice?

64
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,919
Come on, let's raise our glass.

65
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,119
Cheers!

66
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,600
It's her birthday today.

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,199
I wonder

68
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,559
if she's spending the night with anyone.

69
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,479
Boss,

70
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,839
my friend saw Miss Sun
and her colleagues

71
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,880
in his newly opened bar.

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,679
Guys,

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
it's my birthday today.

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm so happy.

75
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,880
I want to perform here for you.

76
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,759
Weiyi, you are drunk.

77
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,320
Exactly.

78
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:56,440
Today...

79
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
Q is going to pay

80
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,199
for your bill today.

81
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,199
She's drunk.

82
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,479
No.

83
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
I want to perform.

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,520
Q,

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Weiyi is happy today.

86
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
Let her be.

87
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,600
Shut up.

88
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:11,919
It's itchy.

89
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,800
What is it?

90
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Let me see.

91
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,360
What kind of cake did you buy for Weiyi?

92
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,199
A peach-flavored cake.

93
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,320
She is allergic to peach.

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,199
I don't know that.

95
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,320
Oh, really?

96
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,000
What is she doing?

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,679
She is so drunk.

98
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,520
Oh, my god.

99
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,559
Put on your blazer.

100
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
Listen to me.

101
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,479
Don't touch me.

102
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,399
This is so embarrassing.

103
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,320
Behave.

104
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,039
Stop taking photos.

105
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,279
Why are you taking photos?

106
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,399
Stop it.

107
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,639
Stop!

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:52,720
Stop taking photos.

109
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,639
(If this kind of indecent photos)

Move away.

119
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,360
Hey...

120
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,800
- Stop taking photos.
- What are you doing?

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
Are you crazy?

122
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,799
I've had the signal

123
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,000
blocked here.

124
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,679
Tell the owner,

125
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,399
I'll compensate for all his loss

126
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,119
for tonight.

127
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

128
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,559
Let's go.

129
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,160
Here.

130
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,799
Boss.

131
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,480
Liu Yinshu
brought the peach power with her

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,119
when she picked up the cake
from the bakery.

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,279
She planned the whole incident.

134
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,399
She must be jealous of
Miss Sun's promotion

135
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,519
as this gets in her way.

136
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,160
Okay.

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,040
Get someone
to keep an eye on Liu Yinshu.

138
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,559
Got it.

139
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,279
Bai Zeliu,

140
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,679
I hate you.

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,119
Annoying.

142
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:33,279
Me?

143
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,720
Why do you appear
in my dream every day?

144
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,679
Do I look like someone
who will like your chocolate abs?
