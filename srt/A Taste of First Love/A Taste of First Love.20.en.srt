00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:07,320
Weiyi,

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,039
I tried Lvhe Fruit Company's

5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,520
newly launched pomelo product
during the meeting today.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,840
(Then, my tongue slipped and I asked)

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,159
(if I could keep some of them
for my girlfriend.)

8
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,680
They teased me for it the entire day.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,559
Goodness,

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,840
how could you act like that?

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,399
The chairman of HB E-Commerce

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,040
is talking about
his girlfriend all the time?

13
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,639
Aren't you afraid that people
might say that you're stupidly in love?

14
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:26,159
It doesn't matter to me.

15
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,159
I want everyone

16
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,719
in the world to know

17
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,840
that you're my girlfriend anyway.

18
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,080
Something interesting
happened to me today.

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,959
Let me share it with you.

20
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,400
What was it?

21
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,439
When I watched...

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,759
What's the matter?

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,119
It's nothing.

24
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,200
Weiyi,

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,720
I have work to do.

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,400
All right then.

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,240
You can go ahead.

28
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,759
Bai Zeliu,

29
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,279
is there anything you desire right now?

30
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Of course, it's your heart

31
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,840
if it's for sale.

32
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,239
Stop joking around.

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,959
I'm talking about real things

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,160
like razors and so on.

35
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,319
Weiyi,

36
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,839
Dai always bought

37
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,680
my daily necessities for me.

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,760
I don't really desire material stuff.

39
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,519
If so, what wish do you have?

40
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,839
Except for me.

41
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,919
Maybe an interplanetary journey.

42
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,000
I like space.

43
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:30,599
When I read about space,

44
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,839
the vast universe,

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,319
the solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy,
and the extragalactic star systems,

46
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,519
they can all make me

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,599
feel how tiny I am

48
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,559
and how mysterious the universe is.

49
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,480
So, you like adventures?

50
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,360
I do.

51
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,440
However, Weiyi, if you wish

52
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,279
for me to keep you company
at home every day,

53
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:46,519
I will obey your wish.

54
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,319
Bai Zeliu,

55
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,800
since you want to see the universe,

56
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,720
I'll prepare one for you.

57
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,279
Bai Zeliu,

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,880
I have a gift for you.

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,839
For real?

60
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,720
Follow me.

61
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,320
What's with the blackout?

62
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,440
Wait for me here.

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,279
I'll go and check it.

64
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:32,119
No need for that.

65
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,600
Now is the perfect time.

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,440
You can hold my hand
when I go downstairs later.

67
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,679
You're being so mysterious.

68
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,119
I'm looking forward to it.

69
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,399
Careful.

70
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,759
So, Weiyi, you brought me here

71
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,960
to enjoy the moon and the stars.

72
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,960
Bai Zeliu,

73
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,440
I can't afford to book
an interplanetary trip for you.

74
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
But I prepared one for you personally.

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I hope you like it.
