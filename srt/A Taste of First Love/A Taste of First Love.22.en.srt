3
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,239
Weiyi, are you hungry?

4
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,000
No.

5
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,040
Shall I send you home?

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,920
No, thanks.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,319
I like to take the bus.

8
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,520
I'll keep you company then.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,319
Where is he?

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,119
He gave up just like that?

11
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:48,350
(Please forgive me)

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,839
Bai Zeliu,

13
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,559
are you out of your mind?

14
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,600
Weiyi, have you forgiven me?

16
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,440
Let's have luosifen together.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
Weiyi, I know beautiful girls
like luosifen,

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,600
but I didn't expect you to like it too.

19
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,399
If you love me, you have to
eat it together with me.

20
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,559
I'll do it!

21
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,279
Mr. Bai,

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,039
my ideal home

23
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,600
has to have the smell of luosifen.

24
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,440
What do you think?

25
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,720
You have great taste.

26
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,759
I love it.

27
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,119
Bai Zeliu,

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,119
I know you provided for my father

29
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,479
for my sake.

30
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,119
However, you don't understand my family.

31
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,279
Once you are targeted by him,

32
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,080
he'll demand money from you constantly.

33
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,639
If so, I can try to understand
your family starting from now.

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
Honesty is the most important element

35
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,000
in a relationship.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,559
Weiyi,

37
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,839
I hope you won't need to
worry about anything

38
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,479
when you're with me.

39
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,960
How much did you spend on them?

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,199
Not much. It's quite cheap.

41
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,279
That's great.

42
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,639
Excuse me.
Which of you is Miss Sun Weiyi?

43
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,279
I am.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,399
This bouquet was sent by Mr. Bai Zeliu.

45
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,080
Thank you.

46
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,199
What flowers are these?

47
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,720
They look like cotton flowers.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
His net worth is over 100 million

49
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,679
yet he's so stingy.

50
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,880
These aren't ordinary flowers.

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,520
These are preserved flowers.

52
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,119
They can maintain this state forever,

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,000
which represents eternal bliss.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
Miss Sun, Mr. Bai said

55
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,720
that we have to send them
to your office every day

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,520
if you like them.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Bai Zeliu,

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,640
stop sending me gifts in public

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,679
in the future.

60
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,079
But why?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,320
I want everyone to know

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,880
that you are my girlfriend.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,799
But

64
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,440
Q is a blabbermouth.

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,760
If she knows,

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,119
the entire company will know about it.

67
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,480
They constantly ask me
to treat them to meals.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,839
It's not like your money
simply appears in your pocket.

69
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,920
Weiyi, are you concerned about me now?

70
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,200
Judging from your tone,

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,959
you'll be a stern wife.

72
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't worry.

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,519
Once we get married,

74
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,480
you'll be in charge of all my money.

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,040
Who are you calling your wife?

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Mrs. Bai.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Alright. Alright.

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,359
Who are you calling your wife?

79
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,720
You're not my wife. You're Mrs. Bai.

80
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not either!

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,839
Hey, daughter of the chairman
of the adulterated food company,

82
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,480
are you trying to harm people again?

83
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,920
We had been consuming
your products since young!

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,079
We never expected your father
to be such a sly man!

85
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,160
He's inhumane!

86
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,359
Do you know

87
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,880
how many children had consumed
your adulterated food products?

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,920
Some of them
have been suffering from malnutrition,

89
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,040
even disabilities!

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,679
And you?

91
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,839
You're squandering

92
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,679
our hard-earned money

93
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,640
to lead a wealthy life.

94
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,399
You must be enjoying yourself, huh?

95
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,160
Exactly!

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,640
Shameless wretch!
