Zeliu,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,560
are you free tonight?

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,399
I miss you.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,800
Weiyi, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,399
I'm busy tonight.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,760
Fine then.

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,280
Weiyi, you can ask Q

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,360
to keep you company first.

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,799
I will have Dai reimburse your expense.

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,280
Okay.

13
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,159
Q,

14
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:33,080
my boyfriend stood me up.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,720
Are you free tonight?

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,959
Sorry, Weiyi.

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm meeting my new boyfriend tonight.

18
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,279
Tonight's our first date

19
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:41,360
so...

20
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,479
All right.

21
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,279
I got it.

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,479
But Weiyi,

23
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,080
does your boyfriend
stand you up often lately?

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,040
I think he did it several times.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,959
He said he was busy with work.

26
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,720
If so, you should be careful.

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,560
You see,

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,200
there's a saying lately.

29
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,639
"Who are you sleeping with

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,560
when I'm thinking about you
on the nights I can't sleep?"

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,639
That's impossible.

32
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,279
Everything is possible.

33
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,040
Anyway, if you encounter any issues,

34
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,680
you need to investigate them
and find out the truth.

35
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,599
Sun Weiyi,

36
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,199
you're truly something.

37
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:17,639
Not only did you seduce my brother,

38
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,559
but now, you also want him
to pay your whole family's expenses?

39
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:20,599
Bai Lingfei,

40
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,879
what do you mean by that?

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I'm dating your brother seriously.

42
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,959
You may look innocent,

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,839
but in reality, you're a femme fatale!

44
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,519
Bai Lingfei,

45
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:29,879
do not speak without any evidence.

46
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,160
What on earth do you mean?

47
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,400
You're still pretending?

48
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,000
If I didn't bump into Zeliu

49
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,040
when he was giving
your scheming father money today,

50
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,519
I would never know

51
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,080
that your father, a parasite,

52
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,319
had been leeching off Zeliu

53
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,839
ever since he came out of prison!

54
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,919
Look at you.

55
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,319
You seduced my brother

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,639
so he could provide money for you

57
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,680
and even support

58
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,639
your family for you.

59
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,040
You're shameless!

60
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,360
What did you say?

61
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,199
Mr. Bai,

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,919
I swear

63
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:00,160
this is definitely the last time.

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,080
Thank you...

65
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,639
Dad?

66
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,919
What are you doing?

67
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,720
Weiyi,

68
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,800
what are you doing here?

69
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,440
Great timing.

70
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Today

71
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,679
can be considered our family reunion.

72
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,960
Bai Zeliu,

73
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,639
have you been providing for him
all along?

74
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,880
Weiyi,

75
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
how could you put it
in such an ugly way?

76
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,160
Dai,

77
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,240
see Mr. Sun off first.

78
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,600
Okay.

79
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,199
Weiyi, how could you?

80
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,919
Please follow me.

81
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,639
Mr. Bai!

82
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Over here.

83
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,399
Bai Zeliu,

84
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,639
why didn't you

85
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,800
tell me about it?

86
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,479
Miss Sun,

87
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,759
your father took out a loan
from loan sharks

88
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,559
not long ago.

89
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:41,759
The loan sharks were after him.

90
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,679
Our boss saved him back then.

91
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,479
Not only did our boss
repay his loan for him,

92
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,639
but he also gave him living expenses.

93
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,520
However, your father

94
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,279
would come to the company
to ask for more money from time to time.

95
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,279
If he didn't get any money,

96
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,279
he would stir up trouble
in your workplace

97
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,440
to affect your work.

98
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,039
I just didn't want him
to affect your life.

99
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
He did everything for the sake of money.

100
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,199
You can just ignore him.

101
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,160
And, this is my family affair.

102
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
It's none of your business.

103
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,759
None of my business?

104
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,119
In my heart,

105
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,919
your business is my business.

106
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,679
Weiyi,

107
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:14,919
are you still going to exclude me

108
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,679
from your life, just like you used to?

109
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,919
That's not what I mean.

110
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,720
That is what you mean.

111
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm sorry.

112
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,360
You knew that I didn't like it
when you said that.

113
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Regarding the money my father owes you,

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
ask Dai to draft up a list for me.

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,119
I'll repay it to you later.

116
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:37,679
Do we need to separate things so clearly

117
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,440
between you and me?

118
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,399
Yes.
