Today, a mysterious figure will come.

17

Who is it?

18
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,200
He's the chairman of HB E-Commerce.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,599
You mean the chairman
of the e-commerce company

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,680
that had taken over the industry?

21
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:56,680
I heard that he's a mysterious person.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,080
He doesn't reveal his face to anyone.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,759
He and I are especially close.

24

Come on.

Let's finish this drink.

Nice to meet you.

49

What a coincidence.

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,319
Our company is planning to expand

Sure.

Bai Zeliu,

62

you knew I'm allergic to peaches.

Yeah.

64
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,039
Of course, I know.

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,320
I just didn't expect you

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,240
to become a socializer.

I've especially ordered for you.

You'll stop itching after a few minutes.

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,639
However, I think you wouldn't even

73
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,080
give me a chance to see you

74
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
if I didn't do so.

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,080
I'm here for business today.

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
I will talk about nothing else

77
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
except for business.

00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,160
Mr. Bai,

79
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,000
please mind your behavior.

80
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,520
Fine.

81
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:05,800
If you wish to talk about business,

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,279
let's talk about business then.

83
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
Since you can drink with that fatty,

84
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,600
I can provide you

85
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,199
with way more benefits than him.

86
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,520
Mr. Qian and I are just
normal business partners.

87
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm not someone
who will sacrifice everything

88

for the sake of my career.

89
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,919
However, Weiyi, in my eyes,

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,880
you're someone

91
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,440
who'll sacrifice everything
for your relationship.

92
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,679
I'm sorry

93
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,759
for what I've done in the past.

94
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,160
Why are you being sorry?

95
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,600
Are you sorry because you kept

96
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,520
caring about me at my workplace

97
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,759
and said that it was
love at first sight?

98
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,320
Or was it because you admired me

99
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,800
because I'm a genius and that I would
make it big in the future?

100
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,160
Or was it because you let me experience

101
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,639
what love felt like when I was 18?

102
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,279
No matter what,

103
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,039
times have changed.

104
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,759
We should let bygones be bygones.

105
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
Let bygones be bygones?

106
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360
That's impossible.

107
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
Bai Zeliu,

108
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm sure you came back

109
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,119
out of the blue to humiliate me, right?

110
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,800
Are you happy

111
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,919
now that I'm in such a pathetic state?

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,520
Stop.

114

Everything is already over.

She had gone through a lot.

She only reached this position
last year.

that Miss Sun's boyfriend, Ren Mingyuan,

was a software developer.

129

to his rival company.

131
