1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,719
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,280
Did you see the shooter's face?

4
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,199
She probably created the situation

5
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,810
so she could be the hero
and impress me.

6
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,039
You might have
made enemies in the past.

7
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,120
I told you that
you can't fail this time.

8
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
- A hundred million.
- A hundred million.

9
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,000
Why is he so heavily in debt?

10
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,159
Pack it all up, and sell it.

11
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
These things are precious to me.

12
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,840
Don't you understand our situation?
Nothing is the same anymore.

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Book me for every day this week.

14
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,719
From seven to two. At any place.

15
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,319
Look at what you did to yourself.

16
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,080
You're lucky you are still alive.

17
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,199
I've entered all your giveaway
competitions, but I never won.

18
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,039
Please, let me have it.

19
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
He insists on giving you the company
when you clearly don't want it.

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Danai and I have worked so hard,
but we're only strangers to him.

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
You want the company, right?
You can have it.

22
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,840
Who is going to buy these?

23
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,719
Going live at 7 p.m. tonight.

24
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,439
Girls, get yourself ready.

25
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,599
Get the good stuff
before it's all gone.

26
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,120
So, have you calmed down yet?

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Not yet.

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
If not, stay here.
You can't see your son yet.

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,360
Gosh. You always protect him.

30
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,120
Should I be upset?

31
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
Are you upset?
I won't make it up to you.

32
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,800
You're an attention-seeker
just like your son.

33
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,039
What?

34
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,319
(VN Chairman has suffered a stroke)

35
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,800
- Dear, I have bad news.
- What is it?

36
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,360
What? Pethai.

37
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,050
This is so great.

38
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,199
Wow, your chest muscles.

39
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,120
Girls will scream.

40
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,639
I've dug into DJ Prao's background.

41
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,879
If you want to contact her,
you have to go through her manager.

42
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,319
She has hundreds of thousands
of followers.

43
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,279
She is pretty, smart, perfect,
exactly your type.

44
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,279
- Where did you meet her?
- Is it time for the event to start?

45
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
It is.

46
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,560
Welcome to
the new world of Mars Wiz.

47
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Our technology has been made
compatible with all platforms.

48
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,040
Today,

49
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,759
one lucky person

50
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,319
will get to try this game.

51
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,879
Yes!

52
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,840
What?

53
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,639
Whoa.

54
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,879
This is awesome.

55
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,240
Oh.

56
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,090
Besides virtual reality giving
players an immersive experience,

57
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,120
player avatars will be generated
according to each player's input,

58
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,759
making each avatar unique.

59
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,600
Anybody who wants to play
and experience this game,

60
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,679
you can try it for yourself.

61
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,000
Our staff will take care of you.

62
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,360
I hope you enjoy our game.

63
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,679
Someday I will make a game
as fun as Warut's games.

64
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,559
Got it?

65
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,519
- Good job.
- Thanks. Please try the game.

66
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,559
Great job, Boss.

67
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,480
I have some other business
to attend to.

68
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,039
What is it?
Why don't I know about this?

69
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,639
It's personal.

70
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,360
I see. A special appointment.

71
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,519
Hey.

72
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,679
Some things can only be appreciated
from a distance.

73
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,639
You will never get to have them.

74
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,840
Hm? What do you mean?

75
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,039
There.

76
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,840
The rule of being a good fan

77
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,039
is admiring your idol from afar and
following their work appropriately.

78
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,840
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You will only get hurt.

79
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm just a fan of your boss.
I'm not getting ahead of myself.

80
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,639
Really?

81
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
Good for you then.
It's just a friendly reminder.

82
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,240
Thank you so much
for coming to visit.

83
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,639
I'm here for you.

84
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,799
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to let us know.

85
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,960
Isn't that right, dear?

86
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
Let us know if you need anything.

87
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,679
We would be happy
to help you with anything.

88
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,360
Thank you.

89
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,240
But I still have it under control.

90
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,279
Then you must tell me first
if you need help. Promise me.

91
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,799
Okay.

92
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,919
Da, let me help.

93
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Where are Petch and Mook?

94
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,679
Well, Petch isn't home yet.

95
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,000
And Mook is busy.

96
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,799
- Busy?
- Yes.

97
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,279
What is she doing?

98
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

99
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,799
What's up?

100
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:14,360
Rut, find a way for me to
get in contact with DJ Prao.

101
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,600
Why's that?
Are you going to pursue her?

102
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,519
No. I just need to talk to her.

103
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,120
About what?

104
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,120
About the shooting.

105
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,720
And about the attack on me
at the hospital.

106
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,600
What? What happened?

107
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,679
This means in Korea
you were actually their target.

108
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
That's right.

109
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,559
The possible suspect is DJ Prao.

110
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,039
So find a way for me to
get in touch with her.

111
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,600
I think she and the shooter
are connected.

112
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,039
You got it.

113
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,240
There's only one of each item.

114
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,000
If you want it,
try to confirm the order quickly.

115
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,440
- So, what's it going to be?
- At this price, you can't miss it.

116
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,720
Confirm, DJ Prao.

117
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,359
Wait.

118
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,960
I have to talk to you.

119
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,079
No talking during the sale.

120
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,519
We need to talk now.

121
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,410
I need your answer.

122
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,890
If you don't talk to me,
I will keep sending you messages.

123
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,559
Talk to me now.

124
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,839
I'm going ruin your sale.
Do you want to try me?

125
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,119
Guys, it looks like this user
is trying to disturb me.

126
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,359
If you don't stop this behavior,

127
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,200
I would have to block you.

128
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,440
Why are you trying to disturb her?
Are you a psycho?

129
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,359
If you want our attention so much,
I will give it to you.

130
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,410
Go to sleep, brat.
Don't throw a tantrum here.

131
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,599
Block him.

132
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,319
Hey!

133
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,319
Okay, guys. The nuisance is gone.
Let's continue shopping.

134
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,519
You deserved it.

135
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,200
That punk DJ.

136
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,599
Don't think you can escape me.

137
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,079
Why are you so selfish?

138
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,359
I'm not selfish.

139
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,920
It's you who are being selfish.
You don't care about me at all.

140
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,119
These things are just like
your stupid DJ equipment.

141
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,440
That stupid DJ equipment
helps me make money.

142
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,200
I have to save this house
for when Dad comes back.

143
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,410
But if you think this house means
nothing to you, fine.

144
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,440
I understand.

145
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,440
But have you ever understood
Mom or me? Ask yourself that.

146
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,000
Dad.

147
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,960
I don't know what to do.

148
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,519
Please don't cancel
after confirmation.

149
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,039
See you next time. Bye-bye.

150
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,039
Done.

151
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,559
Are you okay?

152
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,039
Of course. I'm just a little tired.

153
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,799
How can you not be?
You'd talked for almost three hours.

154
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,319
Besides, Lan tried to ruin
your session.

155
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,680
I wonder what it was about
and how important it is.

156
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,039
I guess it's about
what happened in Korea.

157
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,000
If I'd known he'd be a nuisance,
I would have stayed away from him.

158
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,519
But you didn't.

159
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,650
I think he will try to find you.

160
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't care.

161
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
Are you sure
you don't care about him?

162
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,559
I don't care.

163
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,519
All I care about are my debts.

164
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,799
Why did you just get home?

165
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm tired of people.

166
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,200
What's in your hand?

167
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,000
Don't you understand that
we have to be careful with money?

168
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,279
You scold me without even asking.
That's why I don't want to be here.

169
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:30,000
I got this model for free.

170
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,640
Is there anything else
you want to ask?

171
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
There is.

172
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,319
- What is it?
- Did you have dinner?

173
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,279
I'll heat it up for you.

174
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,559
What are you looking at?

175
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm looking at that.

176
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,960
Ahh!

177
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,119
Petch!

178
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,119
Petch, get rid of it.

179
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,160
- Get rid of it.
- Why? He's cute. Look at him.

180
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,839
Ew, how is it cute?

181
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,799
Look at its eyes.
It's looking for where to bite me.

182
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,440
And it's going to bring its friends.

183
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,720
- Ah!
- Shoo!

184
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,119
- Shoo! Go away!
- Petch, are you even trying?

185
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,200
- Okay, I'll stop.
- Petch, please.

186
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,240
There.

187
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,799
I've got him.

188
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
No. Get it away from me.

189
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,759
- Look.
- No!

190
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
No! Get it away from me!

191
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
No!

192
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,839
Guys, we have a new member.
His name is M.

193
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,359
Please take care of him.

194
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,319
Rut, come here.

195
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,519
You want your dad to see it,
don't you?

196
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Dear, take a look at this.

197
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,039
Look at our son.

198
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,000
His wound hasn't fully healed
and he went out already.

199
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,440
My only son is undependable.

200
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,079
Dear, take it easy.

201
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,279
I have a feeling that
he's been having bad luck.

202
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,319
That's why he has been making
bad choices and getting sick.

203
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,319
Oh, come on.

204
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,759
He has brought this on himself.
It has nothing to do with luck.

205
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:11,400
It clearly has something
to do with luck. Think about it.

206
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,799
There was a crowd of people.
But why was it Lan who got shot?

207
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,400
If they really got the wrong guy,
it means it was bad luck.

208
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,359
Dear, if we don't do anything,

209
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,039
I'm afraid it could be
a matter of life or death.

210
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,480
Yes, you're right.

211
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,039
When it comes to horoscopes,

212
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
we have to consult him.

213
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,200
Thanks for coming.
I'll see you next time.

214
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,599
DJ Prao, a VIP guest
would like to talk to you.

215
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,119
Didn't the manager tell you that
I don't do side jobs

216
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,519
or meet with fans?

217
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,920
What if you were paid for it,
then would you talk to me?

218
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,759
I need to talk to DJ Prao.

219
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
I don't think she is connected
to the shooter.

220
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,400
Why would she attack
someone she just met?

221
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,359
I think you're just interested
in her and want to see her again.

222
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,519
And the more she rejects you,
the more you want her. Am I right?

223
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,759
No.

224
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,839
I just want to know how
she managed to save me in time.

225
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,920
It was a coincidence.
She just happened to be close by.

226
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,759
She helped you out of humanity.

227
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,799
It's too much of a coincidence.

228
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,599
And you're being too biased.

229
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,240
Hey, you should be on my side.

230
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,279
Between you and a girl,

231
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,480
I would choose a girl over you.

232
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,119
Poom sent me her schedule.

233
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,480
You just decide
where you want to meet her.

234
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,240
But I don't think
she will give you a straight answer.

235
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,799
I have an idea.

236
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:26,079
I'm going to get her drunk
and get the truth out of her.

237
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,240
You just keep a lookout.

238
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,359
Let me know
if anything seems suspicious.

239
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,240
I'll give you 2,000 baht a shot.

240
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:39,359
And if you can finish them all,
I'll triple the price.

241
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,359
Consider it compensation
for your time.

242
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,680
This will be our last talk.

243
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,079
I'll answer all your questions.

244
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,400
Then we'll go our separate ways.

245
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
It's a deal.

246
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,880
But we'll drink and talk, okay?

247
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,480
Drinks only.

248
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,400
No touching. No visiting other
places. I only accept cash.

249
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,039
Okay.

250
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
This is my friend, Rut.

251
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
He will keep an eye on you.

252
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,559
If you cheat,
I'll make you regret it.

253
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,359
Wait.

254
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Where are you going?

255
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,160
- We haven't had our talk.
- Time's up.

256
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,880
Are you trying to trick me?

257
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,480
I don't trick people.

258
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,519
But you're trying to go over
the agreed time limit.

259
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,359
You can't leave yet.

260
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
I told you. Time is up.

261
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,640
You wasted it.

262
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,519
I'll give you 20,000.

263
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,759
Twenty thousand.

264
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,279
Will you accept it?

265
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Sure.

266
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,920
So you can be bought with money.

267
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,559
If there's money, you have time.

268
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,240
Talking to you is a waste of time.

269
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,519
To me, time is money.

270
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,440
I guess a timewaster like you
wouldn't understand.

271
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,400
- Hey!
- Go on. You have two minutes.

272
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,279
I want to know who shot me.

273
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,680
I don't know.

274
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,200
I don't believe you.

275
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,880
You saved me just in time.
It's too much of a coincidence.

276
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,480
Not a coincidence, more like
some seriously bad luck.

277
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,640
I almost got shot and now you're
accusing me of being involved.

278
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,319
I should have let them shoot you,
so this would be over.

279
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
How can I trust you?

280
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,839
How can I be sure
that you're telling the truth?

281
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,839
If I was involved,
it'd be stupid of me to tell you.

282
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,240
I'll say it one last time.
I don't know anything.

283
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,240
Instead of finding fault with me,
why don't you try to figure out

284
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,799
if you have wronged someone?

285
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,799
And if you can't figure it out,
go to the police.

286
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,400
I will.

287
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,000
This one has some serious adversity
ahead of him.

288
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,809
His enemy is looking for
a chance to ruin him.

289
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,039
They want him dead.

290
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,239
You must quickly find a way
to ward off his bad luck.

291
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,000
- Is it a matter of life or death?
- Yes, it is.

292
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,599
This one is easily led astray
by evil desires.

293
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,119
His life will go down.
Like a living hell.

294
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,599
Worst case, he could lose his life.

295
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,809
- Is there a way to fix this?
- There is.

296
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,769
- Hey!
- Fortunately,

297
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,000
a woman born on the 15th day
of the 4th waxing moon

298
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,360
will protect him from adversity.

299
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,880
Where is the enemy?

300
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,559
Building A, wrong angle.

301
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,960
Building B,
the shooting angle is too narrow.

302
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,480
Building A, 6th Floor,
the roof provides high visibility.

303
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,360
I know I look snuggly. But you don't
have to hold me so tightly.

304
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,239
Or maybe you don't want this
to be over?

305
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,440
Do you want to go
somewhere else with me?

306
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:03,480
I don't want to hold you.

307
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,809
I will try to believe that.

308
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,079
You always bring me bad luck.

309
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,239
Seriously, do you have
an enemy who wants you dead?

310
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,360
- Why are you asking me that?
- In case you can think of someone

311
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,199
and finally stop thinking
that I am involved.

312
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,400
You're done, right? I'll go home.

313
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,519
Hey, wait.

314
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
What is it?

315
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,639
Your hand.

316
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,519
Lan, wait up.

317
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:48,400
Wait up. Don't go yet.

318
00:36:58,809 --> 00:36:59,960
You're so careless.

319
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,679
Don't touch me.

320
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,920
It's my hand. I can take care of it.

321
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Whatever.

322
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,289
Live carefully.

323
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:40,000
Don't look for a fight with people
like you did with me.

324
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,920
I'm telling you this
for your own sake.

325
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,289
From where they were standing,
they could've shot him.

326
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,329
They wanted to kill him.

327
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,039
Based on the trajectory,

328
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,880
the shooter should be there.

329
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,519
Cigarette ash.
But no butt can be found.

330
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,119
They're careful, a professional.

331
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:56,960
The shooter was waiting
for him here, smoking.

332
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,400
What? Did you tell him you saw
someone about to shoot him?

333
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,960
I didn't tell him.

334
00:39:22,289 --> 00:39:25,289
If I did, he would think
I was involved.

335
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,289
Besides, I'm not sure of what I saw.

336
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,480
I had too much to drink,
so I was a little dizzy.

337
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,039
I think you should tell him.

338
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,559
Based on the way he kept
bothering me, I think he knows.

339
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,599
Well, you're right.

340
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:58,769
Lan.

341
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:01,559
What is it?

342
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:03,840
Be more careful for the time being.

343
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:07,199
If you want to go somewhere,
tell me and I will go with you.

344
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,039
Why?

345
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,559
Is there something I should know?

346
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Did you just get back?

347
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,519
What are you talking about?
It looks serious.

348
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
It's nothing.

349
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,000
Where did you go?
Why are you home so late?

350
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,639
My meeting ran late.

351
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:48,480
You work so hard. Dad shouldn't
make me take your place.

352
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,599
A son

353
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:53,289
is better than a son-in-law.

354
00:40:57,769 --> 00:40:58,960
I should go home.

355
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:01,639
Alright.

356
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,440
Excuse me.

357
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:10,360
Let's get inside.

358
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,159
No, no, no.

359
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,960
His life is none of your business.

360
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,159
- Here is your water.
- Thanks.

361
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:41,809
- Here is your water.
- Thanks.

362
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,039
Da, I've had a bad feeling
since I entered your house.

363
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:52,000
I saw a court order
attached to your front gate.

364
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,920
Let me say something.

365
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,329
How about this?

366
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,440
You can borrow my money
to clear your debts.

367
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,840
You don't have to pay any interest.

368
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,639
And you can pay me back
whenever you're ready.

369
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:13,519
We want you and your kids
to stay in this house.

370
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,519
Please.

371
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,239
Hi, Uncle and Auntie.

372
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,679
It's me, Mook.

373
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,480
Oh.

374
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,239
I see.

375
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,840
Mook, you've become so pretty
that I didn't recognize you.

376
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,480
Thank you.

377
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,679
About the house,
I have to refuse your offer.

378
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,920
Mook, why is that?

379
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,719
I think this is better for everyone.

380
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:13,360
No, it's not.

381
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,199
Fifty million is a lot of money.

382
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,320
If you use that money to invest,
it will give you millions in return.

383
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,480
It'll be disadvantageous for you
to let us borrow freely.

384
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,239
Pretty. Smart.

385
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,440
Wise. Forward-looking.

386
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:36,719
Who said it'll be
disadvantageous for us?

387
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,800
In this investment,
I have an offer for you.

388
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,440
What is it?

389
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,440
Marry Lan again.

390
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,039
A woman born on this day
will overpower his enemy.

391
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:04,639
She will rid Chalantorn
of all evil desires.

392
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,000
It will be best
if he marries the same girl.

393
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,480
This time,
let them be husband and wife.

394
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,239
Chalantorn will overcome
this adversity.

395
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,239
His life will prosper.
He will have a happy family.

396
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,320
Your business will flourish.

397
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:22,360
Remember this.

398
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,039
If you want your son to prosper,
he has to marry the same girl.

399
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:29,599
The same girl.

400
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,639
And did he agree to this?

401
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,159
Sure.

402
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,960
I've talked to him.
He's okay with it.

403
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,119
Marrying the duckling?

404
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,920
That's right. You have
serious adversity ahead of you.

405
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,360
She can help you.

406
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,960
I mean, look at this.

407
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,599
Even her picture
can help you recover.

408
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,280
If you marry her,
she will help you get through it.

409
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,920
- I'm not marrying her.
- What?

410
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,960
Isn't her family heavily in debt
and almost bankrupt?

411
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,559
She can't even help herself.

412
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:09,880
How can she help Lan
when they're married?

413
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:12,480
It would be a waste of our money.

414
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,920
I don't agree with this.

415
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,840
But she can make him better.

416
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,960
Whatever. You're going to
marry her no matter what.

417
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,639
I will not marry her.

418
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,599
I don't care if
it's a matter of life or death.

419
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,559
I can get through it on my own.

420
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,920
Repeat. I will not marry her.

421
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,000
I have to refuse your offer.

422
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,639
Both the house and marriage.

423
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,119
If my dad finds out
that you helped us,

424
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,840
he would feel guilty about it.

425
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,039
Besides, Mom and I want to
get through this ourselves first.

426
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,440
I agree with Mook.

427
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,280
Let us find our way
out of this first.

428
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,039
Of course, Da.

429
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,639
But if you think you can't do it,

430
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,119
you can let me know.

431
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
Okay.

432
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,360
If you marry her,
she will help you get through it.

433
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,719
You're going to
marry her no matter what.

434
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,800
I will not marry you, duckling.

435
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,159
- This one is very cheap.
- Nice.

436
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,880
- It's only 250 baht.
- Only 250 baht.

437
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,760
Here I come.

438
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,320
There you go.

439
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,039
Petch.

440
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,039
- Petch.
- Come on.

441
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Petch.

442
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,719
Wake up.

443
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,760
Petch, wake up.

444
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,280
Why are you waking me up so early?

445
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,079
Go and help Mom make cookies.

446
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,960
No.

447
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,840
Get up.

448
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:42,880
You won't get your allowance
if you don't work.

449
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:45,960
Come on, Mook.
Why do you have to bring up money?

450
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:48,000
Besides, why are you forcing me?

451
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,400
Mom already has Ting.
Why would she need my help?

452
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,599
That's right.

453
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,079
Ting isn't family
and she still helps Mom.

454
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,960
So why don't you help her
instead of being a dead weight?

455
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,039
Right. I'm a dead weight.

456
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:03,639
I can't do anything.

457
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,840
I'm only good at asking for money.

458
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:10,280
Honestly, would helping Mom work
make me 100 million?

459
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,880
It's still better than doing nothing

460
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,480
and sleeping all day
without a care in the world.

461
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,840
This is more shameful.

462
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,480
What do you want me to do?

463
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,960
Dad suddenly ended up in the ICU.

464
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,119
And we're about to have
no roof over our heads.

465
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:24,920
Our lives changed overnight.

466
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,760
I'm not like you
who can do anything.

467
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,199
If I'm such a dead weight to you,

468
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,400
you can just let me starve to death.

469
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:40,519
- Mook, your mom fainted.
- Da!

470
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:42,920
- Hang in there.
- Mom!

471
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,400
- Mom!
- Da!

472
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,280
- Mom!
- Da!

473
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,119
- Mook!
- Da!

474
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
Mom!

475
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,719
Mom! Oak, what happened to her?

476
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,199
I don't know. She just fell down.

477
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,760
Mom.

478
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,159
What should we do?

479
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:03,360
- Mom.
- Mom.

480
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,239
Oh, Da.

481
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,360
Mom.

482
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:08,719
- Mom.
- Da.

483
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,960
- Mom.
- Da.

484
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:12,239
Get up slowly.

485
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,119
- Da.
- Mom.

486
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,760
Are you okay, Mom?

487
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:21,880
Mom.

488
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,840
Drink some water.

489
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,280
- This is your medicine.
- Ting, let me.

490
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Da.

491
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,159
A menthol inhaler.

492
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,480
Do you want to see a doctor?

493
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,519
I'm fine, Mook.

494
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,760
I'm just a little tired.
I just need to rest for a bit.

495
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
It's because
you haven't had enough rest.

496
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,119
You take care of Pethai
at the hospital.

497
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:56,440
When you get back, you make cookies.

498
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,599
- And when you're done, it's late.
- Ting.

499
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,440
Mom, I can't let you overwork
and pass out again.

500
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,400
You have to take care of yourself.

501
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,800
If something happens to you too,
I don't know if I can go on.

502
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,519
I promise you.
I will take care of myself.

503
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,360
Don't worry about me.

504
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,159
Let me give you a massage.

505
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,840
You'll get your strength back

506
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:40,480
and stay strong.

507
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,440
You can enter.

508
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,559
Dad.

509
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,079
Don't worry about Mom and Petch.

510
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,000
I will do my best
to take care of them.

511
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,960
When you wake up,

512
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,000
we'll be together once again.

513
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,159
Here is the first medical bill.

514
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,440
Hold on a second.

515
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,960
Your credit card has been declined.
Please contact your bank.

516
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
Alright.

517
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,559
- I will pay you in cash.
- Okay.

518
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:52,119
(Lawyer)

519
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:04,920
Hello.

520
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,119
About compounding your debt,
the bank agreed to do it.

521
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,599
But you have to pay the outstanding
amount and the handling fee.

522
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:19,480
Then I will submit
the documents to the court.

523
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,239
(Debt Compromise Agreement)

524
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:43,199
Mom!

525
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,559
Dad suddenly ended up in the ICU.

526
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,840
And we're about to have
no roof over our heads.

527
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,320
Our lives changed overnight.

528
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,800
I want you to help me out with
the company as soon as possible.

529
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,760
Dad.

530
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:59,960
I'm sorry for coming back too late.

531
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,920
Prao, you must keep going.

532
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,239
You must protect your family
and save your house.

533
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,719
Thank you. See you next time.

534
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
Let go.

535
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,719
Hey!

536
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Hey.

537
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,119
Hey, let go of me.

538
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,480
What do you think you're doing?

539
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,320
What do you think I'm doing?

540
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,079
Would you do it?

541
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,960
Pervert, are you trying
to touch me? Get lost.

542
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,159
You're good at throwing insults.

543
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,719
I'm also good at other things.

544
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,599
Using an old trick,
you're not that good.

545
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:09,119
Let me go, or I'll scream.

546
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,360
I have a question for you.

547
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:13,559
What is it?

548
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,159
You're Praomook.

549
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,920
Praomook.

550
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:45,800
DJ Prao.

551
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,119
Uncle Pethai.

552
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,519
When we first met,
I thought you looked familiar.

553
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,880
It really is you.

554
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,599
Have we met before?

555
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,599
Why didn't you tell me
you're Praomook?

556
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,800
Why should I? It's a waste of time.

557
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,000
We don't have anything to do
with each other anymore.

558
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Really?

559
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,880
I think it was your plan.

560
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,639
You showed up
and tried to get my intention.

561
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,000
You set up the shooting so
you could be a hero and impress me.

562
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,679
You played hard to get
to make me want you.

563
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,400
And you brainwashed my parents
into arranging our marriage,

564
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,199
when in fact you want the money
to pay off your debts.

565
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,880
You're willing to sleep with people
to make money.

566
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:06,920
It's been your plan all long.

567
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:09,440
I would never come up
with such a crazy idea.

568
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,760
Are you still denying it
after all of that?

569
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:15,400
Don't think people
can't keep up with your game.

570
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,840
I don't care that you're pretty.
I will not marry you.

571
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,199
Being near you makes my skin crawl.

572
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,440
Because your mind is filthy.

573
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,119
I don't want to marry you either.

574
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,480
I don't believe you. You play
hard to get to boost your value.

575
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,039
Do you think you can
use yourself to clear your debts?

576
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:37,079
If I were to give you an estimate,

577
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,159
you should be worth a few thousand.

578
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,400
The more you try
to make yourself valuable,

579
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:46,719
the cheaper you look in my eyes.

580
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,320
Your mind is filthier than mine.

581
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,559
You're right.
It was my plan all along.

582
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,119
I need money to pay off my debts.

583
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,559
So I hired a gunman
to follow your every move.

584
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,119
I wanted to impress you
and make you fall for me.

585
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,199
And I succeeded.

586
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:11,519
You took an interest in me.
You wanted me.

587
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,679
With men, tease them a little

588
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,079
make them feel challenged,

589
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,119
and they will fall
right into your trap.

590
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,880
You're disgusting.

591
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:28,280
How much do I disgust you?

592
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:29,719
Very.

593
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:32,159
Alright.

594
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,800
If I disgust you so much,

595
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,360
I will marry you.

596
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:46,559
We will not get married.

597
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,639
But your parents want us
to get married.

598
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,119
I should tell them tomorrow
that I want to marry you.

599
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:57,920
You can't run away from me.

600
01:02:58,039 --> 01:02:59,360
I will not run away.

601
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:01,519
Instead, I will make you
get out of my life.

602
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:04,599
The more you want me
out of your life,

603
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:08,599
the more I want to marry you.

604
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,079
I hate you.

605
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,519
Remember what you just said.

606
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,639
Because I will make you love me.

607
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,519
I will never love you.

608
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,880
Make sure you don't end up
eating your own words.

609
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,599
I won't.

610
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,960
Oh, I see.

611
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,639
Are you doing this

612
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,079
because you still love me?

613
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,840
You want me, don't you?

614
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:54,159
Alright.

615
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,239
I will lower myself
and spend a night with you.

616
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,880
I will make you so happy that you'll
forget about your exes.

617
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,199
And when tomorrow comes,

618
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,280
everything between us will be over
and you will get out of my life.

619
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,519
Okay?

620
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,039
Hey, are you crazy?
You could've bitten off my ear.

621
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,559
I wouldn't give a permanent reward
for something temporary.

622
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,320
I will beat a narcissist like you.

623
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,920
I will be in your life,

624
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,039
making you fall for me.

625
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,280
Get ready to marry me.

626
01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:12,039
You're disgusting.

627
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:14,719
I hate you.

628
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,960
Come to the cafe at 7 p.m. From Lan.

629
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,639
This song

630
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,440
represents my feelings for you.

631
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:27,800
I love you, Nuch.

632
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,079
Only you.

633
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:34,320
Trust me.

634
01:06:39,639 --> 01:06:41,639
Don't you love Praomook?

635
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:45,320
I saw her confess her feelings
for you at the soccer field.

636
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,679
She shares a bond with you,
and I can't beat that.

637
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,559
I came after her. I know that.

638
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,280
She loves me,

639
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,840
but I don't love her.

640
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,039
I will never love
that ugly duckling.

641
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,719
She doesn't deserve me.

642
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,119
You're mean.

643
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,239
If she heard that,
she would be upset.

644
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,199
She is awfully ugly.

645
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,039
Now she suffers unrequited love.

646
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,920
You're way out of her league.

647
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:22,159
I feel sorry for her.

648
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,639
For someone with a pretty face,
you have a very foul mouth.

649
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,920
You should wash your mouth
before you speak.

650
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:41,039
Mook!

651
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,159
How dare you! You ugly girl!

652
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,800
Go ahead. Show everyone here

653
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,320
that you're only pretty
on the outside.

654
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,840
Look at you.
You're not so different from me now.

655
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:54,679
Are you crazy, Praomook?

656
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,039
I can get crazier.
Do you want to try me?

657
01:07:57,559 --> 01:07:58,880
You too. Want to try me?

658
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,719
Lan, if you still hang around
this rude and ugly girl,

659
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,599
don't bother coming to see me again.

660
01:08:07,239 --> 01:08:08,480
We're over.

661
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,719
Nuch, wait!

662
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,360
You can't leave yet.
We have to talk.

663
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:16,529
What do you want?

664
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:20,039
You made me come here
to see that, didn't you?

665
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,880
That's right.

666
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,239
It's to make you realize

667
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,319
that I don't love you.

668
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,720
I never have

669
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,359
and never will.

670
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,479
That's not true. You love me.

671
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:32,960
I've done everything for you.

672
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:35,800
You must love me.
You can't love anybody else.

673
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,199
Stop talking nonsense.

674
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,760
Keep this in mind.
I find you annoying.

675
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,159
If I had to get sick or die
instead of having you in my life,

676
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,279
I'd rather die

677
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,800
than have you ruin my life.

678
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,569
Fine. If you think others
are better than me, you can go.

679
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:01,439
I won't bother you again.

680
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,609
I will stay out of your life
forever.

681
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,569
Even if you don't
get out of my life,

682
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,840
I will stay away from you myself.

683
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:09,960
I don't want

684
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:11,960
a disgusting person like you.

685
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,609
I will make you love me so much

686
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,199
that you can't live without me.

687
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,079
And I will leave you
just like you left me.

688
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,039
I will hurt you just like
you hurt me.

689
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:46,569
Gosh. Is she a dog?

690
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:51,840
Evil duckling,

691
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,079
I'd rather die than marry you.

692
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,880
You...

693
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,119
Yes, it's me.

694
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,000
How did you get here?

695
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:38,609
I'm here because you miss me.

696
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,359
I don't miss you.

697
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:50,039
You're lying. You miss me so much.

698
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,800
And I miss you so much

699
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,319
that I can't hold myself back.

700
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:29,800
It's your choice.

701
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:32,680
Don't regret it later.

702
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:46,569
You have to marry me.

703
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:00,279
Was that a dream?

704
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,920
Hey!

705
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,359
You can't think of her that way.

706
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,800
Lan.

707
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:27,720
Lan, are you awake?

708
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,479
Mom, why are you here?

709
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:32,000
Well, I'm here to wake you up.

710
01:13:32,119 --> 01:13:35,119
Listen, you have a guest
waiting for you downstairs.

711
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:36,569
Go get dressed.

712
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,720
Who is it?

713
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:40,720
I can't tell you.

714
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,000
It won't be a surprise
if I tell you.

715
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,439
You have to look handsome today.
Now, go take a shower.

716
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,000
No, Mom.

717
01:13:49,569 --> 01:13:51,239
Come on, Lan.

718
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,279
I told you to take a shower. Go.

719
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:56,399
No, Mom. I will do it myself.

720
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:57,649
You can leave.

721
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,199
Alright, I'll give you ten minutes.

722
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:06,479
If you're not done,
I will come back for you. Okay?

723
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,399
Okay, Mom. Start the clock.

724
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:12,439
And leave.

725
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,920
Lan, you have to look extra handsome

726
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:20,039
because you have
a special guest today. Got it?

727
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,279
No, Mom.

728
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:26,840
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so self-conscious?

729
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,359
Strange.

730
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,800
Alright.

731
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,960
Do as I say. Ten minutes.

732
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:35,529
Get it done.

733
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,760
If you don't, I will come back.

734
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,920
Okay, just leave.

735
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,359
Come on. Get up already.

736
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,920
Come on, Lan.

737
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,880
You can think about any woman

738
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:58,609
except the duckling.

739
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:01,199
Okay?

740
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:03,119
Okay?

741
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,199
Lan, go down.

742
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:22,800
Oh, Lan.

743
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,399
Wow. Models everywhere.

744
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:49,319
Alien Queen, Diorama.

745
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:51,319
Beautiful.

746
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,199
Darth Maul.

747
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,239
Cool.

748
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,239
Iron Man Mark VII.

749
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:08,359
Wow. I need pictures.

750
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,680
Alright, smile.

751
01:17:16,609 --> 01:17:18,199
Let's take a picture together.

752
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,000
So cute.

753
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,800
Medusa! Oh wow.

754
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,159
I won't look into your eyes.

755
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,760
I don't want to turn to stone.

756
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:38,609
Peekaboo!

757
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:40,609
It's that girl.

758
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,319
So beautiful.

759
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:44,529
Let me take a picture of you.

760
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,079
Smile.

761
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:53,079
Listen, if I can touch you,
I'll feel like the luckiest girl.

762
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:55,840
May I have your permission?

763
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:06,279
Hey.

764
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:11,609
Rut.

765
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,479
Woah, muscle.

766
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:24,479
Be careful.

767
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,920
This model doesn't have parts.
If it's damaged, it's gone.

768
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,800
Sorry.

769
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:33,529
I was too excited
to see such a rare model.

770
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,079
What are you doing here anyway?

771
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:40,680
Oh, I want to see you.

772
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,479
What's your business with me?

773
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:46,079
I want to return you something.
Hold on.

774
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,119
I put it here, didn't I?

775
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,199
Wait, where is it?

776
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:01,960
Hurry up. I have a meeting.

777
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,439
It's gone.

778
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:16,880
What's gone? Tell me.
I'll help you search for it.

779
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:18,199
It's a button.

780
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:19,319
What?

781
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:21,199
A button?

782
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,319
It's your button. I found it
and wanted to return it to you.

783
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,569
Forget it.

784
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,800
I can't. I found it.
I have to give it back.

785
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:32,359
Whatever.

786
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:33,840
But I have a meeting to attend.

787
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,319
If you find it, give it to
one of my employees.

788
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:40,529
Where is it?

789
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,199
Medusa statue.
Distance to the girl: 20cm.

790
01:19:53,319 --> 01:19:56,529
There's an 89 percent chance her
carelessness will cause an impact.

791
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,960
Hey, where are you taking me?

792
01:20:08,649 --> 01:20:10,920
Sit here and don't go anywhere.

793
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,760
Don't touch any of my models.

794
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,039
If you want to look for that button,
you're free to do so.

795
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:17,000
If you find it, give it to
one of my employees.

796
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:22,119
If you cause trouble, I will remove
you from the building. Got it?

797
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,079
You're cool.

798
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,920
Ouch! What are you doing?

799
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,079
You spaced out.
I asked you if you understood.

800
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:37,649
Understood.
You don't have to be mean.

801
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:41,239
Good. I'll go then.

802
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,880
Is she okay?

803
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:11,800
Lan, there you are.

804
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,159
Come with me. You don't want to
make our guest wait.

805
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:16,239
- Wait, Mom.
- What is it?

806
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:18,840
Can you tell me now
who this guest is?

807
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,840
You'll know when you see her.
Let's go.

808
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,119
Come on.

809
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:28,880
Lan is here.

810
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:43,720
Lan, do you remember her?

811
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,399
You look shocked.
You don't remember her, do you?

812
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:52,079
It's Mook. She's gotten
so much prettier.

813
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:53,609
Do you remember her?

814
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,569
Mook, this is Lan.
Do you remember him?

815
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:01,649
I wouldn't recognize him
if we meet outside.

816
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,880
Right, Lan?

817
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:06,800
I don't remember her

818
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:08,720
because I don't want to.

819
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:12,359
Wait. Lan,
why are you talking like that?

820
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:15,119
Have some manners, son.

821
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:18,439
With some people,
I don't need manners.

822
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,800
Why are you here?

823
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:24,760
Why do you think I am here?

824
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,800
Mook,

825
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,720
can you deliver this
to Auntie Pat's place?

826
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:45,239
Let's call a courier.
I don't want to go there.

827
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:47,479
But I want you to deliver it.

828
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,960
That way, you can thank them
for helping our business.

829
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,439
Do it for me.

830
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:00,960
If you don't want to go,
I can do it myself.

831
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,119
Alright.

832
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:10,399
If I do it, you have to rest.

833
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:12,439
Okay.

834
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,359
Maybe it's better that
I make the delivery.

835
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:22,239
I've been looking forward
to seeing someone.

836
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:25,960
Uncle, Auntie.

837
01:23:30,529 --> 01:23:34,479
I came here today because
I've got something to tell you.

838
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,800
- Oh, go ahead and tell us.
- What is it?

839
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:39,479
Praomook.

840
01:23:48,569 --> 01:23:50,199
I want to say

841
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,119
thank you for supporting
my mother's business.

842
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:05,319
It's fine, Mook.
You're very welcome.

843
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:08,159
Your mother's cookies are delicious.

844
01:24:08,279 --> 01:24:10,319
I'll definitely buy them again.

845
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,079
Thank you.

846
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:22,680
There's one more thing
I want to tell you.

847
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:32,920
I will marry Lan.

848
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:46,319
Mook, you're not joking, right?
I don't want to get my hopes up.

849
01:24:46,569 --> 01:24:48,359
Thank you so much, Mook.

850
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:51,399
I don't know who else can help him.

851
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,399
I'm glad I can help him.

852
01:24:53,649 --> 01:24:56,529
If my luck can keep him safe
and make his life better,

853
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,319
I'll gladly marry him.

854
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,159
I really care about him
and I want to help.

855
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:03,159
Wow.

856
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:07,319
He is so lucky
to have you as his bride

857
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,569
even though he is useless,

858
01:25:10,609 --> 01:25:12,039
has no future,

859
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,720
and does nothing with his life.

860
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,880
Anyway, please try to
be patient with him.

861
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,760
I will not marry her.

862
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,079
Lan, you have to.

863
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,840
If you don't marry her,
your life will be in serious danger.

864
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,479
Do you honestly want to die?

865
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,000
Mook is trying to help you.

866
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:38,359
If she wants to help,
she should stay out of it.

867
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:43,529
I don't think a marriage based on
superstition will save my life.

868
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,569
What year are we in?

869
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:48,319
Everything is up to our actions.
It has nothing to do with fate.

870
01:25:48,439 --> 01:25:50,569
Think of it as
you're doing this for them.

871
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:54,529
I really want to help you.

872
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:56,800
Why are you
disregarding my concerns?

873
01:25:57,529 --> 01:26:00,960
I agree with her.
Can't you do it for your parents?

874
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:03,399
Well, can't you do it for me?

875
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,880
I don't want this to be the reason
behind my marriage.

876
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,529
Are you sure your consultant
was talking about her?

877
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:10,920
It could be some other women.

878
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:15,479
He insisted that it'd be best
for you to marry the same girl.

879
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:18,529
Which means it can only be her.

880
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,399
Who is this consultant of yours?

881
01:26:22,609 --> 01:26:25,760
Does he personally know this woman?
His instructions seem specific.

882
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,720
He is the same person
who saved your life before.

883
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,039
And he specifically said
it should be her

884
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,880
because your mom asked him
to read Mook's horoscope.

885
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,359
His instructions are based on facts.

886
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:40,649
So, your only job is to

887
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,159
follow his instructions.

888
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:46,000
My life, my choice.

889
01:26:46,359 --> 01:26:48,960
I've decided
that I will not marry her.

890
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:51,960
It's fine if he doesn't want to.

891
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,569
But if something happens to him,
I'm not sure I can help.

892
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,239
I'm sorry that he's disregarding
my concerns for him.

893
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:04,479
- Your concerns for me?
- Hey, Lan.

894
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,439
Please try to be civil.

895
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,079
With this woman,
this is the most civil I can be.

896
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,039
I will never marry Praomook.
She's the woman I hate.

897
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:17,079
Lan.

898
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,319
I'd rather die than marry her.

899
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,680
Hey, Lan.

900
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,520
Stop. You can't say
something like that.

901
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:25,760
Lan.

902
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,840
Come back here. We haven't finished.

903
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:29,359
Lan.

904
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:32,079
I can't believe him.

905
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,920
Chalantorn will listen to
your presentation today.

906
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:49,279
This is Rawin.

907
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,800
If Lan keeps being
unprofessional like this,

908
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:59,159
I will not let him
take over this company.

909
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,399
How much do you want? I will pay you

910
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,920
to cancel this marriage.

911
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:14,319
Hey, what are you doing?
