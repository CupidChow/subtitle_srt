1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,039
I want to know who shot me.

4
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,759
You saved me just in time.

5
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,960
Did you tell him you saw
someone about to shoot him?

6
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,530
If I did, he would think
I was involved.

7
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,530
Alright, I'm a dead weight.
But let me ask you this.

8
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,919
Would helping Mom work
make me 100 million?

9
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,759
About compounding your debt,
the bank agreed to do it.

10
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
But we have to pay the outstanding
amount and the handling fee.

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,879
I will marry Lan.

12
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,800
I will never marry Praomook.
She's the woman I hate.

13
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,919
I'd rather die than marry her.

14
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,599
Lan, stop right there.
You can't say something like that.

15
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,080
Mook, don't mind him.

16
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,960
These days, he is against
everything I do.

17
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,159
That's right. Let's talk about this
when Lan is in a better mood.

18
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,479
Just to make sure,
do you agree to marry him?

19
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,319
About the marriage,

20
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,599
I'm going to be honest with you.

21
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,120
Go ahead, Mook.

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,759
I will marry him only if

23
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,879
your offer is still on the table.

24
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,639
Is this about your house?

25
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,039
Yes.

26
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,960
If you promise that you will help me
with my house,

27
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,439
I'm willing to be married to him
for a year.

28
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,039
Fifty million is actually
a lot of money though.

29
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
I don't think a year is enough.

30
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,439
Don't you think so?

31
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,479
But if you agree to marry him

32
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,599
and register the marriage
with him for a year,

33
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,240
we're going to deal with
your house for you.

34
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,520
And after a year of marriage,
the house will be your father's.

35
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,730
During this one-year period,

36
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,199
I'm going to buy it from the bank
and become the owner of the house.

37
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,800
However, your family can
continue to live there as usual.

38
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,959
When your father gets better,

39
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,050
he will be able to
return to the house.

40
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,000
And when the period is over,

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm going to transfer ownership
to your family.

42
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,920
Now, do we have a deal?

43
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,120
Yes, we have a deal.

44
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm heading to a meeting
with my client.

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,800
If anyone wants to see me, tell them
I won't return to my office today.

46
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,120
Okay.

47
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,959
She said she has business with you.

48
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,720
I told her I could relay the message
but she insisted on waiting.

49
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,879
Alright.

50
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,199
Oh.

51
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Alright.

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Poom.

53
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,240
Should I wake her?

54
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,240
- Figure it out. I'm leaving.
- Oh.

55
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,439
Yes, I'm on my way.

56
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,800
Wow. Looks like
she is having a good dream.

57
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,600
Who would dare wake her?

58
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
You have to attend a meeting
on my behalf. Fun's over.

59
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,800
I told you I won't work
at your company.

60
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,480
I don't care if you want to or not.

61
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,680
I told you to go and you must go.
This is an order.

62
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,600
And if you don't go to work,

63
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,720
I'll drag you there myself.

64
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,920
Alright. I'll attend the meeting.

65
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,919
Here you are. Everyone is waiting.

66
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,000
Did Dad tell you to
keep an eye on me?

67
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,240
No, he didn't.
I came here on my own.

68
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,039
I want to let you know
about the agenda beforehand.

69
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,159
In case you have
something to propose.

70
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,960
Who would buy my ideas anyway?

71
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,720
If your idea sounds interesting,
everyone would.

72
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,279
Prove yourself to them.

73
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,039
Why should I prove myself?
It's unnecessary.

74
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,600
Then you can just
listen to them instead.

75
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,639
That way, you'll be able to
answer Dad's questions.

76
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,919
Finally.

77
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,330
Chalantorn will be listening in
on today's presentation.

78
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,039
This is Rawin, manager of
product design and development.

79
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,519
He is going to
give the presentation.

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Nice to meet you.

81
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,330
Take a seat,
so we can start the meeting.

82
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,960
If you have any questions
or suggestions, feel free to talk.

83
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,919
Lak would dismiss me
if I suggest anything.

84
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,210
She won't do that.

85
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,559
If your idea sounds interesting,
everyone is willing to listen.

86
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,480
Let's begin the meeting.

87
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,679
This furniture collection
is designed for

88
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,240
townhomes, home offices,
and medium-sized condo units,

89
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,120
which require space and flexibility.

90
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,480
Wood tone is used to create
a relaxed atmosphere.

91
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,799
This collection is inspired by
Scandinavian design.

92
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,399
Please turn off your phone
during the meeting.

93
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Please continue.
Rawin's idea sounds nice.

94
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,960
As you can see, this collection
has a Scandinavian style.

95
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,279
The minimalistic style is emphasized
by the use of wood.

96
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,519
We also use recycled wood

97
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,120
to show that our products
are eco-friendly.

98
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,159
As a result, most of the components
are made of, along with leather,

99
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,879
recycled materials.

100
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,080
Drawing inspiration from
Scandinavian

101
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
and Japanese designs,
as well as minimalism,

102
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,320
we use wood as the main component.

103
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,960
Different types of wood
will be used, but the majority...

104
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,559
I think the design team has to
do better than our competitors.

105
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,960
This isn't a wow for me.

106
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,279
Also, marketing has to
cut down on unnecessary costs.

107
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,279
But I think we need to put money
into attracting a new target group.

108
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,480
- But I think...
- That's settled then.

109
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,200
Okay.

110
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,080
Anything else?

111
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,679
If there's nothing,
then I conclude this meeting.

112
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
Rawin, consider Danai's comments,

113
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,080
so you can get a pass next time.

114
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,879
Okay.

115
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
Your design is nice.

116
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,840
But from a marketing perspective,
yours can't beat the competitors',

117
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,080
resulting in bad profits.

118
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,080
When you design,

119
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,240
be mindful of the cost and market.

120
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,679
Can I leave now?

121
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,159
No.

122
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
Dad wants you to tour the company.

123
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,320
I can do that later.
I don't have time today.

124
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,480
But you seem to have
a lot of time on your hands.

125
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,480
You don't work. Dad is worried,
seeing you play around all day.

126
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,559
If you think I have a lot of time,
then I will do that for you.

127
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,240
But I don't have to listen to Dad.

128
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,799
Is that all you want to say?

129
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,559
Have a good day at work.

130
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
See you around.

131
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,799
I'm going to tell Dad
that you are irresponsible.

132
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,200
Go ahead. You can tell him anything,

133
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,240
so I don't have to be here.
Wouldn't you like that?

134
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,919
It's because you're
so irresponsible,

135
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,679
that's why nobody wants
to work with you.

136
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Being the CEO's son doesn't mean
you will get acceptance.

137
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
Nothing is earned easily.

138
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,759
I don't want to earn things easily.

139
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Now, if you will excuse me.

140
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,159
- Lak, come on.
- Grow up.

141
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,279
Dad can't put the fate
of the company in his hands.

142
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,559
Lak, he doesn't want to work here.

143
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,440
The more we try to force him,
the more he'll resist.

144
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,519
Our job is to look after
the company for him.

145
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,240
But that is totally unfair.

146
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,000
We've worked so hard.
And in the end, he gets the company?

147
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,720
Lak,

148
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
take it easy.

149
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,080
Danai, you keep saying that.

150
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,159
But you never do anything about it.

151
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm tired of you.

152
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,159
Dad.

153
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,080
I've tried my best
to save our house.

154
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,960
But it is so hard, Dad.

155
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I asked for help
from Uncle and Auntie.

156
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,279
In exchange, I have to marry Lan.

157
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,320
I don't want to do it, Dad.

158
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,799
I feel horrible.

159
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,279
But I have no choice.

160
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm sorry, Dad.

161
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,599
Please don't be mad at me
when you wake up.

162
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,920
(Use quality, natural materials.)

163
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,410
(Free of charge,
in Rayong and nearby provinces.)

164
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,920
(Chonburi, Chanthaburi,
Trat, Chachoengsao)

165
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,319
(Target groups: working-age, family,
elderly people, foreigners)

166
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
(Bring out products'
new and distinctive features.)

167
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,920
(Target groups: working-age, family,
elderly people, foreigners)

168
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,410
Are you here to talk about work

169
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
or vent your frustration?

170
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,920
Both.

171
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,519
Done.

172
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,000
Wow. This is beautiful.

173
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,119
Your skills have improved
since high school.

174
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,039
I think my company can hire you now.

175
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,680
Are you saying
I won't get hired if I am bad?

176
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,650
That's right.

177
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,650
After you graduate,
you have to work for my company.

178
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,920
Sure.
I will do anything for you, Lak.

179
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,599
Win,

180
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,440
you've seen Lan, right?

181
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,319
If he keeps being
unprofessional like this,

182
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,759
nobody will accept him.

183
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Maybe he is pretending to be
irresponsible to spite your dad.

184
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,480
Maybe

185
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,839
your little brother is
more capable than you think.

186
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,319
Why do you say that?

187
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,599
Those are your brother's ideas.

188
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,650
Do you still think

189
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,079
that he is incapable?

190
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,240
I don't think so.

191
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,279
This is nothing. If he was so sure,
he should've said it at the meeting

192
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,319
These papers

193
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,759
can't prove his capability.

194
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,920
And if he can't make me believe
that he can be a good executive,

195
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:49,170
I will not let him
take over this company.

196
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,119
You have to help me.

197
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,799
Of course. I will help you.

198
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,119
We've worked so hard.
And in the end, he gets the company?

199
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,640
Take it easy.

200
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,759
Danai, you keep saying that.

201
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
But you never do anything about it.

202
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,440
Which place? You pick.

203
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,559
- Oh, I remember now.
- You scared me.

204
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,519
- Which place?
- Auntie's place. The food is great.

205
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,240
Her spicy salad is to die for.
I'll take you there.

206
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,960
Is it the place we went to
with Ake that day?

207
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,119
That's right.

208
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,400
Hey, wait up.

209
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,559
You scared me.

210
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,279
Where is Rut? Is his meeting over?

211
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,720
Boss left already.

212
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,880
You were sleeping,
so I didn't wake you.

213
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Hey.

214
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,559
Wait. Why didn't you wake me?

215
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,079
You looked comfortable there.

216
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,640
I can pass on your message
to him if you want.

217
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,160
I don't want to bother you.
I'll come back later.

218
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,279
You don't actually have business
with him, do you?

219
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,480
You just want to see my boss.

220
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,880
Just admit it.

221
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,240
It's fine if you don't believe me.

222
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,680
My business with him
is really important.

223
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,160
What is it about? Can you tell me?

224
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,680
- I won't tell you!
- Hey!

225
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,839
Why did you have to yell?

226
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,839
Bye. I'll come back tomorrow
if I have time.

227
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,039
Part-time positions.

228
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,480
Is your company recruiting?

229
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,039
Hey.

230
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,519
Can I apply for this position?

231
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,880
How old are you?

232
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,759
Seventeen.

233
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,400
I'm almost qualified.
Please cut me some slack.

234
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,799
Thank you.

235
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,559
You've got some product review jobs.

236
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,240
I picked some clothes and products
that look trustworthy for you.

237
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,440
Now we wait for them
to send you their products.

238
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,599
Good.

239
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,400
Don't accept dietary supplements
because I don't actually take them.

240
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,519
Sure thing.

241
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,559
Here. I'll go.

242
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,559
Wait a second, Mook.

243
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,359
- What is that?
- Tissue paper.

244
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,920
- How did it get there?
- I know.

245
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
- I'll go now.
- Alright.

246
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,920
- Rut?
- Yes.

247
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I told you to be careful,
yet you're here alone.

248
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,079
I've got something to do.

249
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Why are you here anyway?

250
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,599
Did you come to hang out?
Or did you follow me?

251
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,680
I followed someone.

252
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,319
I don't think
you should get involved with her.

253
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,319
Why? Do you want to
keep her just for yourself?

254
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,599
Never.

255
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,799
I just want you to stay away
from that dangerous woman.

256
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,839
You will be in trouble
if she is involved with the bad guy.

257
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,319
The more dangerous she seems,

258
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:54,960
the more captivating she is.

259
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,799
Don't you care about my warning?

260
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,279
I do.

261
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,440
But the other thing
is more interesting.

262
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,200
Are you Lan?

263
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,319
Do you know me?

264
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,640
Don't you remember me?

265
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,640
It's too bad that
you and Lan are over.

266
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,799
Yes. He loves you.

267
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,960
He loves me, but he let Mook
mess around with my life.

268
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,319
He is weak and indecisive. He lets
other people control his life.

269
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,559
If he can't handle this,
how will he handle something bigger?

270
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,359
Don't you love him anymore?

271
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,920
Love isn't enough.

272
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,519
I want someone who can protect me.

273
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,799
Since Lan can't protect me,
I'm entitled to pick someone else.

274
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,119
We're young. We have lots of time
to find the perfect guy.

275
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,079
- She's right.
- Yes.

276
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,519
Lan.

277
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,839
(I'm sorry. Lan)

278
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Nuch.

279
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,480
It's good to see you.

280
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,559
Do you know him?

281
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,079
Yes, I was his girlfriend.

282
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,880
My name is Rut. I'm Lan's friend.

283
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,680
It's nice to meet
his significant other.

284
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,960
The thing between me and her

285
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,480
is in the past now.

286
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,519
I've never forgotten about the past.

287
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,799
Lan, let's get back together.

288
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,359
Let's find somewhere
we can talk alone.

289
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,839
Alright.

290
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,480
Have fun tonight.
I'll see you next time.

291
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,839
Mook, where are you going?

292
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,119
Lan.

293
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,440
Let's start over.

294
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,839
Who are you?

295
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm his girlfriend.

296
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,759
You're crossing the line, Praomook.
I'm not your boyfriend.

297
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,359
Praomook.

298
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,480
I haven't seen you in a long time.
You've changed.

299
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,920
But you're still the same person.

300
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,519
Does Lan accept it when
you tell people you're dating him?

301
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,519
Or are you making it up again?

302
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,240
Who are you?

303
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm Treenuch. Do you remember me?

304
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,319
Get out of Lan's life.

305
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,119
No. If you want him,
you have to go over my dead body.

306
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,769
You're asking for it.

307
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,880
What are you doing? Let go of me.

308
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,289
- Let go.
- You decided to try me.

309
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Let go!

310
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,639
Let go!

311
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,329
Don't let me free,
or I will kill you.

312
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,039
You can't do anything to hurt me.

313
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,559
Let go!

314
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
If you keep showing up in his life,

315
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,239
I'm going to make Lan hate you.

316
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,159
Let go.

317
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,840
I remember everything you did.

318
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,480
So do I.

319
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,960
It's just a superstitious marriage,
but you thought he belonged to you

320
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,480
and accused me of stealing him
when I didn't.

321
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,329
He can date anyone he wants.

322
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,440
That's all in the past now.

323
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,840
I'll tell you about
the current situation.

324
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:30,239
Lan and I are getting married.

325
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,679
And it isn't my imagination.

326
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,519
He is mine.

327
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Is that true, Lan?

328
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,719
It's true.

329
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:50,480
Excuse me.
I need to talk to my future bride.

330
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:54,960
We'll talk later.

331
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,519
Bye, Nuch.

332
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,599
(Oak)

333
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,960
Give it back.

334
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,809
Where are you taking me?

335
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:38,360
You will find out soon enough.

336
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,159
Just get it over with.
I've got a job to do.

337
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,719
What job?

338
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,360
DJ job or something else?

339
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,360
Just say it if you dare.

340
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,440
What do you think will pay as well
as marrying me for money?

341
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,400
What do you call it?

342
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,079
- Prostitution?
- Stop it.

343
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,920
You don't like it
when I state the truth.

344
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,599
What you're doing
isn't different from prostitution.

345
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,239
- Lan.
- I'm right, aren't I?

346
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,920
You're disgusting.

347
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
Alright.

348
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,289
Tell me how much money you want
and I will pay you

349
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,329
to cancel this marriage.

350
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,840
No. I don't want your money.

351
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,920
Are you saying that
you don't want my money,

352
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:33,880
that you are marrying me
because you want me and love me?

353
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:36,329
How emotional.

354
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,360
Just admit that
you want my parents' money.

355
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:43,239
You haven't changed at all.

356
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:46,840
You still look down on me,
just like before.

357
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
I've always been this bad.

358
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,840
And if you're hoping you can
make me fall in love with you,

359
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:53,199
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

360
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,289
Pull over.
I have nothing to say to you.

361
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,639
No.

362
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,289
Lan, I said stop the car.

363
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,769
No, I won't. Find a way
to stop it if you want to.

364
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,960
Hey! What are you doing?

365
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,769
You haven't seen Lan in ages,

366
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,559
and yet you found the right person.

367
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,440
Even Lan didn't recognize you.

368
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,329
Maybe...

369
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,199
you already knew who he was.

370
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:26,679
Lan.

371
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,440
Lan, Lan!

372
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Lan!

373
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,079
We're stuck in here. Help.

374
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Lan!

375
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,159
Help!

376
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,920
Please help.

377
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Help us. Please.

378
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:27,159
Oh no.

379
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:33,679
Lan! Help! Help!

380
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,119
Anybody, help!

381
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,000
Help!

382
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Help!

383
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,880
Help!

384
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:48,840
Help!

385
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,840
We're stuck in here. Help.

386
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,289
- Lan.
- Hey. This is the rescue squad.

387
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,559
- Are you alright?
- Lan.

388
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,840
- Please help my friend.
- We're trying to get you out.

389
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,329
- They're stuck. Get the tools.
- Okay.

390
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,840
Hey, are you alright?

391
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,679
I'm following his account.

392
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,329
So you've been researching him.

393
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Yes.

394
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,119
What do you want from him?

395
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,039
It's none of your business.

396
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,329
Alright.

397
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:23,079
I'll find the answer myself.

398
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
What? You were in a car crash?

399
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,239
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

400
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,519
Hey.

401
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,400
Your friend was in an accident.

402
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,559
- On three. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

403
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,199
Deep breath.

404
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,880
What is your name, sir?

405
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,400
Chalantorn.

406
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,809
- Lan.
- Careful, miss. You are injured.

407
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Mook.

408
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,159
Are you alright?

409
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:40,559
What is taking them so long?
When will he come out?

410
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:42,719
I don't know.
I just came here with you.

411
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,440
- Oak.
- Mom.

412
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,360
- How is Mook?
- Where is she?

413
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,559
The doctor is taking care of her.

414
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:55,599
Please keep her safe.

415
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,480
- You.
- You.

416
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,809
You're DJ Prao's little sister.

417
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,559
Unbelievable.

418
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,480
Why? Is it because
I'm not as pretty as Mook?

419
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,289
I didn't say anything.

420
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,079
Your eyes said it all.

421
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,289
I'm just surprised
at how small the world is

422
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,440
and the fact that you're her sister.

423
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,159
Who are you to her anyway?

424
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:40,840
An acquaintance, I guess.

425
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,960
According to your EKG
and the x-rays, you're fine.

426
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,480
However, we have to monitor
your injuries and bruises.

427
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:55,320
If you don't any symptoms,
you'll be released shortly.

428
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,480
Okay.

429
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,159
Your results are normal.

430
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:00,480
But I want to monitor
your condition for a while.

431
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,599
If there are no complications,
you will be able to go home.

432
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:05,719
Okay.

433
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,719
- How are you?
- How are you?

434
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,000
It's a little painful.
How about you?

435
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
It's painful.

436
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
But I think

437
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,400
I can handle it.

438
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,559
Hey, what are you doing?

439
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Wait.

440
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,960
You caused the car to flip over.

441
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,559
You abruptly turned the wheel,
making us skid off the road.

442
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,280
I always get hurt when I'm with you.
You're a jinx.

443
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,159
But a jinx like me just saved you
from getting murdered.

444
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,320
- What did you say?
- Hey.

445
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Careful.

446
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,400
What did you say earlier?

447
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:18,840
Who was trying to murder me?

448
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,679
- Answer me.
- You're hurting me.

449
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Let go. If you don't let go,
I won't tell you anything.

450
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:35,719
A man had followed us on a bike.

451
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,239
I saw him about to shoot you,
so I turned the wheel.

452
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,239
And while you were unconscious,

453
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,519
he walked toward you with a gun.
So I called for help.

454
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,760
Did you make an enemy with someone?

455
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,719
This is the third time
he tried to shoot you.

456
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:54,199
Third time?

457
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,000
I can count two.

458
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,039
The first time was when I met you
in Korea, and then today.

459
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,079
The second time was when we were
almost hit by a bike.

460
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,639
I saw a man about to shoot you,
so I pushed you out of the way.

461
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,440
My only enemy is you.

462
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,480
And every time I was in trouble,
you were always there.

463
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:20,440
This is your plan.

464
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,840
What?

465
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,119
The first attempt,
I saw the shooter.

466
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,920
But the last two attempts,
I saw nothing.

467
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,320
You've made this up

468
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,960
so that my parents will believe
what the fortuneteller told them

469
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,880
and make me marry you.
It has all fallen into place.

470
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,320
You're ridiculous.

471
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,000
If I wanted that,
I wouldn't risk my life like that.

472
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,920
Right, you're not stupid.

473
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,519
You put your life at risk to
convince me that you saved me.

474
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,400
Because you're the girl in prophecy.

475
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,960
I know a cunning girl
when I see one.

476
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:54,440
Listen to me.

477
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,480
I'd rather be shot to death
than marry you.

478
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:00,039
Lan, where are you going?

479
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,159
Lan.

480
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,559
Lan.

481
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,719
Oak, why is it taking so long?
Will she be okay?

482
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,360
She will be okay.

483
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,039
- Praomook.
- Mook.

484
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,559
Mook.

485
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,800
- How are you?
- Here, let me hold it for you.

486
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,440
It's only a minor injury.

487
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,039
The doctor said
it will be better in a few days.

488
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,400
Hello, Da.

489
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,079
I'm Lan.

490
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,679
Lan, I haven't seen you in
a long time.

491
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,239
You two seem to be in bad shape.

492
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,880
I think you should
stay the night at the hospital.

493
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,480
Mom, I'm really okay.

494
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:58,840
Lan.

495
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,800
How are you?

496
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:04,480
I was worried about you.

497
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,440
Dear, hurry.
Should we ask reception?

498
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,400
- Dear, he is over there.
- Oh, Lan.

499
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,440
- Lan.
- How are you? Are you hurt?

500
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,599
Oh no. You're bleeding.
Where does it hurt?

501
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,000
Let me see.

502
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,119
You know, I was so worried
when I heard the news.

503
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,360
I was so scared for you and Mook.

504
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,760
- Oh no. Look at this.
- Dear, slow down.

505
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,239
He is in pain.

506
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,760
- I'm just worried.
- You can slow down.

507
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,480
- Hello, Mom and Dad.
- Hello.

508
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:47,079
- Lan, did you hit your head?
- What did the doctor say?

509
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,360
Do you have to be admitted?

510
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,639
That won't be necessary.
The doctor did some tests on me.

511
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,960
No bone fracture. No concussion.

512
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,400
I just have a few bruises
and a headache.

513
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,920
- I can go home.
- Are you sure?

514
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,800
When you get hurt, you always
suffer more than normal people.

515
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,800
I think you should stay
the night here just to be sure.

516
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,440
I'm not that weak.

517
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,800
Your sister is worried about you.

518
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:14,679
But it's good that you're alright.

519
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,199
Mook.

520
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:19,400
How are you, Mook?

521
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,199
This bruise looks painful.

522
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,679
Does it hurt?

523
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,800
You're safe now, dear.

524
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,360
I'll be fine.

525
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,119
That's good to hear.

526
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,639
Can you tell me what happened?

527
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:40,599
- Well...
- I will tell you about it.

528
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,559
So you swerved
and skidded off the road.

529
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,760
Be careful next time.
Don't drive too fast.

530
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,800
Do you see it, Lan?
It's exactly like the prophecy.

531
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,719
Because of Mook, you survived.

532
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,719
Mook, thank you, oh sorry,

533
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,400
thank you so much, dear.

534
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:16,880
You saved his life again.

535
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,199
You're right, dear.

536
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,079
I can't imagine what would happen
to him without her.

537
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:22,960
I think it's purely coincidental.

538
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,159
He happened to be with her.

539
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,039
He happened to swerve
to avoid a car. That's all.

540
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,960
It has nothing to do
with the prophecy.

541
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,480
Maybe it wasn't coincidental.

542
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:37,639
Maybe it's my and Lan's destiny.

543
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,039
It wasn't a coincidence or destiny.

544
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,000
It was obviously an accident.

545
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,719
You survived because the engineer
that made the car did a good job.

546
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,440
Right. This horrible accident

547
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:56,639
has made me believe that
my son is having bad luck.

548
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,199
And because Mook was there,
she was able to save you.

549
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,559
Don't you think that
she is bringing me bad luck?

550
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,119
- No.
- No.

551
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,360
Do you see it, Mook?
You can save him.

552
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,239
Without you, he would have faced
something even worse.

553
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,400
So you must help him.

554
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:21,599
You must marry him
as soon as possible.

555
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,679
Please, Mook.

556
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,039
- You must do it quickly.
- I won't marry her.

557
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,639
- Lan.
- Dear, talk to him.

558
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
Lan.

559
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:38,239
Hey.

560
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,480
Wait up, Lan.

561
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,639
Lan, please listen.

562
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,679
Don't make a big deal out of it.
Just do as I say.

563
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:05,039
I can't marry her

564
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:08,280
because I already have a lover.

565
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
What?

566
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,719
And my lover is also here.

567
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Who is it?

568
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,639
Now that it has come to this point,
I guess I have to tell you.

569
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,360
Rut and I aren't just best friends.

570
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:30,079
We are lovers.

571
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,039
Lan, what are you doing?

572
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,280
This isn't funny.

573
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,400
Just play along with me.
I'll tell you about it later.

574
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
No.

575
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,400
If you don't play along,
I will have to marry your DJ.

576
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,119
Marry?

577
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,760
Yes. You have to help me, man.

578
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:15,639
Rut won't let me get married.

579
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
Right?

580
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Right.

581
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:23,400
I won't let him marry Praomook.

582
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,400
Because we love each other so much.

583
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,079
That's not true. You like women.

584
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,800
We used to date.

585
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,039
How can you like men?

586
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,599
Did breaking up with me
make you hate women?

587
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:58,239
I'm sorry for making you
become this way.

588
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,039
My love for him
has nothing to do with you.

589
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,400
Our relationship ended.

590
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,519
He is the person
in my life right now.

591
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,039
Right, love?

592
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,159
This isn't true.
I don't believe you.

593
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,599
Lan, do you think we are stupid?

594
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,079
A playboy like you is always
with a different girl.

595
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,639
Suddenly you came out as gay.

596
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,840
I know you're making this up
to avoid the wedding.

597
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,039
If you don't believe me,
I will prove it to you.

598
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,360
What?

599
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:20,840
I can't marry you.
I don't like women.

600
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,559
You're not convincing at all.

601
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:27,159
When you met me in Korea,
you were all over me.

602
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,960
Korea...

603
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,679
I can vouch for that.

604
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,079
Is that true, Lan?

605
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,159
Why didn't you tell me that
you met her in Korea?

606
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,719
It's not important.
I forgot about it.

607
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,920
What?

608
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,840
You and your friend imagined it.

609
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:48,039
I was just enjoying the moment.

610
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,599
Is it true that you love him?

611
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,800
Exactly. I think you're lying.

612
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,880
You are always in the news
with a different woman.

613
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,159
At the launch event,
I saw you go out with a woman.

614
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,360
It's a cover-up.

615
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,880
Why does he need a cover-up?

616
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,639
Being gay is acceptable nowadays.

617
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,519
Unless you just turned gay
ten minutes ago.

618
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,199
Ten minutes and thirty seconds.

619
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,800
I'm waiting for your answer.

620
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,880
What do you think?

621
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:41,400
If you want to know the truth,

622
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,599
you should look for it yourself.

623
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,840
Hey.

624
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,400
Stop bothering my boyfriend.

625
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,199
- I haven't finished talking to him.
- That won't be necessary.

626
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,360
Just know that
Marut and I are in love.

627
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,079
And I will never marry you.

628
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,800
What are you doing?

629
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,039
Rut, I'm sorry for
taking him away from you.

630
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:27,559
But I'm doing this to protect him.

631
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:31,199
If you truly love him,
please let me marry him.

632
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:35,000
I don't want anything
to happen to him.

633
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,760
- You...
- If there is another choice,

634
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,760
I honestly wouldn't
hurt your feelings like this.

635
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:46,639
Let go of him.

636
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,840
You're the worst.
Are you trying to manipulate him?

637
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,559
You don't care about me.
You just want to beat me.

638
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,199
I really care about you.

639
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,719
I know you don't
believe the prophecy.

640
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:03,119
But can't you do it
for your parents?

641
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,480
No.

642
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,360
I can't let you marry him.

643
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,360
I can keep him safe.

644
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,280
I don't have to bother you.

645
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,519
Oh, I'm losing my mind.

646
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,880
A playboy like you suddenly
announces that you like men.

647
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,119
What will people think of me now?

648
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:35,599
- Let them think whatever they want.
- Lan!

649
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,639
Quit riling him up.
Do you want him to go crazy?

650
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,440
He asked me and I answered.

651
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:51,199
Uncle and Auntie, don't worry.

652
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,719
Although he doesn't love me,

653
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,400
I'm still willing to marry him.

654
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,440
I will protect him from bad luck.

655
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,800
Oh, Mook.

656
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:06,920
Thank you so much for your help.

657
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,519
You're an angel.

658
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,840
Praomook, are you out of your mind?

659
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,679
You know I have a boyfriend,
and you're still taking me from him.

660
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm not taking you from him.

661
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,639
I'm doing this for Uncle and Auntie.

662
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,119
I'm doing you a favor by
marrying you and hiding your secret.

663
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,039
But I don't want your help.

664
01:00:26,199 --> 01:00:27,559
I do.

665
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,559
Mom.

666
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,920
I don't mind if you love him.

667
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:35,119
You must marry Mook anyway
to ward off bad luck.

668
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,360
- But...
- Don't argue. This is our belief.

669
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Look at yourself, Lan.

670
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,239
You have a head injury,
not to mention the bullet wound.

671
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,360
It's obvious that you're
having serious bad luck.

672
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,159
Lan, I don't want to see you
being bedridden again.

673
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,079
So you must marry her
as soon as possible.

674
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,440
I won't do it.

675
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,239
And if you don't change your mind,

676
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,920
the only person
I will be with is Rut.

677
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:12,519
Hey.

678
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:21,800
So DJ Prao
was your childhood friend.

679
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,480
Your dad and hers know each other.

680
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,480
And you two were married
superstitiously once

681
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,119
because you were extremely ill.

682
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,079
Right.

683
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:34,360
Now your parents think
you're having bad luck,

684
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,559
so they want you to marry her again.

685
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,760
- Right.
- But you don't want to.

686
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,480
Right.

687
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,760
I get it that
you don't want to marry her.

688
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,320
That's why you told them you're gay.

689
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,920
But why did you have to say
that I'm your boyfriend?

690
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:56,199
There are plenty of women.
Why didn't you pick one?

691
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,039
Treenuch, your ex, was there.
Why did it have to be me?

692
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,639
If it was another woman, they'd try
to make me marry the duckling.

693
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,840
Telling them I'm gay
is more effective.

694
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,400
Besides,

695
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:17,119
I'd be in trouble if I picked
a woman and she didn't play along.

696
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:20,320
You are the perfect option.
You won't give me trouble.

697
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,599
When it's over, it's over.

698
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,440
Right.

699
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:25,159
My life will be over now.

700
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,719
You told people I'm gay.
It's going to ruin my reputation.

701
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,280
I know, man.

702
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:33,480
I promise that I will
clear your name once this is over.

703
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:37,719
Your women won't go anywhere.
They know you're straight.

704
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:42,239
Trust me.
I'll keep that just among us.

705
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,079
I'm just asking you one thing.

706
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,719
Protect me from Praomook.

707
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:50,760
Look. You're saying that
as if you're a victim here.

708
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,719
Be honest with me.
Why don't you want to marry her?

709
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,559
She is pretty, smart, and sexy.

710
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,119
When you didn't realize
she was your childhood friend,

711
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,400
you were interested in her.

712
01:03:03,239 --> 01:03:05,039
Because she is Praomook.

713
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,360
A girl who is so selfish
it disgusts me.

714
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,039
I hate her more than
anything in my life.

715
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,079
Are you sure you hate her?

716
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,199
Yes, I hate her
and will never love her.

717
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:21,239
Good.

718
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:23,440
If you don't like her,

719
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,400
I'm going to pursue her.

720
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,760
No. You can't.

721
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:31,880
Why not? Are you jealous?
But you said you hate her.

722
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:33,679
I'm not jealous.

723
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,440
If you pursue her, she will
find out that you're not gay.

724
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:39,559
That will ruin my plan.

725
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,960
Don't worry.

726
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:47,920
I'll pursue her without her knowing.

727
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,760
And if I win her over,

728
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,559
she will give up the idea
of marrying you.

729
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:56,119
This is a win-win for you.

730
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,079
Whatever.

731
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,960
If you insist
that you don't like her,

732
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,840
I will help you, my good friend.

733
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,280
Good.

734
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,639
You can do whatever you want
as long as

735
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,159
you get the bratty duckling
out of my life.

736
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,239
Don't worry.

737
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:31,280
You know
I've never missed my target.

738
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,840
I'll prepare you a meal so you can
eat before taking your medicine.

739
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:07,239
Okay.

740
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,920
Are you marrying Lan
to save this house?

741
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:14,559
- Why are you asking me that?
- I want to know the answer.

742
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,199
Why do you want to marry him so much

743
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,559
that you don't care if he has
a lover or how he feels about it?

744
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:22,920
You're giving up your dignity.

745
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,760
You don't care about what's right.

746
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:27,039
Why are you doing this?

747
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,800
You wouldn't understand
if I told you.

748
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,360
Why don't you try me
and let me be the judge of that?

749
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,360
I'm not a clueless kid anymore.

750
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,239
Answer the question.

751
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:47,800
Do you really have to do this?

752
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,079
Thank you so much
for agreeing to marry him.

753
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,920
Mook.

754
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:02,280
I'm sure that Lan isn't dating Rut.

755
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,039
I'm positive he likes women.

756
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:06,880
You don't know that, Dad.

757
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,800
Maybe he's never had a serious
relationship with a woman

758
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,920
because he is dating Rut.

759
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,639
If what he said is the truth,
Dad, what would you do?

760
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,800
Why do you have to
upset us with that?

761
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,480
I'm just stating the facts.

762
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,119
What about you, Dad?

763
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,360
If your favorite son likes men,

764
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:29,119
will you force him
to marry Praomook?

765
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,000
I will do it as soon as possible.

766
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,159
It doesn't matter if he is gay
or straight, he has to marry Mook

767
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,840
to ward off bad luck
just like the fortuneteller told us.

768
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,599
Your brother is in serious danger.

769
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,039
Mook, I'll set a date
for the wedding as soon as I can.

770
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,840
And during your one-year marriage,

771
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,360
you have to find out
if he is gay or not.

772
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,039
If he is, you have to do anything
to change his mind.

773
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,559
And if you can change him,

774
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:03,639
I'm willing to give you
anything you ask for.

775
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,320
Dad, you can't make
a promise like that.

776
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,599
If she wants money or our shares,
we will have to give them to her.

777
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,280
Come on, Lak. Why not?

778
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,199
They are all my possessions.

779
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,519
I can give them to whoever I want.
It has nothing to do with you.

780
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,320
Please, Mook.

781
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,320
Looks like

782
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:27,599
you're an extremely lucky woman,
Praomook.

783
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,760
You can just sell your body to
save your family from bankruptcy.

784
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,199
Lak, you can't say that.

785
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,639
We're the ones
who went to her for help.

786
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,599
She never asks anything of us.
We're willing to give her anything.

787
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:43,320
She might not do it now.

788
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,039
But we don't know about the future.

789
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,360
It's late. We all must be tired.

790
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,840
Let's go home and get some rest.

791
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
Besides, Praomook is injured.

792
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:01,679
You're right.

793
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,360
Mook, go home and get some rest.

794
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,320
We'll talk about this later.

795
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,880
Da.

796
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,319
We'll talk about the wedding later.

797
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,039
Okay. We'll talk later.

798
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,279
But now, I'm not so sure

799
01:08:29,529 --> 01:08:32,359
if I will let them get married.

800
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,840
Da.

801
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,800
Do you have to sell your body
for this house?

802
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,569
Yes, I have to.

803
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,439
Because if I don't,
we'll lose this house.

804
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:57,119
There are many ways
to keep this house.

805
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,159
You don't have to degrade yourself.

806
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:01,680
Petch, watch your language.

807
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,649
This is the best I can do.

808
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:06,399
You don't agree
with her decision, do you?

809
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,960
See? She doesn't agree with you.

810
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,159
It's just a superstitious wedding
like the one I had before.

811
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,039
What about your deal
with Uncle and Auntie?

812
01:09:19,649 --> 01:09:22,720
You agree to be their in-law and
live your life as his wife, right?

813
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,079
Not to mention the fact that
you have to find out if he is gay.

814
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,720
I can already tell
how demeaning it will be for you.

815
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,199
Is it worth it?

816
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,800
It is worth it
if we get to keep this house

817
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,239
and pay for Dad's medical expenses.

818
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:38,199
There must be another way.

819
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,720
A way that won't make people
look down on you and our family.

820
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,359
Then you tell me.

821
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:44,800
What's better than this?

822
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,880
I'm going to find a job.

823
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:51,199
I'm going to make money.

824
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:55,079
- I'm going do part-time jobs.
- You can't do it.

825
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,039
I can do it. Don't underestimate me.

826
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,319
That small amount of money
won't help us.

827
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:04,119
I make more and I can't even pay
the interest. Forget the principal.

828
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,720
If I really want to make money,
I can do it.

829
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:13,960
Then tell me
when you'll get that money.

830
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:16,720
As soon as possible.

831
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:18,569
You can't answer it.

832
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,720
But the bank, court, and hospital
already set the due date for us.

833
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,840
If you can't answer that,
you don't get to complain.

834
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,800
Right.
I'm not pretty or smart like you.

835
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:31,960
I can't do anything.

836
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:36,720
Have you ever asked us how we feel
about what you're doing for us?

837
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,680
I don't agree with this.

838
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Let go.

839
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:46,319
I don't care that
you don't agree with me.

840
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,680
My decision remains the same.

841
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,840
Whatever.

842
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,199
You never listen
to me anyway, right?

843
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:28,239
I know you don't agree with this.

844
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:32,479
That's why you're hesitant
about the wedding.

845
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,960
But this is the only way out.

846
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,609
Even if I have to give up
my dignity, I'll take this path.

847
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:43,079
Mom, do you understand me?

848
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,840
I understand.

849
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,960
But you should have told me.

850
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,199
I shouldn't have to hear this
from someone else.

851
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:50,880
You're wrong about this.

852
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:56,760
We're family.
This is an important matter.

853
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:01,569
I'm sorry.

854
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,760
I didn't think about that.

855
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,399
Next time, talk to us.

856
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,079
Although Petch is young,
she is your little sister.

857
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:18,319
Okay.

858
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,159
There's one more thing
that makes me feel hesitant.

859
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,720
It's because I care about you a lot.

860
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,920
According to the prophecy,
you might get hurt saving him.

861
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:40,279
What if you get married
and something happens again,

862
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:44,439
I'm scared that something bad
will happen to you.

863
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:55,439
The fact that your dad is bedridden
right now is bad enough.

864
01:12:56,649 --> 01:12:58,649
If something happens to you,

865
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:02,079
I won't be able to take it.

866
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,319
Mom, it was just an accident.

867
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:11,119
Today wasn't prophesied.

868
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,159
I will be more careful from now on.

869
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:43,960
There are many ways
to keep this house.

870
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:46,159
You don't have to degrade yourself.

871
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:52,920
You're an extremely lucky woman,
Praomook.

872
01:13:53,649 --> 01:13:57,680
You can just sell your body to
save your family from bankruptcy.

873
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,960
What you're doing
isn't different from prostitution.

874
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:02,609
Alright.

875
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,960
Tell me how much money you want
and I will pay you

876
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,960
to cancel this marriage.

877
01:14:37,649 --> 01:14:39,159
Hang in there, Mook.

878
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,399
Even if you can't, you have to.

879
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:20,359
Do you like men or women?

880
01:15:28,279 --> 01:15:31,159
If he goes both ways,
what should I do?

881
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,439
(Forget about the plan.)

882
01:15:42,569 --> 01:15:45,119
(For now, try to get close to him.)

883
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:49,279
(I will tell you about
the next move later.)

884
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:01,079
(Okay. Don't forget my reward.)

885
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:10,569
(I won't. You'll get more.)

886
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,609
Lan! Help! Help!

887
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
Help!

888
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,680
Lan has a slight fever.

889
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,800
He has a fever?

890
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,800
Is he okay? If he gets worse,
please take him to the hospital.

891
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,649
Do you want us to pick him up?
We don't want to bother you.

892
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,920
He can stay at my place.

893
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:42,960
I'll let you know
if anything happens.

894
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,359
Bye.

895
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,800
Are you happy?

896
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,920
Yes.

897
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:55,359
Being at home is exhausting.
I'm going to stay at your place.

898
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,399
Don't you care if
I'm inconvenienced?

899
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:00,920
Stop talking. My head hurts.
I want to rest.

900
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,279
What's wrong with him?

901
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,239
He has a house. Why does he
have to stay somewhere else?

902
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,840
But this is his boyfriend's house
that we're talking about.

903
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,159
Dear, don't say that.
My heart hurts.

904
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:26,319
Honestly, do you believe
that they are dating?

905
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
I don't.

906
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:31,000
But I still can't help but wonder.

907
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,359
I'm sure that he made this up.

908
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:35,720
And I'm looking forward to seeing
how far he is willing to go.

909
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,439
What worries me the most though,

910
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:40,279
is that Da may not
let her daughter marry him.

911
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:43,649
Totally. Da must be worried
about her daughter.

912
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,039
If I were her,
I would be worried too.

913
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,239
But the only person I want him
to marry is Mook.

914
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:53,119
Exactly.

915
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,039
We've come this far.
We have to keep going.

916
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:01,479
Mook gave us her word
that she will marry him.

917
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:04,680
I don't think
she will change her mind so easily.

918
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:06,880
I agree.

919
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,439
- Right?
- Right.

920
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,119
Alright.

921
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,119
- You're here.
- Yes.

922
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,880
I don't know whether to
laugh at you or feel sorry for you.

923
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:31,239
If you're going to laugh at me,
you can go home.

924
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,960
You must be sore.
Why don't you take a few days off?

925
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,720
I guess I will.

926
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,649
- Mook, can I ask you something?
- Is it about the marriage?

927
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,720
Yes. You want to marry him
even though he already has a lover.

928
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:51,279
I don't think it's okay.

929
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,649
It makes you look like
you're stealing someone's boyfriend.

930
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:59,920
If they really love each other,
then it's wrong of me.

931
01:20:00,359 --> 01:20:02,359
But I'm sure he is lying.

932
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,760
He and Rut aren't dating.

933
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,680
From what I've heard, Lan goes out
a different girl every night.

934
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
The chance that he is gay is zero.

935
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,359
You're gay, you should know this.
Use your gaydar.

936
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:19,239
Right. That's why I was surprised
when he came out.

937
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:22,119
But I'm warning you
because I care about you.

938
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,279
I know. I will keep it in mind.

939
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:33,159
Alright. If I feel certain that they
are dating, I won't get in the way.

940
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,079
And I will talk to Uncle about it,
then I will leave him alone.

941
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:39,319
Okay.

942
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,279
Lan, I brought you a meal.

943
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:13,649
How do you feel?

944
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,199
I don't have to worry about him.

945
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:45,119
Rice porridge.

946
01:22:56,279 --> 01:22:57,399
Where is Petch?

947
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,960
She left early in the morning.

948
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:01,680
Where did she go?

949
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,569
Why are you here?
Are you here to see my boss?

950
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,760
I'm not here to see Marut.
I'm here to apply for a job.

951
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:28,359
Apply for a job?

952
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,960
Yes, I'm applying for a job.

953
01:23:34,529 --> 01:23:38,359
Tell me, M. What do I have to do
to pay off our debts?

954
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:41,609
M?

955
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:52,239
Right. The part-time job.

956
01:23:57,359 --> 01:23:58,880
If you like games,

957
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,840
especially ones created by Mars Wiz,
you will have an advantage.

958
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:05,800
That's me.

959
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,000
Hey, wait up.

960
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,239
Hey, come on.

961
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:30,880
Listen. If you're applying for a job
because you want to be close to him,

962
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:33,399
you can stop that right now.
This is a workplace.

963
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:36,479
Boss is mean, vicious, and ruthless.

964
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,439
He isn't the same man
you've met at events.

965
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:42,039
Appreciate him from a distance.
I don't want to disappoint you.

966
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,569
I really want to work here.

967
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,000
Your boss is my idol.
I want to learn from him.

968
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:50,079
Here is my resume.

969
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,000
(Name: Nampetch Wongnuannang
Date of birth: October 22, 2002)

970
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:08,079
This is my playthrough video.

971
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:10,569
Did you make this yourself?

972
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,319
Yes. I made all of them.

973
01:25:22,439 --> 01:25:23,720
You have talent.

974
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:41,920
Woah. You're at a very high level.

975
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,920
Great job.

976
01:25:50,439 --> 01:25:53,479
But I'm sorry to say that
you're unqualified in terms of age.

977
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,920
I already told you this.

978
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:58,649
Age is just a number.

979
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,399
Rules are rules.

980
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,039
Come on. Please bend the rules
for me just this once.

981
01:26:06,359 --> 01:26:09,159
Don't make that face.
I won't be soft on you.

982
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:15,039
Complete the form and wait here.

983
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,960
Someone will call you
for an interview.

984
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,920
There are a lot of applicants today.
You've got to fight for it.

985
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,479
If you don't make it,
you don't make it.

986
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:28,319
This is all I can do for you.

987
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:31,119
Alright.

988
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,960
Thank you.

989
01:27:20,039 --> 01:27:21,359
Mook.

990
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:24,960
Lim and Pat are here to see you.

991
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,359
I get it. You worry about your son.

992
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:42,319
But I don't want to
sell my daughter for money.

993
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:43,960
It really seems like
they love each other.

994
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:46,239
Is my sister going to be
the other woman?

995
01:27:46,359 --> 01:27:50,640
It's time for Lan to do his duty
as the family's heir.

996
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,439
Your and Danai's job is to
take care of the company for him.

997
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,880
I think you may have some ideas for
our products. Are you interested?

998
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,399
This is temporary.
We'll be married for only a year.

999
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,000
Or are you scared that
you will fall in love with me?

1000
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,119
I'm scared that
you will drag me down.

1001
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:08,199
What Mook told you is true.
Someone did try to shoot you.
