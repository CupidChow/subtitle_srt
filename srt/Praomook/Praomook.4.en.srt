1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,159
If you will help me with my house,

4
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,530
I'm willing to be married to him
for a year.

5
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,840
And if he can't make me believe
that he can be a good executive,

6
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,810
I will not let him
take over this company.

7
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,000
A man had followed us on a bike.

8
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,319
I saw him about to shoot you,
so I turned the wheel.

9
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:45,560
This is the third time
he tried to shoot you.

10
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
- What do you want from him?
- It's none of your business.

11
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,039
Alright.
I'll find the answer myself.

12
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,240
You like women. We used to date.

13
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,240
How can you like men?

14
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
Our relationship ended.

15
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,360
He is the person
in my life right now.

16
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't marry you.
I don't like women.

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,479
Be honest with me.
Why don't you want to marry her?

18
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,240
Because she is Praomook.
Her selfishness disgusts me.

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
I hate her more than
anything in my life.

20
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
I hate her and will never love her.

21
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
The date for the wedding.

22
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,840
It's two weeks away.

23
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
I think it's too soon.

24
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,719
The longer we wait,
the worse it will be for Lan.

25
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,080
He was shot and had a car accident.

26
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,520
We can't wait anymore.

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,960
I get it. You worry about your son.

28
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
But to be honest with you,

29
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,159
I don't want to
sell my daughter for money.

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,319
You're not selling your daughter.
You're helping my son.

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,319
Look, Da.
Don't take this the wrong way.

32
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,560
This is a win-win for all of us.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,520
Since Mook is helping my son,

34
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,919
we want to help you
and your family in return.

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,439
But your offer is a lot of money.

36
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,759
Da, I understand you.

37
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:07,360
However,
Pethai has helped me many times.

38
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:10,680
One time I was close to bankruptcy

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,520
and he let me borrow his money.
Everything I am is because of him.

40
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,240
Now that his family
is having a tough time,

41
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
it's normal for me
to want to help him.

42
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,920
Please.

43
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,199
- I'm begging you.
- No, Pat.

44
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,170
I accept your offer.

45
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,240
If Pethai knew about this,
he would let Mook marry Lan.

46
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,199
Da, thank you so much.

47
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,279
So,

48
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,170
do we have your permission
to host the wedding?

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Yes.

50
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,639
There's one more thing
that I need your help with.

51
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,920
What is it?

52
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,610
I want you to work for my company.

53
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,000
Just tell me what field
you want to work in,

54
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
your position, and expected salary.
And I'll arrange that for you.

55
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,170
But on one condition.

56
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,199
Within a year, you have to get
Lan to come to work.

57
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,199
If you can do that,

58
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,079
I will clear all of
your father's debts.

59
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,720
Okay. I will work for your company
and will get him to come to work.

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,240
It's time for him to grow up.

61
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,319
You can tell me
what position you want.

62
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,319
I'll tell Lak to arrange it for you.

63
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,560
Consider it is your company.

64
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,480
Hi.

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,079
Hi.

66
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,360
According to Mook's resume,
she has a degree in interior design.

67
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,480
I think it's best to have her work
with Win in product development.

68
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,240
Keep an eye on her
and report to me on her every move.

69
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
Got it?

70
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,199
Alright.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,439
What makes you distrust her?

72
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,560
I don't trust her. I'm afraid
she will try to steal from us.

73
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,639
Mook, what position
do you want to be in?

74
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,759
Do you want to be in management?

75
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,759
It will be a perfect position for
my future daughter-in-law.

76
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,680
She has no work experience though.

77
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
If she works outside her field,
she will be seen as privileged.

78
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,360
That will look bad on us.

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,839
Why would it look bad on us?

80
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,680
You and Danai don't have a degree
in your line of work either.

81
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,600
And you seem to be doing fine.

82
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,959
Everyone knows it's nepotism.

83
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
So what?

84
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,160
Danai and I are working
outside of our specialties

85
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,519
because the company
had issues with people back then.

86
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,519
I'm saying this

87
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,560
because I'm worried that

88
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,079
Mook won't get to do
what she is good at.

89
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,959
Win's team has
an available position.

90
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,959
If he has a graduate
with honors to help him,

91
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
it will be great.

92
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
I agree.

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,439
My team needs a fresh pair of eyes.

94
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,919
I think she may have
some nice ideas for our products.

95
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you interested?

96
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
I'd like to work in design
like Lak has suggested.

97
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,720
That's great.

98
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,679
Design is one of the key components
of our company.

99
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,960
Then I'll have Win give her
a tour of the department.

100
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,450
Win, please take care of Mook.

101
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,039
Of course.

102
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,879
Please follow me.

103
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,759
Lan, they approved our proposal.

104
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,639
Let's get to work then.

105
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,090
Hey.

106
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,519
What's wrong? Don't be modest.

107
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,639
- What's up with you?
- What?

108
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,919
- Come on.
- Lan!

109
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,840
- Let's go.
- I know. I can walk.

110
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
- Just go.
- We can walk like normal people.

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,399
It really seems like
they love each other.

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Is my sister going to be
the other woman?

113
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,450
This zone has furniture
for the family market.

114
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,639
These sofas are minimalistic
and made of mainly wood.

115
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,450
Look at these products. You might
get an idea for a new concept.

116
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay.

117
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,000
- Can I talk to you about this?
- Sure.

118
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,279
Give me a moment.
You can look around the place.

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sure.

120
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,799
- Hello.
- It's me, Praomook.

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,159
Duckling, why are you calling me?

122
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,360
I'm at your father's company.

123
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,919
I agreed to work for him.

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,960
What are you trying to do?

125
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,399
Nothing.

126
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,840
I heard from your father
that you don't want to work here.

127
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,440
As your future wife,

128
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,480
I'll fill in for you.

129
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,279
When we're married,
the company will be mine.

130
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,399
You finally revealed your evil plan.

131
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,919
Are you a leech
trying to suck my father dry?

132
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,519
Stop calling me
a duckling or a leech.

133
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,960
My name is Prao.
Is your brain damaged?

134
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,399
Maybe it's better to have
a mindless, brain-damaged husband.

135
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,279
The denser he is, the better.

136
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,440
Now I will be able to take
everything that belongs to you.

137
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,639
The company belongs to my dad.
I don't care if he gives it to you.

138
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,559
You can do whatever you want.
Don't call me again. It's annoying.

139
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,759
Why did Mook call you?

140
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Mook?

141
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,039
When did you become close to her?

142
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,799
Since I decided to go after her.

143
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,399
You're making a mistake.

144
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,879
The duckling called me,
saying she is at the company.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,159
She is trying to take over
my father's company.

146
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,799
It's your father's company.

147
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,639
So why are you angry?

148
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm not angry. I'm just frustrated
by the idea of being scammed.

149
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,279
She's willing to do anything
for money. No dignity at all.

150
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,679
Hey. You're being too harsh.

151
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,799
You said she went there to work.

152
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,320
She is being useful.

153
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
At least in your father's eyes,
she is reliable, unlike you,

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
who causes trouble every day

155
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,919
and refuses to go and work for him,
even after graduation.

156
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,759
He thinks you're
an uncommitted, immature,

157
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,519
stubborn, ungrateful son
who likes to fool around.

158
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,799
Rut, you don't have to
try to sound like him.

159
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
I'm your friend.
You should be on my side.

160
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,919
I'm neutral.

161
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,960
If I were your parent,
I would adore Mook more than you.

162
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,200
- You're unfair.
- Of course.

163
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,039
What is it, Poom?

164
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,919
I've got the video from
the security camera you asked for.

165
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,759
Mook.

166
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

167
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,519
I'm Natdanai,

168
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,000
Lak's husband
and Lan's brother-in-law.

169
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,799
Okay.

170
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,759
I heard you will be working here.

171
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,360
Do you want to be
an assistant manager?

172
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,120
I've been looking for
someone to help me.

173
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,879
I'm not good at management.
I'd rather work in design.

174
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,080
You can always tell me
if you change your mind.

175
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,759
As a daughter-in-law, it's good to
be knowledgeable about management.

176
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,360
So you can help Lan out
in the future.

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,919
I'll help him once he comes to work.

178
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
That's good.

179
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,039
Anyway, do you want to get
the general idea about management?

180
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,960
Sure.

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Follow me.

182
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
I tried to get videos from different
angles, but they were low-quality.

183
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,320
The traffic cameras
don't use HD technology.

184
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:36,000
That bike was intentionally
following you.

185
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
This is...

186
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,039
Is that a gun?

187
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
A man had followed us on a bike.

188
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,080
I saw him about to shoot you,
so I turned the wheel.

189
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,039
And while you were unconscious,
he walked toward you with a gun.

190
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,960
So I called for help.

191
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,039
What Mook told you is true.

192
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,879
Someone did try to shoot you.

193
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,120
Being hunted down like this,
did you step on someone's toes?

194
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,840
- I don't know.
- Exactly. You had no idea.

195
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,360
How would I know?
I was fighting with Mook.

196
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,240
Mook is a key witness.

197
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,679
To me,

198
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,080
she is a suspect.

199
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Lan.

200
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,799
Please sit here. I'll call you when
it's your turn to do an interview.

201
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
May I have your resume?

202
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,320
- Wait.
- What is it?

203
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
Can I have a minute with you?

204
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,200
Are these people applying for
the same position as I am?

205
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
Yes.

206
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,840
Why are there so many people?

207
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,000
Our company is one of the best
in the gaming industry.

208
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,879
Although this is a part-time job,
it's a way to advance your career.

209
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,679
That's why we do formal interviews
just like any other positions.

210
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,679
I'll call you when it's your turn.

211
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,679
Alright.

212
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,159
Peerapat.

213
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,039
It's your turn.

214
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,919
Boss.

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,080
What is it?

216
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,639
Will you interview the candidates?

217
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,480
- Nampetch?
- Here.

218
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,840
It's your turn.

219
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,120
- Please follow me.
- Okay.

220
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,559
Please go over there.

221
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,680
- Well...
- Please take a seat.

222
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,200
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

223
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,359
You don't meet
our first qualification.

224
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,200
Why are you applying for the job?

225
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,119
Because I want to work here.

226
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,359
I don't want to
miss the opportunity.

227
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,890
In my opinion, age is just a number.

228
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,839
It can't determine how good
someone is at their job.

229
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
Are you saying you're good?

230
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,440
I'm confident in my skill set.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have applied.

231
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,960
Anybody can say that.

232
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,839
I can give you an example of
how age doesn't matter in work.

233
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,599
You.

234
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,359
Go on.

235
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,559
You started working at a young age.

236
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:35,920
You built this company
when you were 18 years old.

237
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,839
You became an influential person
when you were 20,

238
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,960
becoming an idol to many people.

239
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,119
If age did matter,

240
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,000
you would've waited until for
the right age to start your career.

241
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,759
That's why I think
age is just a number.

242
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,319
People's skills are more important.

243
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,650
Complimenting me

244
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,960
won't give you extra points.

245
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,650
I'm simply stating the facts.
I don't want anything in return.

246
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,039
I don't believe that Mook can
get Lan to come to work.

247
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,839
You saw it.
He doesn't want to marry her.

248
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,170
Bringing her here

249
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,599
will only push him away.

250
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,319
I don't think he will come here
because he wants to see her.

251
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,799
I think

252
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,759
Praomook will know a way
to get him to work here.

253
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,799
Exactly. I believe she can do it

254
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,960
because she knows him well.

255
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,000
That was when they were still young.

256
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,039
Since Lan went abroad,
we barely saw her.

257
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,410
I think she even avoided us.

258
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,599
Mook and Petch
didn't come to my wedding.

259
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,039
Lan and Mook are strangers
at this point.

260
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,240
Come on. With this matter,

261
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,240
they will know each other better
once they get married. Am I right?

262
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,920
That's right.
They will eventually become close.

263
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,200
If he doesn't want to work here,

264
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,599
just let him be for now.

265
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,519
You don't have to ask
an outsider for help.

266
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,119
Danai and I can run this company.

267
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,170
Lak,

268
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,440
it's time for Lan to do his duty
as the family's heir.

269
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,720
Your and Danai's job is to
take care of the company for him.

270
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,599
We all have our duties.

271
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,079
Alright.

272
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,079
Let's see how Mook is doing today.

273
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,799
Come on, dear. Let's go.

274
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,039
That's a good idea. Let's go.

275
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,240
- Come on.
- Alright.

276
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,559
Come on, Lak.

277
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,279
Let's go.

278
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,960
Hold on.

279
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,759
Dear, is that Lan?

280
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,319
I'm not hallucinating, right?

281
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,599
You're not hallucinating.
It's really him.

282
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,440
I can't believe

283
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,799
Mook got him to come here
on her first day of work.

284
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,079
Maybe

285
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,599
she knows a way
to get him to work here.

286
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,839
We're on the right track, dear.

287
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,359
We have to follow them now.

288
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,079
Lak, do you see? Lan's come to work.

289
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,720
- He is here. Let's go, Lak.
- Dear, let's go.

290
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,200
Hurry.

291
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,680
We're targeting Asian
and European markets.

292
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,680
That's why we use modern designs.

293
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,880
We want our products
to remain timeless.

294
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Alright.

295
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,599
- Right.
- I like this design.

296
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
- This one has a European style.
- Okay.

297
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
It's a top-selling product.

298
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,079
I have to talk to you.

299
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Lan.

300
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,039
I can't let you out of my sight. You
throw yourself at any man you see.

301
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,960
Are you mad?
You insulted me out of nowhere.

302
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,559
Leave Danai alone.

303
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,079
The more you say no,
the more I want in.

304
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,680
If you do it,
I will make you regret it.

305
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,319
Is that all you have to say?

306
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Let go.

307
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,680
You said someone tried to ambush me.
I believe you now.

308
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,240
So? If you want to say
that you're grateful for my help,

309
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
go ahead. I'm listening.

310
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,960
You're behind everything.

311
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
What are you talking about?

312
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,400
You saved me several times.
It's too coincidental.

313
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,119
You walked into my life
at the same time the attacker did.

314
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,720
You made the fortuneteller tell
my parents that I have to marry you.

315
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,279
You've planned everything.

316
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:01,960
I didn't do it.

317
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,319
If I'd wanted to do that, I'd have
picked a richer and nicer guy.

318
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
You can't pick anyone else
because you're in love with me.

319
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:11,599
You're full of yourself.

320
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,200
Your actions speak volumes.

321
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,839
You've planned to marry me,
sleep with me,

322
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,759
and get pregnant so you can have me.

323
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
Your mind is dirty and disgusting.

324
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,559
I would never try to trap a jerk
like you by getting myself pregnant.

325
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,680
I can be worse.
Do you want to try me?

326
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,200
- Let go.
- You hurt me, I hurt you.

327
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:36,599
You wrong me, I wrong you.

328
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,119
Let go.

329
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
You sent someone to attack me,
didn't you?

330
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,000
- I didn't do it.
- Stop denying it.

331
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,799
I know a way to make you talk.

332
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,559
Lan, get off.

333
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,279
- Lan!
- Lan!

334
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,680
What do you think you're doing?

335
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,720
What's going on?

336
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,960
Here are the games I've played.

337
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,920
I play all kinds of games
and I'm at a high level in each.

338
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
Being good at playing games

339
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,319
doesn't mean
you will be good at your job.

340
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not showing you the video
to make you see my skill.

341
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,440
It's to show you
that I'm a serious person,

342
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
that I know each game's
strengths and weaknesses.

343
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:58,200
And being a player myself,

344
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
I know your customers' needs.

345
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,240
You wrote in the application form
that you can dance.

346
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,799
Can you show us your talent?

347
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Sure.

348
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,039
Lan, even if you don't like women,

349
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,039
you can't touch her like that.

350
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,799
You disrespected her.
You have to take responsibility.

351
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,680
That's right.
You have to be a gentleman.

352
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,200
You have to take responsibility.

353
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,359
If you do this,
it will settle everything.

354
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,079
This is the wedding date.

355
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,920
The fortuneteller
set the date for us.

356
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,039
You will get married in two weeks.

357
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,519
Take it.

358
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,240
- Lan!
- Lan!

359
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,440
What are you doing?

360
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,519
I'm not marrying her. Don't take
advantage of the situation.

361
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,400
It's you who took advantage of her.

362
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,400
You're saying it like
I'm a bad person.

363
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,400
Aren't you curious why
I don't want to marry her?

364
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
Are you trying to say

365
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,839
that you're in love with Rut?
You don't have to repeat that.

366
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,279
That is one of the reasons.

367
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,720
The thing is, she has a boyfriend.

368
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,440
And I don't want to
steal someone's girlfriend

369
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,480
because I'm not as shameless
as your favorite girl.

370
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,319
Is this true, Mook?

371
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,079
This man isn't my boyfriend.

372
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,839
If you want a confirmation,
I can arrange it for you.

373
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,960
Boss, what is your decision?

374
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
Just say it if she is hired or not.

375
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,720
Don't keep quiet.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

376
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,920
When can you start?

377
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,279
I can start anytime.
I'm available every day.

378
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,799
Then I'll have human resources
let you know when you will start,

379
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,359
because you're under 18
and still in high school.

380
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,359
This is a summer break.

381
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,119
Plan your schedule
with your supervisor.

382
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,759
- Get the hiring process right.
- Yes, Boss.

383
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

384
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,519
Deal.

385
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,480
Thank you so much, Marut.

386
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,440
- I will work hard.
- Hey.

387
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,440
Take it easy.

388
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Okay.

389
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,519
I've got a job.

390
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,799
See you tomorrow. Bye.

391
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,079
Were you watching your girl?

392
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,559
She isn't my girl.

393
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,960
But you hired her.
Are you sure it isn't favoritism?

394
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,799
There is no favoritism
in our company.

395
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,880
I see. This means you hired her
because of her skill set.

396
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,920
I know you're
a forward-looking person.

397
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,160
It's normal.

398
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,480
I think she can be useful,
so I hired her.

399
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
How?

400
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,839
I guess I should look for
a new CEO's assistant too.

401
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,759
A client meeting
is next on your schedule.

402
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,039
My name is Oak. I'm her best friend

403
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
and her manager.

404
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,920
Her manager. Does this mean
she is a very busy person?

405
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,000
She is very busy, ma'am.
Let me show you.

406
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,039
She is a DJ with
hundreds of thousands of followers.

407
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,839
She has a lot of offers. My job is
to filter through things for her.

408
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,119
Are you sure you're just friends?
You are always with her.

409
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,079
If you're more than friends,
just say it. Don't lie.

410
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,720
As her manager, wherever she goes,
I have to accompany her.

411
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,359
She works at nightclubs.

412
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:17,960
You know it's dangerous for a woman
to be out alone at night.

413
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,400
- Yes, I know. It's very dangerous.
- I agree.

414
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,359
And because I'm worried about her,
I always accompany her

415
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
and keep men from bothering her.

416
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
- I see.
- You do the right thing.

417
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,839
He can say whatever he wants.

418
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,960
Lan, don't interrupt us.
We haven't finished talking.

419
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,559
I assure you that he is my friend.

420
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,279
There is nothing more,
despite what some people may think.

421
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,240
Besides, I love being a DJ.

422
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:50,680
I assure you that
she only works as a DJ.

423
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,359
She does this

424
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
because she wants to make money
and she loves music.

425
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,359
She makes music too.
I'll play one of her mixes.

426
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,200
She makes music.

427
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,880
Let's listen to it.

428
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,160
Oh dear. You're brilliant.

429
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,640
- Here you go.
- Did you make this?

430
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,480
- Oh.
- Wow.

431
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
Dear.

432
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,000
Take it easy.

433
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:27,160
This reminds me of when I was young.

434
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,200
Dad, Mom. This isn't the time
to entertain yourselves.

435
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,400
We're having a serious conversation.

436
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,920
Okay. I'll be serious.

437
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,839
Alright.
Now that I've heard everything,

438
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,640
I can conclude that she will be
the perfect daughter-in-law.

439
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,440
She is perfect in every way.

440
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,000
Wow.

441
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,640
You've known to make a living
since you were in school.

442
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,279
You're motivated and diligent.
You're much better than him.

443
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,319
Dear.

444
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,440
Alright. In short,

445
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,160
Mook is the perfect girl
to be my daughter-in-law.

446
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,000
I stand by my statement.

447
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,360
You have to marry her
no matter what.

448
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,920
Don't you suspect that
the car accident

449
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,840
might have been her and
the fortuneteller's plan?

450
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,599
It's too coincidental that he
specifically said it has to be her.

451
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,960
There are other women
who were born on that day.

452
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,480
I think there must be
something more to this.

453
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,769
There is nothing more to this.

454
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,599
Master is a man of virtue.

455
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,719
He wouldn't do a nonsensical
thing like that.

456
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,519
More importantly,
Mook doesn't know him.

457
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:41,840
Lan, this is temporary.
We'll be married for only a year.

458
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,599
I've given up many things for you,

459
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,039
why are you dismissing
everyone's concern for you?

460
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,329
I don't want to get married
because it's you.

461
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:51,000
If it were someone else,
I'd have said yes already.

462
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,769
What's wrong with me?

463
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,000
Or are you scared that
you will fall in love with me?

464
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
I'm scared that
you will drag me down.

465
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,880
Besides, I don't want to hurt Rut.

466
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,079
I can talk to him for you.

467
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:10,159
If he loves you and knows that
I'm marrying you

468
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,159
to save your life,
he will agree to this.

469
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,360
After everything I've said, you're
still insisting on marrying me?

470
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,639
What Mook told you is true.

471
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
Someone did try to shoot you.

472
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:29,809
Mook is a key witness.

473
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,840
To me, she is a suspect.

474
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,519
Alright. If you guys
want me to marry her,

475
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:40,769
I will do it.

476
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,329
Hold on, Lan.

477
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,079
Are you serious?

478
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
You gave me your word.

479
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,480
But we will be married
for only a year.

480
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,840
After that, I'll choose my own path.

481
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,480
You won't get to have a say
in anything I do with my life.

482
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,039
If you're okay with that,

483
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,360
you can set the wedding date.

484
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Okay.

485
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,960
You must stay married
to her for a year.

486
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,639
After that, I don't care
what you do with your life.

487
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:24,199
However, if you don't
stay married for a year,

488
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,239
I will disinherit you.

489
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,809
Everything
will become your sister's.

490
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,119
And part of the inheritance

491
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,480
will go to Mook

492
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,360
as compensation.

493
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,599
Dad, you can't hand
your legacy to a stranger.

494
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,519
I agree.

495
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,960
Why can't I?

496
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,119
They are my possessions.
I can do anything with them.

497
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,809
One more thing,
if you stay married for a year,

498
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,719
I'm going to give you
everything you want.

499
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,039
If you want your sister
to run the company,

500
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,769
if you want to hire someone
to work for you, you can do it.

501
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,559
Go ahead. I won't get in your way.

502
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:17,719
What about me? Why do I get nothing?

503
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,809
No, Lak. You can have mine.

504
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,329
I will give you all my possessions.

505
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,880
It's still unfair.

506
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:26,769
Why does something that's
rightfully mine

507
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,880
have to be used
as a bargaining tool?

508
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,559
Lak, don't be hostile toward
your parents.

509
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,119
Shut up, Danai.

510
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,559
I didn't ask for your opinion.

511
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,440
Alright. Let's settle this first.
Lan, what do you say?

512
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,329
Alright.

513
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,480
I will marry this woman for a year.

514
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,809
You have my word.

515
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:03,920
Congratulations. You've successfully
convinced me to marry you.

516
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,289
- Lak, no.
- Let go.

517
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,809
Let go. I'll delete everything.
I don't care anymore.

518
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,199
- Let go.
- Lak.

519
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:22,440
Calm down.

520
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,199
I can't stay calm anymore.

521
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,079
Look at what he did to me.

522
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,329
It's like I'm not his kid.

523
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,159
Everything is about Lan.

524
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,519
What do I have to keep
working so hard for?

525
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:37,960
What for?

526
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,480
Dad just said it
to convince Lan to get married.

527
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,960
Mom said she will give you
all of her possessions.

528
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,880
I want the company shares
and she can't give me that.

529
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,199
I've sacrificed so much for this.
I have to have them.

530
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,519
Dad can't give them to
his unappreciative son.

531
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:03,960
Will I ever be worthy in his eyes?

532
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,239
You still have me.

533
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,599
You're always worthy to me.

534
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:24,039
You told me you were going to
investigate the shooter.

535
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,400
Instead, you gave your word
that would marry Mook.

536
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,000
Do you even think about me?

537
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,719
Rut, you...

538
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,880
This is frustrating.

539
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,960
I pretended to be your lover
in front of people.

540
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,199
I ruined my playboy reputation
to stop your wedding.

541
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,809
How could you abandon me like this?

542
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,440
I didn't abandon you.
I agreed because of the conditions.

543
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,719
I will be married to her for a year.
After that, it's over.

544
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,289
I get my freedom.
The duckling will be out of my life.

545
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,719
Everything is over.

546
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,840
Anything can happen in a year.

547
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,599
That's right. It's why you have to
pretend to be my boyfriend.

548
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,769
See? I didn't abandon you.

549
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,679
We're still lovers.

550
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,079
Lan, you!

551
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,119
Rut, that really hurt.

552
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,159
If I were the attacker,
you would be dead.

553
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:29,960
You're the worst.

554
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,360
Let's hear it for the bride.

555
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,960
What are you doing?
Let me hear you scream.

556
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,440
Aren't you happy
that he agreed to marry you?

557
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
Why would I be happy?
This isn't a marriage based on love.

558
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,239
Why? Do you want to marry for love?

559
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,809
It's not like that.

560
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:29,809
Forget about the reasons,
let's celebrate.

561
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,039
You're about to have a husband.

562
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,809
What's good about marrying
someone else's man?

563
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,329
Lan and Rut aren't lovers.
Everyone can tell they're lying.

564
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,719
I have proof.

565
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,769
Proof that they're lovers.

566
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,679
Woah.

567
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,559
Maybe they really are lovers.

568
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,039
No, I guess.

569
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,519
This is obvious.
Do you still want to marry him?

570
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,079
I will marry him no matter what.

571
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,239
Mook.

572
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,400
Wait. Let's calm down.

573
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,719
Petch, where did you
get this picture?

574
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,199
Right. Where did you get it?

575
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,199
Someone sent it to me.

576
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:40,480
- Really?
- Really?

577
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,960
Anyway, I don't agree with
this marriage.

578
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
That's all I have to say.

579
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,039
Mook, maybe they really are lovers.

580
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm not so sure anymore.

581
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,199
I have to prove it.

582
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,159
Lan, it's me.

583
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,960
Danai, you scared me.

584
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,119
It's me. Who did you think I was?

585
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,960
It's nothing.

586
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,360
Why are you still awake?

587
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,400
I was waiting for you.

588
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,960
Is there something urgent?

589
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,360
It's not urgent. But it's important.

590
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,519
I want to know about the ambush.

591
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,360
How did you find out about it?

592
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,159
I overheard
your conversation with Mook.

593
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,840
This is serious.
Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,960
Why did you say it was an accident?

595
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,440
The person who saw
the attacker was Mook.

596
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,239
When we were in the hospital,
I thought she was lying.

597
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,840
After I got the video from traffic
camera, I realized it was true.

598
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,000
Can you see the attacker's face
in those images?

599
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:12,639
Do you have any leads?

600
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,079
His face is covered.
The license plate number is blurry.

601
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,719
Are you saying you've got no leads?

602
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,079
Yes.

603
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,400
Lan, you have to go to the police.

604
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:33,119
I'll do that later.

605
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,840
I want to find out who is behind it
before I go to the police.

606
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,679
I want irrefutable evidence
to settle it once and for all.

607
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:43,960
What will you do
if he attacks you again?

608
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,280
It's good if he does,
I'll get my chance to catch him.

609
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,880
Don't worry. I won't die easily.

610
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,599
Alright then.

611
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,960
If you find out who he is
and want to go to the police,

612
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,199
you have to tell me.

613
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,559
I will.

614
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,400
Don't worry.
I can look after myself.

615
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,480
How can I not worry?
You're my brother.

616
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,960
Be careful.

617
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,280
I should clean myself up.

618
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,159
Congratulations. You successfully
convinced me to marry you.

619
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:43,239
Why are you calling me?

620
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,239
I miss you.
I want to hear your voice.

621
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,480
We'll be together in a few days.

622
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,159
In your dreams.

623
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,320
I will dream about you tonight.

624
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,719
Should I dream about
being in your arms

625
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:00,440
or having you in my arms?

626
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,960
Or

627
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,039
something else entirely?

628
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,360
Never touch me in your dreams.

629
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:11,519
You're modest.

630
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,760
You can do anything to me
in your dreams.

631
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,880
You can touch my hand,

632
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,559
caress my arm,

633
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,079
my shoulder,

634
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:25,599
from my shoulder to my neck,

635
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,960
and slide your hand down to...

636
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:37,760
Stop.

637
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,719
Why? I haven't finished.

638
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,599
Stop trying to seduce me.
I don't feel anything.

639
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,519
That's too bad.

640
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,719
I'm going to bed. Bye.

641
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,800
Good night, love.

642
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,840
I'm going to get you.

643
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
Lan, don't think.

644
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,320
Don't think about the duckling.

645
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
No.

646
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,239
Don't think.

647
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:12,639
Don't think.

648
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,920
If you stay married for a year,

649
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,199
I'm going to give you
everything you want.

650
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:37,519
Alright.

651
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,960
You have my word.

652
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,559
Darn it.

653
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,960
Lan, you must be dreaming.

654
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,719
Are you really going to get married?

655
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:55,519
This is ridiculous.

656
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,920
Darn it.

657
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,960
Why are you here?

658
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:20,119
Your parents asked me
to pick you up.

659
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:21,519
Where are we going?

660
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:22,840
We're going to try on
wedding dresses.

661
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:25,760
- I'm not going.
- You have to.

662
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,880
If you don't go, I will tell your
parents that you're not complying.

663
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,280
And I will tell them that you want
a big wedding with 500 guests.

664
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:37,960
I have another condition.

665
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,480
What is it?

666
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,280
I want a private wedding, just us

667
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,840
since we'll divorce
after a year anyway.

668
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,320
I agree with him.

669
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,519
I thought you wanted a big wedding

670
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,239
so you can announce to everyone
that you've finally caught me.

671
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,360
Or are you scared that
other men will find out?

672
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,039
That's right.

673
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,519
Alright.

674
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:01,800
But we're going to
do it according to customs.

675
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,079
More importantly,

676
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,239
you will have to
register the marriage.

677
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Alright.

678
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,119
After a year, I'll get a divorce.

679
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,360
I'll give you one hour.

680
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,639
Pick your dress
and get it over with.

681
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,280
Do you see that?
I knew she could make him go.

682
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,760
Although this is a small wedding
based on superstition,

683
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,320
I want her to wear a beautiful gown.

684
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,320
He thinks it's just a marriage
based on superstition,

685
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,599
to me, this is the real thing.

686
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,960
I told him
it will be over after a year

687
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,760
just to make him agree with me.

688
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,440
- You're amazing.
- Oh.

689
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,199
- That's what I have in mind too.
- Right?

690
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:00,559
I think Mook is a lovely girl.

691
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:04,159
She can make him fall for her
so that he doesn't want a divorce.

692
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:10,519
She is perfect for him.

693
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,400
I won't let her slip through
my fingers.

694
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,440
You read my mind.

695
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,119
Give me a hug.

696
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,280
Come this way please.

697
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,119
You can try on any of the gowns
that you want to.

698
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,639
As for the groom...

699
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,079
I'll handle it.

700
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,280
- Of course. Please take your time.
- Okay.

701
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:39,440
Lan, what do you think
about this one?

702
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
It's average.

703
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:49,639
Well, looks like my groom
doesn't like this gown.

704
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,760
Where is my suit?
I'd like to try it on.

705
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:39,320
Your suit is over there.

706
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,199
Lan, you must not feel anything.

707
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,639
Control yourself.

708
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,440
Excuse me.
Could you attach the bow tie for me?

709
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,920
Let me help you.

710
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,320
No. I can do it myself.

711
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:33,719
If you could, it would've been done
a long time ago.

712
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,400
Why can't you attach
a simple bow tie? Are you alright?

713
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,440
I'm fine.

714
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,440
I can hear your heartbeat.

715
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:06,519
Or maybe it's my imagination.

716
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,360
Nonsense. My heart is fine.

717
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:13,119
You're right. You like men.

718
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,079
You wouldn't feel anything
when you're around me, right?

719
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,800
And if I get closer to you,
you wouldn't feel anything.

720
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,440
When we get married

721
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,039
and get closer,

722
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,360
will you stop loving Rut
and love me instead?

723
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,239
No.

724
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,159
Sorry. I can't let him fall for you.

725
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,079
(Lan: Rut, help me!)

726
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,280
Lan.

727
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,800
You have to help me right now.

728
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,280
If you don't,
your DJ Prao is going to get me.

729
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,079
Although I'm allowing you
to marry him,

730
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,119
it doesn't mean you can have him.

731
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:46,880
Did you hear that?

732
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:49,559
I won't stop loving him.

733
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,599
Even if you give yourself to me,
I won't have you.

734
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,159
When did I give myself to you?

735
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,679
I see. Was it earlier?

736
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,119
I just helped you get dressed
and asked some questions.

737
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,559
Your mind is probably
full of dirty thoughts.

738
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,960
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

739
01:00:08,599 --> 01:00:12,039
I'm a calm, reasonable man.

740
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,000
I know that the purpose of
this marriage is to save his life.

741
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:16,599
It doesn't come from love.

742
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,760
However, you should
also remind yourself

743
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,960
not to fall for him.

744
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,599
Because if you do,
I won't be able to keep my cool.

745
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:31,280
Rut, I just realized
how much you love me.

746
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:37,239
If you want me,
you have to kill him first.

747
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,840
I'm not dying for you.

748
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,039
Don't be mad. I'm just joking.

749
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Remember this, duckling.
Although we're getting married,

750
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,159
you will never get my heart.

751
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,079
Disgusting.

752
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,960
I know you spent
your childhood together.

753
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:05,719
But that is the past.

754
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:07,719
I'm the present.

755
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,559
I won't let him fall for you.

756
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:12,159
If you don't want to get hurt,

757
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,079
during your year together,
don't develop feelings for him,

758
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,519
don't fall for him,

759
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:19,239
because he will never love you.

760
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:24,760
I will keep that in mind.

761
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:27,079
But please tell your man

762
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:29,360
not to develop feelings for me
or fall for me either.

763
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,679
He might be the one who regrets it.

764
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,199
That day won't come.

765
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,480
That brat was clearly seducing me.

766
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,719
If you had been a second late,

767
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,239
I'd have tied her wrists and ankles.

768
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,800
What kind of woman is she?

769
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,760
That's duckling abuse.

770
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,400
I'm the victim here.

771
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,639
This is just the beginning.

772
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,480
I can't imagine what she will do
after the wedding.

773
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,880
Why are you complaining?
You agreed to marry her.

774
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,199
If I didn't, my parents would've
found another way to convince me.

775
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,840
Besides, I have my reasons.

776
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,239
Firstly, to stop my parents
from pestering me.

777
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,320
Secondly, I have to get close to her

778
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,519
to find out if the attacker
and Praomook are connected.

779
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,519
Thirdly, I will get my freedom
if I can fulfill the agreement.

780
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,400
Wouldn't you agree to that
if you were me?

781
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,920
I'd agree to the marriage the second
I found out she was my bride.

782
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,480
You're lost.

783
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:50,880
Giving up your freedom
for a worthless woman.

784
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,159
Lan, you shouldn't
judge her unfairly.

785
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,079
She is helping you
because you are childhood friends.

786
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,639
Or maybe she still loves you.

787
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,199
She loves my parents' money.
It's why she's sold herself to them.

788
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,039
- Lan.
- Enough. Stop trying to defend her.

789
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:13,639
To you, she is a pretty,
harmless woman.

790
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,920
To me,

791
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,880
Praomook is a sly, scheming woman.

792
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,400
Once I have proof that
she is behind the attacks on me,

793
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:24,320
I will throw it in your face
so you can finally wake up.

794
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:26,800
I'll wait and see

795
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:29,960
if you're right or wrong.

796
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
Alright.

797
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,480
Hello.

798
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:42,039
I'm free all day.

799
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,519
Alright. I'll see you soon.

800
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,159
I have a date.

801
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:53,840
Call me if there is
an update about work.

802
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
Alright.

803
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,199
Rut.

804
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,960
I want to talk to you
about something.

805
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:47,519
I want to talk to you about
something. Can we meet?

806
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,119
Don't be quiet. Reply to me.

807
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,519
We used to be friends.

808
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,199
I'll wait for you.

809
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,599
Why did you hit me?

810
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,679
You embarrassed me
in front of other people.

811
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,559
Look at me. I look awful.

812
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,239
No one has ever done
this to me before.

813
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,519
But your girl attacked me.

814
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,199
Mook isn't my girl.

815
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,920
I love only you.

816
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:31,280
I don't believe you.

817
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,480
You must have given her hope.
That's why she dared to do it.

818
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:42,199
My friends warned me to stay away
from you because you're taken.

819
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,679
But I didn't listen,

820
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,480
because you've always
treated me so well.

821
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,920
In the end, you showed me

822
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,360
that we aren't supposed
to be together.

823
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,079
Nuch, please give me another chance.

824
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:00,079
No.

825
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,960
Lan,

826
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,760
let's break up.

827
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,760
Nuch.

828
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:08,719
From now on,

829
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,360
we're strangers.

830
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,239
Nuch, wait.

831
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,079
You said you want to talk to me.
I'm listening.

832
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,880
I want to be your friend. Can I?

833
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,159
You want to be my friend.

834
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,119
Yes.

835
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,480
You seem like a good person.
I don't want to be your enemy.

836
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,280
But I don't want to be
friends with you.

837
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,360
I understand that you don't like me.

838
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,199
Anybody would be angry

839
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,079
to find out that another woman
is marrying their lover.

840
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,840
That's one reason why
I'm upset with you.

841
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,039
I don't see what good it will do
if we become friends.

842
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,159
It will only benefit you.

843
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:13,840
Am I right?

844
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:20,279
You're right. It will benefit me.

845
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:21,760
But you'll get something
out of this too.

846
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,880
If during this one year,
we don't fight with each other

847
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,399
and live in peace,

848
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:30,039
we won't have any
extramarital issues.

849
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,239
I don't think that will be an issue.

850
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:42,529
That's true.

851
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,880
You came first,
so I will let you be number one.

852
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:48,319
Let's live in peace.

853
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:52,609
When I fight with him,
I'll have you as my adviser.

854
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,680
You should know him best.

855
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:03,960
Interesting.

856
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:20,079
It's a deal.

857
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,609
We're friends now.

858
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:26,720
You can talk to me about anything.

859
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,800
You can ask my advice
about anything.

860
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:31,399
Really?

861
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,840
Really.

862
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,239
We're friends now.
You can always talk to me.

863
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,609
And I will listen.

864
01:10:01,609 --> 01:10:02,609
Lan.

865
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:15,159
I'm glad you agreed to meet me.

866
01:10:28,609 --> 01:10:30,479
- You should try this.
- Get to the point.

867
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:32,479
I don't have much time for you.

868
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:43,920
When we broke up,
I was young and passionate.

869
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,529
I didn't trust you.

870
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,159
I was angry at Praomook,
but I took it out on you.

871
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:49,880
I was wrong.

872
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,039
It's behind us now.

873
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:55,529
I don't even remember what happened.

874
01:10:56,039 --> 01:10:59,239
I remember everything between us.

875
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:04,039
I searched for you
until I found you.

876
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:12,319
Please, Lan. Can we start over?

877
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,119
Alright. We'll start over

878
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,479
as friends.

879
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,960
We can't be more than that
because I have Rut.

880
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:32,569
Are you two really lovers?

881
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,529
I thought you lied about it
to avoid marrying her.

882
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:39,439
It's the truth. I'm dating him.

883
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:42,720
About the marriage,
I can't avoid it anyway.

884
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,920
Did you turn gay

885
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
because of me?

886
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,840
If that is the case,
I'd feel bad about it.

887
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:53,960
You don't have to feel anything.

888
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:56,359
My preference
has nothing to do with you.

889
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:08,529
It's unfortunate.

890
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,079
Had I put up with Praomook more,

891
01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:15,039
we wouldn't have become strangers.

892
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,960
Lan,

893
01:12:26,649 --> 01:12:31,079
if you don't want to marry her,
you can ask for my help.

894
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,279
I can deal with it on my own.

895
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,920
Alright.
Tell me if you need my help.

896
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Here.

897
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,920
The brand owner wired us money.
They will send us a new collection.

898
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:36,840
Okay. Thank you.

899
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:42,159
Tell me what happened.
Can dress fitting dehydrate you?

900
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:47,079
Has a woman ever turned you on?

901
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:49,720
Why are you asking me that?

902
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,279
I tried to seduce Lan
to drive him crazy.

903
01:13:53,479 --> 01:13:55,840
And he was clearly into it.

904
01:13:57,079 --> 01:13:59,079
Lan and I are different.

905
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,199
I used my gaydar on Lan and Rut.
It didn't ping.

906
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,039
Right. That's why I was
trying to prove

907
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,760
if he was gay or not.

908
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:09,649
Answer the question first.

909
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,399
This is up to
each person's preference.

910
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:17,199
I like men,
only men can make me feel things.

911
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:20,159
With you, I don't feel anything.

912
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:23,359
Even if you tried to seduce me,
I wouldn't feel a thing.

913
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:29,760
Is it possible that Lan is bisexual?

914
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:31,609
It's possible.

915
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,039
But the way he came on to you in
Korea showed his sexual preference.

916
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,649
I think he is straight and created
the story to fool everyone.

917
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,399
However, just to be sure,

918
01:14:44,119 --> 01:14:46,760
I can prove it for you.
They are both delightful.

919
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,800
Try it if you get a chance.
I'm curious about it too.

920
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,569
You've got it.

921
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:58,359
Be sure not to test him on a whim.
Or you might start feeling things.

922
01:14:58,569 --> 01:15:01,840
And when you start feeling things,
you might get hooked.

923
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,479
Then it will be too late
to back out.

924
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:06,680
Silly. I won't feel anything.

925
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,279
I won't get ahead of myself.

926
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,119
Saying it is one thing,
doing it is a different story.

927
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:14,720
Lan is your first and only love.

928
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,649
He is the reason why
you've been single all this time.

929
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,960
Who said that?
I just haven't found the right man.

930
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,319
You haven't found the right man?

931
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,880
Or you haven't forgotten
the first man you ever loved?

932
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,239
I told you. I don't love him.

933
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,439
You keep saying that,
but does your heart really think so?

934
01:15:38,279 --> 01:15:40,569
Remember, Mook.
Don't use your heart to play.

935
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,720
Because eventually, you will be
the one who gets hurt.

936
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:47,319
In this game, the first one
who falls in love loses.

937
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,569
He will be the loser, not me.

938
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,840
Duckling.

939
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,880
I will never love you.

940
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,279
I hate you.

941
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,960
Even if you were the only person
left in the world,

942
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,000
I'd rather be single
for the rest of my life.

943
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:28,159
You love me.

944
01:16:28,529 --> 01:16:30,079
Admit that you love me.

945
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:34,199
You love me.

946
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,279
I don't love you.

947
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,840
Mook.

948
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:51,680
You're strong.

949
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,119
Guys, if you need my help,
let me know.

950
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,199
I'll do my best.

951
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:11,159
Could you proofread this

952
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:13,159
and summarize what happened at
the meeting by noon?

953
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,239
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

954
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,079
Review this game and note
its strengths and weaknesses.

955
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,119
- Get it done by today.
- Okay.

956
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,399
Summarize user comments
and make a presentation.

957
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,239
Can you handle it?

958
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:39,649
If you can't,
you don't have to do all the work.

959
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,159
I'll ask someone to help you.

960
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:44,479
This is nothing. I can handle it.

961
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:52,119
Aek, it's done.

962
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:02,199
Okay. Give this to Boss' assistant
so that Boss can approve it.

963
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,079
Make sure to get it back
in the evening.

964
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:05,920
Got it.

965
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:14,279
Hey, Poom.

966
01:19:17,529 --> 01:19:21,649
If you're asking about Boss,
I'm afraid that he is away.

967
01:19:23,569 --> 01:19:27,319
I'm not asking about him.
I'm delivering this to you.

968
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:38,760
When will Boss come to the office?

969
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:47,880
- I won't tell you.
- Come on, Poom

970
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:50,800
I'm warning you.

971
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,439
He gave you a chance,
so try not to ruin it.

972
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,439
If you want to fangirl over him,
do it outside of work hours.

973
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,439
When he is working, Boss is
a mean, serious, and headstrong man.

974
01:20:10,279 --> 01:20:12,609
If somebody displeases him,
he cuts their pay.

975
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,880
If somebody displeases him,
he threatens to fire them.

976
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:20,239
Sometimes he gets on my nerves
and I want to quit.

977
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,840
Why don't you write your
resignation letter? I'll sign it.

978
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:34,800
Here are the documents
requiring your signature.

979
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:40,760
Is this your first day here?

980
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,880
Yes.

981
01:20:43,479 --> 01:20:46,199
Why are you standing here
and not working?

982
01:20:46,609 --> 01:20:48,800
Do you want to quit too?

983
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,720
No, I don't.

984
01:20:51,319 --> 01:20:52,680
I'll get back to work.

985
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:47,239
Why does he always
have a mean look on his face?

986
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,680
He is so cool.

987
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:09,079
What?

988
01:22:10,039 --> 01:22:12,800
Your resignation letter.
Give it to me so I can sign it.

989
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:19,399
Here are the reports on the new
part-time and full-time employees

990
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:23,529
that you asked each department head
to make. They're all here.

991
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,800
About the video from
the rescue vehicle's camera,

992
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,079
did you find anything?

993
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,479
I found nothing.

994
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,399
It's fine. Get back to work.

995
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:49,649
Okay.

996
01:23:04,119 --> 01:23:07,079
You look like a good man.
I don't want to be your enemy.

997
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,680
Let's live in peace.

998
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,039
When I have a fight with him,
I'll have you as my adviser.

999
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:17,649
It's a deal.

1000
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:21,199
We're friends now.

1001
01:23:28,359 --> 01:23:32,569
Fine. If I want to be more, I have
to start with being her friend.

1002
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:00,680
Hello.

1003
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,039
It's me, Laknara.

1004
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,119
Lak.

1005
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,479
What can I do for you?

1006
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,279
I want to talk to you.

1007
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Alright.

1008
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:18,319
Take it.

1009
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,399
(Check)

1010
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,880
Why are you giving this to me?

1011
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:32,119
You can have that money
in exchange for Lan's freedom.

1012
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,880
Cancel the wedding.

1013
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,439
I have to decline your offer.

1014
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,439
I will triple the offer.

1015
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,609
In return,
you get out of Lan's life.

1016
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,159
I acknowledge what you are saying.

1017
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,039
But I won't cancel the wedding.

1018
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,960
I guess you think that
you'll make more from my father.

1019
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:06,609
Make your choice.
Get it now or get nothing at all.

1020
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:08,800
It's not like that.

1021
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:12,239
I'm marrying your brother
for your parents' sake.

1022
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:15,569
I don't want your money.

1023
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:17,569
Are you

1024
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,159
hoping that he will fall for you?

1025
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,680
This is based on superstition.
Stop clinging to hope.

1026
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,279
If he liked you, he wouldn't try
so hard to get you out of his life.

1027
01:25:34,439 --> 01:25:35,720
Thanks for telling me.

1028
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:41,399
Whatever reasons you have for
this marriage, remember my words.

1029
01:25:42,119 --> 01:25:45,079
Don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you,

1030
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:47,760
be it fame, wealth, or love.

1031
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:50,319
Otherwise, you will be unhappy
for the rest of your life.

1032
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,880
If you change your mind,
cash that check.

1033
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:58,000
Or just let me know
if you want more.

1034
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:00,920
The offer is still on the table.

1035
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:42,760
(One hundred million baht)

1036
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,199
I may need money,
but I'm not a greedy person.

1037
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,720
Don't use me and Mom as excuses.

1038
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,960
You're doing this for yourself.
You're selfish.

1039
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:02,399
Alright. I'm selfish.

1040
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,239
I don't care how he feels
or if he has a lover.

1041
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:07,239
I only care about my own interests.

1042
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:08,920
I'm a bad person. Are you happy?

1043
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:12,399
I will be happy
only if you cancel the wedding.

1044
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,359
Praomook, you have a beautiful name,

1045
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,000
but you're behaving like
a worthless, despicable person.

1046
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,399
It's almost 09:09 a.m.
and Lan hasn't shown up.

1047
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,520
If he doesn't show up,
you won't get the house back, right?

1048
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,359
- Hello.
- Lan, help me.

1049
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,560
What's wrong?
