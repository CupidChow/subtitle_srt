1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,719
(Praomook)

3
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Chalantorn,

4
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,159
your fire element is weak,
making you prone to illness.

5
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
You must marry

6
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,319
a woman born on the 15th day
of the 4th waxing moon.

7
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,800
You will complement each other,

8
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,080
strengthening your elements.

9
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Chalantorn!

10
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,759
I love you!

11
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,240
I know you love me too.

12
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,560
Be my boyfriend.

13
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,319
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
What's gotten into you?

15
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,879
Who would love you?

16
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,050
Even if you were
the only girl in the world,

17
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,879
I would never choose you.

18
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,800
Hey, everybody.

19
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Hi.

20
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,279
She is Thai.

21
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,839
- Everyone, say hey.
- Hey.

22
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,160
Are you ready?

23
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:51,560
One, two, three, let's go!

24
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,279
Thank you.

25
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,800
Bye-bye.

26
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,439
Hi.

27
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,959
Good luck.

28
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,279
Good job.

29
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
Hey.

30
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,439
Are you ready?

31
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,199
Thank you.

32
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,920
Have we met before?

33
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,920
That line is getting old.

34
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,480
I like you.

35
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,439
Don't you think
it's too fast to say that

36
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,399
on the first day we met?

37
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,000
I think it's fine.

38
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,519
We have the entire night
to get to know each other.

39
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,639
But I don't like you.

40
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,679
Help!

41
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,559
He is a pervert.

42
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,330
He is harassing me.
He touched my chest.

43
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,039
Help me!

44
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,279
- Help!
- Lan, what are you doing? Run.

45
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Come on.

46
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,559
Guards!

47
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Hurry.

48
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,450
Did they hurt you?

49
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,919
Do you really think
they could do anything to me?

50
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,879
So they didn't hurt you, did they?

51
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,330
You're bad.

52
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,279
If I see that DJ again,
I'll make her pay for this.

53
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,399
Do you still want to see her again?
Have you learned nothing?

54
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,279
Why do I have to learn anything?
I don't want to see her again.

55
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,960
So you don't want anything
to do with her, right?

56
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I don't.

57
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,720
Why do you ask?

58
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,720
First route, turn left
and continue ahead for 25 meters.

59
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,639
The distance is about 230 meters.
There will be a group of people.

60
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,679
Second route,
continue ahead for 70 meters.

61
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,600
The distance is about 490 meters.

62
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,960
Survival rate is 91.9 percent.
Success.

63
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,799
We have to split.

64
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,840
I will lead them away.
Meet me at the hotel.

65
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Alright.

66
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,120
There!

67
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,200
Isn't this a nice spot?

68
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,399
Sure.

69
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,039
Hey, there's a show over there.
Do you want to watch it?

70
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,159
Sure.

71
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,960
Lan.

72
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,279
Forget him.

73
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,279
This is a blind spot.

74
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,080
Oh, my.

75
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,119
From now on I will take care of you.

76
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,000
Lan! I've come to the rescue.

77
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:36,170
No, duckling, put me down.
I'm playing soccer.

78
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,599
No, you're hurt. You need to rest.
I can't let you get sick.

79
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,119
I'm healthy now.

80
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,559
Your injury. Where's your injury?

81
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,359
There's no injury.
You wouldn't listen.

82
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,720
You duckling.

83
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,559
Ow, that hurt!

84
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,720
Can you stop calling me duckling?

85
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,170
No way. You're an ugly duckling.

86
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,720
Very ugly and annoying.

87
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,839
How dare you say that
about your wife!

88
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,759
A wife based on superstition
doesn't count.

89
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,799
Don't come back to me
when you run into bad luck.

90
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,410
Is he gone?

91
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,359
He's gone.

92
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,720
Let me see your wound.

93
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,000
Sit down carefully.

94
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,720
It isn't deep. You should be fine.

95
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,410
I'll go then.

96
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,279
Wait.

97
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,559
This is your doing, isn't it?

98
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
What are you talking about?

99
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,480
You ordered an attack on me.

100
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,319
Hey, don't point a finger at me.

101
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,519
I didn't order anything.

102
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,240
You're lying.
You ordered them to shoot me.

103
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,920
You're behind this attack.

104
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,559
You're so cruel.

105
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,079
You're going to pay for this.
Come with me.

106
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,480
Hey, let go of me.

107
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,920
Listen to me.
I told you I wasn't involved.

108
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,200
Let go.

109
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,170
Ouch!

110
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:24,240
That's what happens
when you don't listen.

111
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,599
- Hey...
- Shut it.

112
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,440
And listen to me.

113
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,039
I didn't order anyone to attack you.

114
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,440
Alright. I believe that
you didn't order the attack.

115
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,359
- There you go.
- Instead, you created a situation

116
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,960
and came to my rescue like a hero

117
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,799
so that I would be impressed by you
because you like me.

118
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,000
Tell me what you want.

119
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,519
- I like you?
- Yes.

120
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
Who do you think you are?
You're obviously full of yourself.

121
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,759
I don't fancy you enough
to risk my life like that.

122
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,000
If he's not working for you,
who is he working for then?

123
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,319
How would I know?

124
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,880
Maybe you were behaving like a
pervert and they wanted to hurt you.

125
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,720
Instead of blaming me,

126
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,519
you should thank me
for risking my life for you.

127
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,359
You owe me.

128
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,680
What do you want in return?

129
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
Money.

130
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,039
Or me.

131
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,160
I don't want anything from you,
except for a thank you.

132
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,400
Is that all?

133
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
That's all.

134
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,880
But I want to give you
more than that.

135
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,480
I know you like it.

136
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,039
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
standing still like this.

137
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,519
Don't deny it.

138
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,920
I don't want what you're offering.

139
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,160
If you don't stop sexually harassing
me, I will make you go extinct.

140
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,000
You!

141
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,880
Try me. I mean it.

142
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:18,799
Hey, hey.

143
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,960
Hey, what happened to you?

144
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
I was shot.

145
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,039
You were shot?

146
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,799
Let me see your wound.

147
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,799
The bleeding has stopped.
It's just a scratch.

148
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,960
The wound isn't deep.

149
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,759
Tell me what happened.

150
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,119
I'll tell you later.
Take me to get cleaned up first.

151
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,319
Alright, let's go.

152
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Oak.

153
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
Mook, where were you?

154
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,960
What's that on your coat?

155
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,519
It's red.

156
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,559
- Don't tell me.
- It's blood.

157
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,839
- Are you hurt?
- Hey, hey.

158
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,480
Do you want to go to the hospital?

159
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm fine. It's not my blood.

160
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,559
I just ran into a little trouble.

161
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
I don't think this is a little.

162
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,839
Tell me what happened.

163
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,920
Mook, aren't you afraid of dying?

164
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
I am.

165
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,039
Then why did you
put your life at risk?

166
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,519
You can call the police.

167
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,359
I don't know. Before I knew it,
I was already helping him.

168
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,000
Why did you help him?

169
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,720
Mook, you don't like that man,
but you still helped him.

170
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,880
I think there's more to it.

171
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,720
Chalantorn, I love you!

172
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,079
Who would love you?

173
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Even if you were
the only girl in the world,

174
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,920
I would never choose you.

175
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,279
Whoa, what a small world.

176
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,839
You didn't get the wrong guy, right?

177
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,400
Even though his small brain
doesn't recognize me,

178
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,920
I know it's him. I'm sure of it.

179
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,279
I guess you've been holding
a grudge against him.

180
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,960
That's right. I have.

181
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,680
That explains why
you were so mean to him.

182
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,400
Maybe fate has brought you
together again.

183
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,799
Nonsense. This isn't fate.

184
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,680
This is called bad fortune.

185
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,480
Mook, be honest with me.

186
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,960
Do you still love him?

187
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,799
I want you to realize

188
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
that I don't love you.

189
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,880
I've never loved you

190
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,519
and never will.

191
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,680
That's not true. You love me.

192
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,160
I've done everything for you.

193
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,920
You must love me.
You can't love anybody else.

194
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,359
Stop talking nonsense.

195
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,079
You're just an ugly duckling.

196
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,920
We got married because our parents
believe in that stupid superstition.

197
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,720
Keep this in mind.

198
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,599
I find you annoying.

199
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,920
If I had to get sick or die
instead of having you in my life,

200
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,079
I'd rather die

201
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,559
than have you ruin my life.

202
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,839
I've done everything for you.

203
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,920
I've put you before myself.

204
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,680
I care about you
more than my own life.

205
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,160
But you think I've annoyed you.

206
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
Fine. If you think others
are better than me, you can go.

207
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,680
I won't bother you again.

208
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
I will stay out of your life
forever.

209
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,640
Even if you don't
get out of my life,

210
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,279
I will stay away from you myself.

211
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,519
I don't want

212
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,440
a disgusting person like you.

213
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,440
No. Even if he was
the only man left in the world,

214
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,079
I would never want him.

215
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,839
You're lucky it isn't too bad.

216
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,240
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the police?

217
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,079
This isn't Thailand.
It would be too much trouble.

218
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,359
By the way,

219
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,759
did you see the shooter's face?

220
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,960
No, I didn't.

221
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,640
But I think it's one of
DJ Prao's guards or fans.

222
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,559
I don't think they would do that.

223
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,480
At worst they would beat you.

224
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,759
You don't know for sure.

225
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,359
She probably created the situation

226
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,799
so she could be the hero
and impress me.

227
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,640
She plays hard to get

228
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
when she clearly wants me.

229
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,599
You're such a narcissist.

230
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,200
That's too much effort.

231
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,119
If they made a mistake,
you could be dead.

232
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,839
Maybe she has an ulterior motive.

233
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,720
Or it could be someone else's
doing entirely.

234
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,440
Think about it. You might have
made enemies in the past.

235
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,440
I can think of...

236
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,400
no one.

237
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,599
There might be someone
you can't think of.

238
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,480
You're right. An unseen enemy.

239
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,559
But I refuse to be a sitting duck.

240
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,319
If they want you dead,

241
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,279
they won't stop here.

242
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,759
Fine then.

243
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,000
I'll catch them next time.

244
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,200
It's not that I care about you, Lan.

245
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,400
I just want to know how you are.

246
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:25,240
It's only a scratch.
He will be fine.

247
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,640
(Dad)

248
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,200
Hey, Dad. Do you miss me?

249
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,720
I miss you. When will you come home?

250
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,319
Well, it will be a while longer.

251
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,400
If I ask you to come home early,
will you do it for me?

252
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,440
Is something wrong?

253
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,319
Nothing's wrong.

254
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,799
I just want you to help me
with our company sooner.

255
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,400
We've talked about this, Dad.

256
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,240
I'm going to take a DJ course here
for a year after graduation.

257
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,240
And I'll work as a DJ for two years.

258
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,400
After that, I will come back
and work for you.

259
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,279
I've already contacted the school.

260
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,559
Why did you change your mind?

261
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,559
You don't have to quit this DJ job
for me. I don't mind it.

262
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,359
But can you push back
your studies by a year?

263
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,519
Something urgent came up
at the company.

264
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,000
I want you to help me
as soon as possible.

265
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,759
Is there something wrong?

266
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,960
There's the important project
that I think you could help me with.

267
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,640
But I want to try being a DJ first.

268
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,279
I don't want to
miss this opportunity.

269
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,680
Can you give me more time?

270
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,359
I think we should talk
about this later.

271
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,000
Alright, I'll come back
and talk to you.

272
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,200
Love you, Dad.

273
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,960
Do you feel better now?

274
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,240
If you're still stressed out,

275
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,599
your DJ paycheck will turn into
clothes and cosmetics.

276
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,400
I feel a little better.
My dad suddenly changed his mind.

277
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,839
You already know that
I have a goal in life.

278
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,519
It's why I worked as a DJ
when I was in school.

279
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,839
I wanted the experience.

280
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,839
I've already decided I'll be a DJ
and write music these two years.

281
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,799
I know that and I'm sure you know

282
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,720
that your dad wouldn't ask
this of you if it wasn't serious.

283
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,119
That's why I don't have
the heart to refuse him.

284
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,000
But it doesn't matter.
I'm going to follow my dream anyway.

285
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,960
I'll make him understand.

286
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,720
You're really stubborn.

287
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,720
Everything has to
go your way, right?

288
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,319
Yes.

289
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,200
Don't worry. Whatever you do,
I always have your back.

290
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,759
You're the best.

291
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,359
Don't leave me, alright?

292
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Alright.

293
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,840
Tonight I will look for leads
at the club,

294
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,920
in case I can find out
who the shooter is.

295
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,719
- Wait for me at the hotel.
- I'll go with you.

296
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,329
I don't think so.
It's too dangerous.

297
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,400
If they're still around,
they will try to hurt you.

298
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm not scared of them.

299
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:28,769
I can deal with them
if they show up.

300
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:32,289
I also want to
confirm my suspicions.

301
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,559
What is it?

302
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,840
DJ Prao.

303
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,159
If she is behind
everything that happened,

304
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,519
she will act strange
when she sees me.

305
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,769
Are you sure it's about that?

306
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,079
Or is it that
you're interested in her?

307
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,769
It's her beauty that
interested me at first.

308
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,400
But what interests me now is that
she might be behind the attack.

309
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,360
I want to investigate this myself.

310
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,329
I can't stop you, can I?

311
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
No, you can't.

312
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,400
Just be careful.

313
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:13,639
Hey, I have you, man.
I'm not scared of anything.

314
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:15,289
Whatever.

315
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:28,119
- Let's check out those earrings.
- Let's go.

316
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,480
Hey, Mom.

317
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:48,840
What?

318
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Okay.

319
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
What's wrong, Mook?

320
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,329
I have to go back to
Thailand immediately.

321
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Hold on.

322
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,880
- Wait for me.
- Hurry up.

323
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,000
Lan, where are you going?

324
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:44,840
What's going on?

325
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,840
I saw that bratty DJ,

326
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,480
but I lost her.

327
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,400
Mom, Petch, how is Dad?

328
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,960
I don't know.
He is still in surgery.

329
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,239
Mook, what took you so long?

330
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,480
Do you know what we've gone through?

331
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,599
I got the earliest ticket.

332
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,329
What's going on here, Petch?

333
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,559
Dad fell and knocked
his head on the ground.

334
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,119
The doctor said he had a stroke.

335
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:54,289
Mook, will Dad be okay?

336
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,519
Mook.

337
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,079
Dad will be okay, Petch.
He will be okay.

338
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,440
The patient has multiple
hemorrhages in the brain.

339
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:12,239
I tried to remove the clot
from a major artery.

340
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,329
However, his brain has suffered
oxygen deprivation for a long time,

341
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,119
resulting in brain damage.

342
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,679
What does that mean?

343
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:24,480
It means although we've stopped
the bleeding, he may not recover.

344
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,289
Worst case scenario,
it may result in brain death.

345
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,039
Brain death.

346
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,639
Are you saying that

347
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,639
- he may not wake up again?
- That's correct.

348
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,480
He can't breathe on his own
and has to be on life support.

349
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,329
If we take him off of life support,
he can leave us anytime.

350
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,559
Doctor, you have to help my dad.
He has to be okay.

351
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,639
- You have to help him.
- Petch, no.

352
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,440
The doctor tried his best.

353
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,840
Excuse me.

354
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,599
Doctor.

355
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
- Doctor.
- No, Petch.

356
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,679
Mom.

357
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,519
Why is this happening?

358
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,920
No.

359
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,480
No, this isn't happening.

360
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,079
Dad, you have to stay strong.

361
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,119
I won't give up.

362
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,719
I will do everything I can
to get you to come back.

363
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,159
Hang in there, Dad.

364
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,599
Don't leave us.

365
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,289
Dad, stay with me.

366
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,159
I love you.

367
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,329
Dear,

368
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:23,480
we will be right beside you.

369
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:59,239
The guards here don't carry guns.

370
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,199
Your shooter isn't
one of these guards.

371
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,289
So we don't know who did it.

372
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,119
What are you going to do next?

373
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
Let's talk about it
when we're back in Bangkok.

374
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,559
Okay.

375
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,400
We will meet again someday.

376
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:14,840
Mom,

377
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,239
you haven't eaten much.
You don't want to pass out.

378
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,960
I don't have an appetite.
It's all overwhelming.

379
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,039
I have no idea what to do next.

380
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:30,239
Mom,

381
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,119
don't worry.

382
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,199
While Dad is recovering,
I'll run the company and the stores.

383
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,159
We'll get through this together.

384
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,679
Ma'am, ma'am.

385
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,880
I've got bad news.

386
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Here.

387
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,480
It's a court order.

388
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,880
Seizure of property.

389
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,840
What is this?

390
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,920
Are we being evicted from our house?

391
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,159
This has to be a prank.

392
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:23,719
Where are we going to go?

393
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,639
Do we really have to leave?

394
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,199
- This can't be happening.
- Take it easy. I'll handle this.

395
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:39,639
Lawyer, I need to talk to you.

396
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,800
According to Pethai's debt document

397
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,920
and the agreement with this house
as collateral for the loan,

398
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,480
he has debts totaling about
100 million baht.

399
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,599
- A hundred million?
- A hundred million?

400
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,840
Why is he so heavily in debt?

401
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,880
The company's liquidity hasn't been
good for the last three years.

402
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,719
He had to take out a loan
from the bank

403
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,639
and used this house as collateral.

404
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,119
But he couldn't solve the problems.

405
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,719
He has fallen behind
on the payments for some time.

406
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,360
How is the company?

407
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,320
He sold the company and all the
stores before he was hospitalized,

408
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:27,440
but it wasn't enough
to clear his debts.

409
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,760
Oh dear. He's been
keeping this to himself.

410
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,400
Something urgent came up
at the company.

411
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,119
I want you to help me
as soon as possible.

412
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,280
He called me
because he needed my help.

413
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,639
If I came back sooner,
he wouldn't be in this condition.

414
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:58,880
Mook, don't blame yourself.

415
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,159
We have nothing now, do we?

416
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm afraid so.

417
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,079
But we can still try to reconcile
before the asset sale.

418
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,320
If you can pay the interest,
you will have three more months.

419
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,400
This house is worth
about 50 million.

420
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,960
Fifty million.

421
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,679
This isn't happening.

422
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,199
Mom, are we going to go bankrupt?

423
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,320
This isn't happening.
How is this possible?

424
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,280
We don't even know
if that document is real.

425
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,920
Petch, calm down.
Crying isn't going to help anything.

426
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,960
Whatever is happening,
we have to accept it.

427
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,840
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear the truth.

428
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
This isn't true. It isn't happening.
The document isn't real.

429
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:44,079
Petch!

430
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,719
- Petch!
- Mook.

431
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,400
Give her time.

432
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,639
Mom, don't worry.

433
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,320
I will find a way to pay his debts.
We won't lose this house.

434
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,159
We will get through this together.

435
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,599
Is this what coming back
from a business trip looks like?

436
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,079
You look like
you just got into a fight.

437
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,119
Look, if you want to take a trip,
tell me. You didn't have to lie.

438
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,360
I didn't lie to you.
I went there for work.

439
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,639
I don't care
if you don't believe me.

440
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:14,760
I don't believe you,

441
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,079
since the moment
I saw these cuts on your face.

442
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,199
I spent millions
on your education abroad,

443
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,400
hoping that you would
help me run the company.

444
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,599
But look at you, fooling around
and doing nothing useful.

445
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,639
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

446
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,920
I know what I'm doing.

447
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,639
So you know you're being useless.

448
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,480
Good thing you still have a brain.

449
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,480
It's the brain you gave me.

450
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:44,719
Hey,

451
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,639
is that an insult?

452
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,000
Dear,

453
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,360
why are you scolding your son?

454
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,679
Dear,

455
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,960
didn't you hear
what he just said to me?

456
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,400
He said the brain
I gave him is useless.

457
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:01,559
I didn't hear it.

458
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,559
I only heard you telling him off.

459
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,000
What's going on? Explain it to me.

460
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,800
Well, I didn't tell him off.

461
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,400
I complimented him,
that he has a good brain.

462
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,559
That he thinks about things that
he shouldn't be thinking about.

463
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:17,360
That he doesn't think about
what he should be thinking about.

464
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,760
Dear, stop finding fault with him.

465
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,960
He just graduated.
He needs time to adjust.

466
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,719
He is useless because
you keep spoiling him.

467
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,400
Are you saying
I'm not a good mother?

468
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:31,519
This is getting out of control.

469
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:34,119
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm criticizing him.

470
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,559
I'm criticizing him, not you.

471
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,039
I can't believe you.

472
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,719
What's the point of complaining?

473
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,400
Give him time. When he is ready,
he will work at the company.

474
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:49,599
It's not going to happen
in my lifetime.

475
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,280
I guess so. Can you wait for me?

476
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,039
Lan!

477
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,239
You caused chaos
the moment you came back.

478
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,400
I didn't start it.

479
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:02,360
If you behaved well, would he
be complaining about you?

480
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,440
Alright. It's always my fault.

481
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:08,079
I'm always a good-for-nothing
in your and Dad's eyes.

482
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,639
You believe only what
you want to believe.

483
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,840
When I try to explain myself,
you think I'm arguing with you.

484
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:19,000
If you were me, I know
you wouldn't take his criticism.

485
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:20,840
Don't compare me to you.

486
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,239
If you don't want Dad and me
believing you're a good-for-nothing,

487
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,800
prove yourself.
Show that you're reliable.

488
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:31,960
Words aren't enough.

489
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:36,079
You don't like being compared.
Neither do I.

490
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,159
As for trying to prove myself,
I've been doing it already.

491
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:45,239
If you aren't blind,
you should be able to see it.

492
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,039
If you want me to see it,
go to work at the company.

493
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,320
I have a position for you.

494
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,599
Don't be useless like this.

495
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,400
I'm not doing it.

496
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:00,400
You have to do it
because this is an order.

497
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,800
Let's calm down.

498
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,320
Lan just came back. We should
let him rest. Right, Mom?

499
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,360
Danai is right.

500
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,559
Lan, why don't you go clean up
and have something to eat?

501
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,199
I'll tell Ja to prepare
your favorite food.

502
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,840
About other things,

503
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:23,239
let's forget them for now.

504
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,559
I haven't finished talking.

505
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,880
You've finished.

506
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,880
Come on, Lan. Go clean up.

507
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,800
Wait, why are you burning up?
What's wrong?

508
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,400
I'm fine.

509
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:39,719
Are you sure?

510
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,239
- Ow!
- Oh, what's the matter?

511
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,760
Hold on.

512
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,480
Do you have a cut on your arm too?

513
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,440
She can't even touch it. Let me see.

514
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,480
- What's wrong? Let me see.
- Come here.

515
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:53,679
Wait.

516
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Lan.

517
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Lan.

518
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:07,199
- Lan!
- Hey, Lan!

519
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:08,559
Lan!

520
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,119
- Lan!
- Lan!

521
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,079
What's wrong?

522
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,559
Hey, wake up.

523
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,760
Mook,

524
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,079
I have something for you.

525
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,719
I think selling all of this will
only get us a few hundred grand.

526
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,159
Hello, Oak.

527
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,320
Book me for every day this week.

528
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,840
From seven to two. At any place.

529
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,679
I'll accept product reviewing too.

530
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,960
I'll tell you about it later.

531
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,079
Thanks.

532
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,519
Mook,

533
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,280
will you be able to endure all that?

534
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
Of course I will.

535
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,920
I have to, even if it gets
harder than this.

536
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,519
Boss, everything is ready.

537
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,519
- Poom.
- Yes, Boss?

538
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,400
Find out everything you can about
DJ Prao. I sent you her picture.

539
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:21,840
Do you want her work
or personal information?

540
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Everything.

541
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,119
You must have
a special interest in her.

542
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:28,400
Have you fixed things
with your girls yet?

543
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,199
You don't want to
get yourself into trouble.

544
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,039
If I still see you in one minute,

545
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:37,159
- I'm going to fire...
- See you at the event, Boss.

546
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:14,679
Dad,

547
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,440
hang in there.

548
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,840
Aren't you going to
Mars' launch event?

549
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,760
I'm busy. Mom won't let me go.

550
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,840
I can't go.
Something happened to my family.

551
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:00,719
Petch.

552
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,760
I told you to pack unnecessary items
to sell. Why aren't you doing it?

553
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,159
I asked you a question.

554
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,519
Alright.

555
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:17,719
Ting, pack it all up, and sell it.

556
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,079
Okay.

557
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,800
You can't take this.

558
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:26,280
You can't take that either.

559
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,599
Don't touch my stuff.

560
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:37,719
I have to do this.

561
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:39,840
You know we have to
get this house back.

562
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,559
We have to sell everything
that we don't need.

563
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,159
But those are important to me.

564
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,599
I paid a lot to get them.

565
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
You paid a lot?

566
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,760
How much?

567
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:54,360
Ting, pack everything.

568
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,559
Mook, they are precious to me.
I can't let you sell them.

569
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:02,199
Don't you understand our situation?
Nothing is the same anymore.

570
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,920
We have to clear our debts.

571
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,880
You can get these things back later.

572
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,039
You don't understand.

573
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,079
There's only a small number of them.
You can't buy them back.

574
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,719
To you, they are unnecessary.

575
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,440
To me, they are my friends, my life.

576
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:17,280
Are they more important
than our lives?

577
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,679
If tomorrow we don't have a house
or a meal, can they help you?

578
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,719
But we still have this house today.

579
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,440
And we're not starving.
There's food in the fridge.

580
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,079
I'm not selling them no matter what.

581
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,119
Why are you so selfish?

582
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:31,400
I'm not selfish.

583
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:33,960
It's you who's being selfish.
You don't care about me at all.

584
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,400
These things are just like
your stupid DJ equipment.

585
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:38,119
It makes you happy.

586
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,280
In my case, these aren't different
from your DJ equipment at all.

587
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:43,960
They aren't the same, Petch.

588
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:47,280
That stupid DJ equipment
helps me make money.

589
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,199
What can your collectibles do?

590
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,920
You wouldn't understand
if I told you.

591
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:53,639
You're right. I wouldn't.

592
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,960
What I do understand is that
I have to save this house

593
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,440
for when Dad comes back.

594
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,400
Because this is the most
precious thing our family owns.

595
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:04,559
But if you think this house means
nothing to you, fine.

596
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:06,039
I understand.

597
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:09,760
But have you ever understood
Mom or me? Ask yourself that.

598
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,880
Your daughters and I
know everything now.

599
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,320
And I know you've tried your best.

600
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,719
Don't blame yourself.

601
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,840
We're in this together.

602
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,320
I'll keep our house.

603
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,119
We'll go back there together.

604
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,719
- Did you buy this for me?
- I did.

605
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,039
- Did you design this room for me?
- I did.

606
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,920
It's your reward for getting into
a university. I gave you my word.

607
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,639
I'm so happy, Dad. Give me a hug.

608
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,760
- Thank you, Dad.
- No problem.

609
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:51,760
I'm not selfish.

610
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,800
It's you who's being selfish.
You don't care about me at all.

611
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,280
These things are just like
your stupid DJ equipment.

612
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,039
It makes you happy.

613
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,239
In my case, these aren't different
from your DJ equipment at all.

614
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,639
Mook.

615
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,679
Ting.

616
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Could you help me pack
these things to sell?

617
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,239
Don't do it, Mook.

618
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:22,840
I have to do this.
I don't want to be a selfish person.

619
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,800
You're not selfish.

620
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:27,519
This helps you make money.

621
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:30,840
One day you might take this to work.

622
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
You could also rent it to somebody.

623
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,960
You're right.

624
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,159
I was being impulsive.

625
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:49,480
Mook, listen.

626
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:52,119
Give your sister time.

627
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,360
Once she settles down,

628
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:56,840
I'm sure she will help her family.

629
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,960
I hope so.

630
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,440
He was shot?

631
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,320
Give it to me.

632
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:14,360
- Who shot him?
- I don't know.

633
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,679
But I think they got the wrong guy.

634
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,599
They got the wrong guy?
Lan is burning up here.

635
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,119
What kind of friend are you?
Why don't you look out for him?

636
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,119
Is he alright?

637
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:28,159
The doctor said he has an infection
and a high fever.

638
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,920
He hasn't had enough sleep.

639
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:33,400
From the looks of it, it might
take him a while to recover.

640
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,119
Okay.

641
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,519
Oh, Lan.

642
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,320
Look at what you did to yourself.

643
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,320
You're lucky you are still alive.

644
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,320
Don't curse him.

645
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:54,679
Maybe Marut is right.
They got the wrong guy.

646
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,880
Although he is irresponsible,
he isn't a rowdy person.

647
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:00,920
You always make excuses for him.

648
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,519
It's too bad this happened
in another country.

649
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,800
If it happened here,

650
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,960
I would catch the shooter and
hand him to the police myself.

651
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,960
Oh, Lan.

652
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,519
Why are you so unlucky?

653
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:22,679
Dear, will he be okay? I'm scared.

654
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,039
Hang in there.
You have to get through tonight.

655
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,320
You will get better.

656
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,519
Stay strong, Lan.

657
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,199
I will do everything

658
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:47,679
to get you back on your feet.

659
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:49,239
Trust me.

660
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:51,360
Get well soon, my foolish brother.

661
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,480
You always worry me.

662
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,400
Take it easy, dear.

663
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,440
A stubborn man like him
will be fine.

664
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,360
That's right, Mom.

665
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,400
The doctor said he'll get better
in a couple of days.

666
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:14,960
This time he brought it on himself.

667
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,960
Come on, Lak. It kills me
to see my kid get hurt.

668
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,599
This is a mess.

669
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,239
You just came back from
a meeting in Hong Kong

670
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:37,000
and you've been working nonstop.
Instead of taking a rest,

671
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,679
you had to deal with Lan
and the hospital.

672
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,920
I'm happy to do it.

673
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:45,039
Lan is like a brother to me.

674
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,440
Good thing we've got you.
Otherwise, it'd be more chaotic.

675
01:03:51,719 --> 01:03:54,760
I can't believe him.
When will he finally grow up?

676
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,599
Men are like that.
They love their freedom.

677
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,079
They only live day by day.

678
01:04:01,239 --> 01:04:02,679
You're not like that.

679
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,000
You're responsible and diligent.

680
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,639
Unlike you, he is a deadweight.

681
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,559
Because I love
a smart woman like you.

682
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:17,840
If I behaved like a loser,

683
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:20,199
a perfect woman like you
wouldn't choose me.

684
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,519
Sweet talker.

685
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,679
You're a good man.

686
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,480
I'm lucky I get to marry you.

687
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,079
You're why my life is perfect.

688
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:43,519
Let's go.

689
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,880
Dear, I'm scared.

690
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:59,039
I'm scared his condition will get
worse like what happened before.

691
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,039
Calm down, dear.

692
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:04,920
Let me think.

693
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,320
Chalantorn,
your fire element is weak,

694
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,360
making you prone to illness.

695
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,239
You must marry

696
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,559
a woman born on the 15th day
of the 4th waxing moon.

697
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:25,280
You will complement each other,
strengthening your elements.

698
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,119
Oh.

699
01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:31,920
I have an idea.

700
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:33,519
We need to ask someone to help us.

701
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:34,639
Who?

702
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,039
Who do you think has
the element that complements him?

703
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:44,920
Oh, right.

704
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,440
But it's been so long. Will it help?

705
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,360
I think we should consult an expert

706
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,320
in case they can give us a solution.

707
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,599
But to consult an expert,

708
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,480
we need to make an appointment.
And who knows when that will be.

709
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:01,199
Right.

710
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,360
Alright, I have an idea.
Let's do it my way.

711
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,480
Here.

712
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:12,280
What is it?

713
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,679
Although she isn't here,
we can use her picture.

714
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,119
If her luck is strong,
she should be able to help him.

715
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,079
Wow.

716
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:24,199
Do you carry her picture around?

717
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
Yes, I do.

718
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,400
She turned things around for him,
making him recover.

719
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,880
So I keep this with me
for reassurance.

720
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:37,880
Please, help my son.

721
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,440
Dear.

722
01:06:54,199 --> 01:06:56,000
Presto!

723
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,519
Get well soon, my son.

724
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,320
Are you saying that
he may not wake up again?

725
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,840
He can't breathe on his own
and has to be on life support.

726
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,840
If we take off life support,
he can leave us anytime.

727
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,320
We have nothing now, do we?

728
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,280
But we can still try to reconcile
before the asset sale.

729
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,840
If you can pay the interest,
you will have three more months.

730
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:43,679
I have to save this house
for when Dad comes back.

731
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,360
Because this is the most
precious thing our family owns.

732
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,599
But if you think this house means
nothing to you, fine.

733
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:24,159
Hey!

734
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,479
You...

735
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:50,319
What drove me to become
successful at such a young age?

736
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:54,039
I wanted to establish myself.

737
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:56,359
I wanted to be able to stand on my
own two feet, doing what I love.

738
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:58,079
I love video games.

739
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,960
So I tried to make money
out of them.

740
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,479
I started by selling in-game items.

741
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,760
After I did that for a while,
I was able to gather some money.

742
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,960
My goal is to create my own games.

743
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,569
I'm passionate about my work.

744
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,399
My goal is clear.

745
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,720
I love video games.
I'm dedicated to video games.

746
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:19,079
I like winning.
I don't care how many times I fall.

747
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,920
I keep pushing until
I get what I want.

748
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:24,159
Until I have my own company,
Mars wiz.

749
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:29,920
Hey, hey.

750
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,439
Yes?

751
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,649
Are you hurt?

752
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:37,039
Okay.

753
01:09:49,569 --> 01:09:50,840
Be more careful.

754
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:54,239
What would've happened
if I didn't catch you in time?

755
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,359
I would've gotten hurt.
It's nothing.

756
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,000
That's right.
You would've gotten hurt badly.

757
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,960
The door could've crushed you,
breaking your bones,

758
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:14,119
suffocating you,
causing a punctured lung,

759
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,800
breaking your neck.

760
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,119
Do you still think it's nothing?

761
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:21,800
And not only
could you have hurt yourself,

762
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,840
you could've hurt other people too.

763
01:10:24,529 --> 01:10:26,920
Your carelessness
can get others in trouble.

764
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,399
You don't have to be mean about it.

765
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:33,760
I'm not being mean.
I'm stating the facts.

766
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:51,800
You don't have to be mean about it.

767
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,319
Stop crying.

768
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,920
I said stop crying.

769
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Hey.

770
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:06,479
Hey.

771
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Hey.

772
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:16,279
Boss.

773
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,920
Poom.

774
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:23,760
Excuse me.

775
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:25,960
Are you here for the launch event?

776
01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:29,680
There is a free in-game giveaway.
You should hurry up and get one.

777
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:41,439
Boss, what's going on?

778
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,399
You made a girl cry.

779
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:44,880
Did you hurt her?

780
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:48,279
Poom, it's not what you think.

781
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:51,039
I can't help it.
You were standing close together.

782
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:53,800
And look at your opened shirt.

783
01:11:54,649 --> 01:11:56,279
It isn't okay

784
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,039
to harass girls, Boss.

785
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:00,000
I didn't harass her.

786
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,159
If you don't stop accusing me.

787
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,319
Poom, do anything
to make her stop crying.

788
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,960
Boss, hold this.

789
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,920
Sign your name on
this limited edition model.

790
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:25,359
I will deal with her.

791
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:30,840
Is that a limited edition model?

792
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,960
Oh.

793
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,840
You've stopped crying.

794
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,680
I guess I don't have to
do anything now.

795
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:43,039
Good. She can just cry
whenever she wants.

796
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:44,319
What kind of kid is this?

797
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,840
Kid, I've got to
take my boss with me.

798
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:56,680
You can settle things with him
after the event.

799
01:12:57,569 --> 01:12:59,880
Boss, it's almost time.

800
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,840
You should get ready backstage
and change your shirt.

801
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,960
But I think you look sexy
in this one.

802
01:13:08,199 --> 01:13:09,199
Poom.

803
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:12,199
Let's enter the venue.
It's almost launch time.

804
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:16,920
Wait, hold on.

805
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,960
What do you want?

806
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,680
I like your games.

807
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,439
I've been a fan since
your first release up until now.

808
01:13:27,609 --> 01:13:29,359
I will play today's release too.

809
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:32,760
I've never missed
any of your events.

810
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
So?

811
01:13:34,529 --> 01:13:35,960
Can I have this?

812
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:42,680
Please, Marut.

813
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:47,960
I've entered all your giveaway
competitions, but I never won.

814
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:51,279
Please, let me have it.

815
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:52,960
Please, Marut.

816
01:13:53,569 --> 01:13:56,000
Please, Marut.

817
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:57,239
- Please.
- That won't work.

818
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:58,800
If you want it, you have to win.

819
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:00,880
Do you think
begging like this will work?

820
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:04,399
My boss has a heart of stone.

821
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,039
Please.

822
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:14,000
Come on, Marut. Please.

823
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:15,119
Poom.

824
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:21,649
Hand it to me.

825
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,960
Boss.

826
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,159
Can I also have your autograph?

827
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:39,119
Poom.

828
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:52,880
This is so great.

829
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:04,000
It is cute.

830
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,159
You're tricky.

831
01:15:19,479 --> 01:15:20,920
Thank you.

832
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,609
Let's go home.

833
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,479
I will take good care of you.

834
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:36,319
Oh.

835
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,960
A button.

836
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:47,399
Is this...

837
01:16:38,609 --> 01:16:39,609
Who are you?

838
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,800
Lan, it's me.

839
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,680
Dear, he woke up.

840
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,960
Lan, are you alright?

841
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,079
You look strange.

842
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:54,960
It's nothing.
I guess I was dreaming.

843
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,569
Dear, hurry up.

844
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,159
I'm walking as fast as I can.

845
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,000
What if he wakes up
and finds no one.

846
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:39,800
Oh, come on. He is an adult.
He can be by himself.

847
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:55,920
Dear, his fever is gone.

848
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,840
My trick worked. See?

849
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,079
Wow. I can't believe it.

850
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,649
This is great.

851
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,079
What trick?

852
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,880
Using a picture
to get rid of your fever.

853
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,680
What?

854
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:22,880
That has nothing to do with this.

855
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,609
It absolutely does. And that's
what I'm going to believe.

856
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:29,479
Hey, thank you for helping my son.

857
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:33,000
Without you, his condition
would've gotten worse.

858
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:34,800
Thank you.

859
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,479
Yes, thank you.

860
01:18:36,649 --> 01:18:39,649
Mom, be mindful of
the IV right in front of you.

861
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,529
My fever went down
thanks to the doctor.

862
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,479
This is what I want to believe.

863
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,119
I can get better on my own.
I don't have to rely on others.

864
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,649
Repeat,
I don't have to rely on others.

865
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,800
Lan, you didn't get sick
on your own.

866
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,920
You ran a fever

867
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:59,760
because your wound got infected.

868
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:02,569
Now will you tell me

869
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:05,840
how you got shot?

870
01:19:15,529 --> 01:19:17,569
I told you that
you can't miss it this time.

871
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:20,649
No, I don't want your excuses.

872
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,840
Find a way to deal with this.

873
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,439
I'll give you another chance.

874
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,239
If you fail, it's over.

875
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,880
Danai.

876
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,960
You scared me.

877
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,079
How long have you been here?

878
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:35,609
I've just arrived.

879
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:38,039
What's wrong? You look stressed.

880
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm fine.

881
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,649
It's just that my employee
failed to do their job.

882
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,239
Forget it.

883
01:19:50,569 --> 01:19:52,239
How can I forget it?

884
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:54,800
You're clearly stressed.
I should be worried about you.

885
01:19:57,039 --> 01:19:58,479
Well, I should be stressed.

886
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:03,279
It took us years
to prove ourselves to my dad.

887
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:07,479
But when it comes to Lan, Dad is
letting him manage the company.

888
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,609
He has zero credibility.

889
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,960
If he fails, who is going to be
responsible for that?

890
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:14,920
But your dad owns the company.

891
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:17,439
Eventually, it will belong
to you and Lan.

892
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,529
You're saying that like
Lan will take what's yours.

893
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,119
He will take it from me anyway.

894
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:25,239
This is unfair.

895
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,039
We've been through so much
to build the company to where it is.

896
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,680
He can't take it from me.

897
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:36,529
Lak, hold on.

898
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:39,279
Don't say that in front of your dad.

899
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,039
You're siblings.

900
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:43,199
You shouldn't
fight over inheritance.

901
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,479
Danai.

902
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:48,840
I'm doing this for both of us.

903
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:50,960
I know you're doing it for me.

904
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,529
But I don't want to be the cause
of this fight between you guys.

905
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,359
Besides,

906
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,039
Lan said he doesn't want
to work at the company.

907
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,840
Don't worry. Calm down.

908
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,609
I will do it for you.

909
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,529
If we lose this,
I won't stay quiet about it.

910
01:21:15,529 --> 01:21:16,720
We'll talk about that later.

911
01:21:17,079 --> 01:21:18,920
Now give me a smile.

912
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:22,960
I had a long day with my client.
I need something to cheer me up.

913
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,279
I'm not in the mood.

914
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:32,569
They got the wrong guy?

915
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:35,920
I don't believe you. Just tell me
you got into a fight with someone.

916
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:38,000
I didn't get into a fight
with anyone.

917
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,000
You're bedridden because
you were being irresponsible.

918
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:44,399
Let me tell you something.

919
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:47,439
Do you have to be close to death
before you finally learn something?

920
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,439
As soon as you get better,
you have to come to work.

921
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:55,119
Be a responsible man so you can
live a long life like other people.

922
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:56,720
This is an order.

923
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:00,159
I'm not working for you.

924
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,920
I will build my own company.

925
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:05,119
Ha! You must be joking.

926
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,039
You've never worked a day
in your life.

927
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:10,079
How would you build a company?
You would never succeed.

928
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:11,479
Are you underestimating me?

929
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,479
I know you.

930
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,680
You're boastful when you have
nothing to boast about.

931
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,960
Then why do you want me
to work at your company?

932
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,439
Aren't you scared that I'll ruin it?

933
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:29,159
I'm scared.

934
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:31,960
But I have no choice.

935
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,479
You're the heir of the family.

936
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:38,609
And you're the only person
who will carry on my work.

937
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:40,119
I don't want it.

938
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:44,960
Why are you so selfish?

939
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:46,920
Do you even worry about your family

940
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,840
or the company?

941
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,760
You can hand it over
to Lak and Danai.

942
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,079
She is also your daughter.
It doesn't have to be me.

943
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:58,199
Come on, Lan.
Your sister is a woman.

944
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:01,079
She became a stranger once
she took another man's last name.

945
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:03,960
Your brother-in-law is a stranger.

946
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,720
You have to carry on
the family name.

947
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,649
And you're the only person
who can carry on my work.

948
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,760
Stop trying to pass the buck.

949
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:15,680
Do you think Danai and I
are strangers?

950
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,800
I just realized
that I'm not your daughter.

951
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,920
You never think about handing
the company over to me, do you?

952
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:32,359
Lak, it's not what you think.

953
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,079
Your dad just...

954
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,039
They were fighting,
so it got a bit heated.

955
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:38,569
He didn't mean it.

956
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,720
It's nothing.
Don't take it seriously.

957
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,569
Dear, let's go outside now.

958
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:46,439
- Come with me.
- Alright.

959
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:56,800
Come here.

960
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,399
What is it?

961
01:23:58,569 --> 01:24:01,840
Look, can you think
before you speak for once?

962
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:04,039
What are Lak and Danai
going to think about you now?

963
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:07,880
Come on, Lan provoked me.

964
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,159
And do you think it's okay
to put pressure on him right now?

965
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,439
This is what happens when you let
your emotions get the better of you.

966
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:13,569
Well...

967
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:17,569
I don't know.

968
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:20,239
I had to do something.

969
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:23,199
If I don't something
and let this continue,

970
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:25,680
he will get killed someday.

971
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,279
You can still be nice about it.

972
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,079
Be nice, can you do that?

973
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,760
Has he ever listened to me
when I was nice to him?

974
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:37,079
Look.

975
01:24:37,319 --> 01:24:40,840
I'm going to make him go to work
no matter what.

976
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,159
If he refuses, I have to force him.

977
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,199
He insists on giving you the company
when you clearly don't want it.

978
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:51,279
Meanwhile, Danai and I
have worked so hard,

979
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:53,000
but in the end,
we're only strangers to him.

980
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:54,720
You want the company, right?

981
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:56,399
You can have it.

982
01:24:56,529 --> 01:24:57,920
Like Dad would allow that.

983
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,239
You saw how much
he wants you to run it.

984
01:25:02,529 --> 01:25:03,800
If I had a choice,

985
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,119
I wouldn't want him
to care about me.

986
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:07,800
It's unfair.

987
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:10,680
He loves you both.

988
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,609
He just has different ways
of showing it.

989
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,159
Are you his lawyer?

990
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,609
I'm trying to be objective.

991
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,119
- Don't worry.
- I don't want to worry.

992
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:28,880
But he always makes me.

993
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,199
I'm just looking out for
my best interests.

994
01:25:42,649 --> 01:25:44,199
What are you going to do
about the shooter?

995
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:46,800
Did you see him?

996
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,760
I didn't.

997
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,319
I haven't got a clue.

998
01:25:53,569 --> 01:25:55,920
What would you do
if they didn't get the wrong guy?

999
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:58,119
I think they got the wrong guy.

1000
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,399
Don't worry about me.

1001
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,760
Be careful from now on.
Let me know if anything happens.

1002
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,159
Alright.

1003
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:43,159
The rule of being a good fan
is appreciating your idol from afar.

1004
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:45,569
Don't take it any farther.
You will only get hurt.

1005
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,569
Find a way for me to
get in contact with DJ Prao.

1006
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,680
Are you going to pursue her?

1007
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,649
I've dug into DJ Prao's background.

1008
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:52,840
If you want to contact her,
you have to go through her manager.

1009
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,800
The possible suspect is DJ Prao.

1010
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,720
You showed up
and tried to get my intention.

1011
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:58,960
You set up the shooting

1012
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:02,119
when in fact you want the money
to pay off your debts.

1013
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,720
You risk yourself for money.

1014
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:05,760
You're disgusting.

1015
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,119
If I disgust you so much,
I'm going to marry you.
