1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,319
Alright. I'm selfish.

4
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
I don't care how he feels
or if he has a lover.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,560
I only care about my own interests.
I'm a bad person. Are you happy?

6
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,960
I will be happy
only if you cancel the wedding.

7
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,090
I'm going to marry him
no matter what.

8
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,439
From now on,
you will suffer with me.

9
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,719
Right, it's my choice.

10
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,039
As long as you're in this house,

11
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,319
I will never be at ease.

12
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,879
If you touch
my family's possessions,

13
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
I will do something about it.

14
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,919
You have to go to work now.
Time to stop playing around.

15
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,439
You're not afraid to show
your affection at work, aren't you?

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,240
From now on, Treenuch's company
will help us with media planning,

17
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,879
from online and billboard
advertising to TVC,

18
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,879
to improve
our marketing performance.

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Thank you for placing
your trust in my company.

20
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm glad to hear that
I will get to work with Lan

21
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
and Mook,

22
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,520
my old friends.

23
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Fortunately your company assigned
you to take care of us.

24
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,360
- Contact Lan if you have questions.
- I will.

25
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,439
Lak,

26
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,759
shouldn't she contact Danai
instead of me?

27
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,439
I'm going to assign you to work
with Danai in marketing anyway.

28
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,159
Danai oversees
the entire marketing aspect,

29
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,000
while you are in charge of
online media.

30
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,639
But if you think you can't do it,

31
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,680
that's fine.

32
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,479
Alright, I'll do it.

33
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,319
Mook, you work with Win
as we agreed on.

34
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,879
He will assign you to a new project
as a trial.

35
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,759
If you can't deliver,

36
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,800
I won't let you work here
even if you're backed by Dad.

37
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,399
Alright.

38
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Nuch.

39
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,839
I need to talk to you.

40
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,319
What is it about?

41
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,610
I want to congratulate you
on your marriage.

42
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,519
My marriage is a family matter.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,079
How do you know about it?

44
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,839
Your wedding ring.

45
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,199
It's just a mock marriage.
It doesn't mean anything.

46
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,560
That's what you think.
But does Mook have the same idea?

47
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,120
That's her problem, not mine.

48
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,560
Anyway, how is your stomach pain?

49
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,120
It's much better. But the pain
comes back when I miss a meal.

50
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,240
You know I have gastritis.

51
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,160
Thank you for worrying.

52
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,879
We'll be seeing a lot more
of each other now.

53
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,920
I hope we can go back
to what we were.

54
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Excuse me.

56
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,920
Let's talk later.

57
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,160
Here are the annual sales reports.

58
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,839
I've looked into Treenuch's,
Lan's ex-girlfriend, background.

59
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,759
She worked as a media planner

60
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,319
for a media agency.

61
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,279
Media planner. Good.

62
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Now our company needs a third party
to help us with media planning.

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,839
Lak, what are you planning to do?

64
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,879
I just want to find out
if I can rekindle Lan's old flame.

65
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,040
This will only create chaos
in our family.

66
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,399
He just announced that
Marut is his boyfriend.

67
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,199
He won't be interested in her.

68
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,079
You never know.
Treenuch was his first love.

69
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,279
First love is hard to forget.

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,879
It's Treenuch who can
get them to fight each other.

71
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,639
She may be able to break them up.

72
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,639
Then Mook will finally
leave our family alone.

73
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,720
Congratulations on
successfully capturing Lan.

74
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,839
After many failed attempts,

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,040
in the end, you had to use
the prophecy excuse again.

76
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,439
Thanks.

77
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,399
Have you ever heard the quote,
where there's a will there's a way?

78
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,759
But let me correct
your misunderstanding.

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
This isn't a mock marriage.

80
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,120
We legally registered our marriage.

81
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,759
It's just a piece of paper.
What's there to be proud of?

82
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,679
Although it's just a piece of paper,

83
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,720
it shows that Lan is mine,

84
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,399
and mine alone.

85
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,090
Is his heart yours too?

86
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,600
This is between Lan and me.
You have nothing to do with it.

87
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,330
Maybe not today, but someday I will.

88
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,159
Lan has never forgotten
about me anyway.

89
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,879
Your relationship is in the past.

90
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,879
I am his present and future.

91
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,799
You're mistaken, Praomook.

92
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,879
The relationship between
you and Lan never existed.

93
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,919
He doesn't love you.

94
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,639
He never has and never will.

95
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,159
Although you look pretty now,

96
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,480
in his eyes

97
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,120
you're just a worthless woman

98
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,600
who doesn't deserve his love.

99
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,759
Your mouth is as dirty as before.
I should clean it for you again.

100
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,330
- Mook!
- Go ahead.

101
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,279
If you hit me,
I will hit you right back.

102
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,720
You might even get an extra slap.

103
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,679
This is all a rude woman
like you can do.

104
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,679
Remember this.
He will never love you.

105
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I'm going to take him back.

106
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,799
Hold on to
your marriage certificate.

107
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
Don't let it out of your sight,
or I will tear it to shreds.

108
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
This new game

109
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,919
has the same boring
character design and storyline.

110
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,840
The world is plain, unoriginal.

111
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,759
Are you all out of ideas?

112
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,440
You can't use the same thing just
because the previous one did well.

113
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,039
You will bore the players.

114
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,960
We have less than two weeks

115
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,879
to release the demo.

116
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,639
And we've got nothing.
What are you going to do now?

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,679
Remember this.
No matter what you do,

118
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,559
you have to always
stay one step ahead.

119
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,519
Think big.
Don't be confined by old rules.

120
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,799
It's a trap that keeps you
from growing.

121
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480
If you want to be better,
dare to do something different.

122
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
Now, if you have an idea,
share it with me.

123
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,039
My job is to make
your idea come to life.

124
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,720
During these next three days,
you have to do your best.

125
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,639
If you have a problem, let me know.
I'm here to help you. Got it?

126
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,879
- Got it.
- Got it.

127
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,559
Good.

128
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,759
Show me what you got.
I'll be waiting.

129
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,399
Mook.

130
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes?

131
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,759
This is the concept and design
for the new furniture collection

132
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,799
that was released
before you started working here.

133
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,559
Take a look at it.

134
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,639
- Alright.
- Tell me if you have an idea.

135
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
I will.

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,200
If you have any questions,
you can always ask me or the team.

137
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,399
Sure.

138
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,080
(Marut)

139
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,879
Are you going to come to work?

140
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,240
Rut, this is Mook speaking.

141
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,720
Why are you answering his phone?

142
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm holding his phone hostage.

143
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,600
Hostage?

144
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,360
That's right.
I had to make him come to work.

145
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,759
You're brilliant for successfully
making him come to work.

146
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
It's a tough job.

147
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,480
This is his company
for crying out loud.

148
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,759
He has his reasons.

149
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,080
Apart from being a man
who doesn't take life seriously?

150
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,039
Or should I say a man
who doesn't take anything seriously?

151
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,519
If you knew him enough,
you wouldn't say that.

152
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,440
Right. It had been years
since we last saw each other.

153
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,679
We're pretty much strangers.

154
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,759
Unlike you,

155
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
you probably know
everything about him.

156
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,120
I envy you.

157
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,399
If you want to know more about him,
why don't we hang out sometime?

158
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,919
I want to know more about you too,

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
as a new friend of mine.

160
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Sure thing.

161
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
You gave me your word.

162
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,600
When I invite you, you can't refuse.

163
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Of course.

164
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,960
Oh no. I can't think of anything.
I'm dead.

165
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,960
If you can't come up with an idea,
you will get a big pay cut.

166
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Part-timer,

167
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,200
would you like to share your idea?

168
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,840
If your idea is interesting,
you will be able to help them.

169
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Yes, I'd love to.

170
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Boss,

171
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,039
she is good.

172
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I know.

173
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000
Your character is interesting.

174
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,410
You can send your design
to the development team.

175
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,519
Do you want to make more stuff?

176
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,799
I do.

177
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,319
Don't worry about your payment.
I'll take care of that for you.

178
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,680
But you have to stay late today.

179
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Okay.

180
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,559
My boss is bad as usual.

181
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,650
Oh, my.

182
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,720
Da, I think you could use some rest.

183
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,000
Ting, I can't.
I have some baking to do.

184
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,119
This customer wants them
delivered early in the morning.

185
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,599
If I don't make them now,
they won't be done in time.

186
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,759
It's fine. I can do it myself.

187
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,240
We'll get them done faster
if we work together.

188
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,039
Come on. Let's do it.
Then we can rest.

189
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,960
Alright. Walk carefully.

190
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,319
(Nampetch)

191
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,960
Hello, Petch.

192
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,960
Mom, I have to stay late today.
Something came up.

193
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,680
But you said you wouldn't have
to work overtime.

194
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,200
This is really necessary, Mom.

195
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,319
When will you come home?
Is it late? I will pick you up.

196
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,319
I'm not sure
when I will be finished.

197
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,650
Don't worry though.
I can get home by myself.

198
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,319
Mom, my boss, well,

199
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,319
Marut wants to talk to you.

200
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:56,960
Hold on.

201
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,559
Hello. This is Marut.

202
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,119
Hello.

203
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
We're working on an urgent project.

204
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,680
And Nampetch has been a great help.

205
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
So, I'd like to ask you
to allow her to stay late today.

206
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,170
Well.

207
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,240
Does she want to
work on this project?

208
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,519
Yes.

209
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,920
I guess I can't refuse then.

210
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,759
Anyway, please look after
my daughter for me.

211
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,410
Sure. I promise
I will get her home safely.

212
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,079
Done.

213
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
Get it done quickly,
so you can go home.

214
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Alright.

215
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,279
This looks interesting.

216
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Thank you.

217
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,000
- But I think, for this one,
- Okay.

218
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,839
- you should lower it a little.
- Lower it a little.

219
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,319
- Should I make it curvy?
- Yes.

220
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,960
- Okay. This actually looks better.
- Yes.

221
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,319
Alright.

222
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,170
Oh, Lan.

223
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,359
Are you here for Mook?

224
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,890
Not really.

225
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,279
I'm finished work.
I want my things back.

226
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,920
Are you giving them back
that easily?

227
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
I told you
I'd return them after work.

228
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,650
You're off duty now,
you can go wherever you want.

229
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,410
Look at you dismissing me.

230
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
Are you going to go home with me?

231
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,119
I can get back on my own.

232
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,279
Win.

233
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,650
- Yes?
- What do you think if I add a line?

234
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,799
Let me see.

235
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,279
Here.

236
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,960
Curve.

237
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,240
What about this?

238
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,200
With others, she turns on the charm.

239
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,359
I'm going home.

240
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,410
- How about this color?
- That's nice.

241
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,559
Oak, I'm in front of the building.
Where are you?

242
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Okay.

243
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,480
I have to find out how
you make contact with the attacker.

244
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,119
How are you doing tonight?

245
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,359
Can you add a drop shadow?

246
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,000
- How much do you want?
- Fifty percent.

247
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,160
It's done.

248
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,920
Well, this will do.

249
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,559
(Ting)

250
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,039
Hello, Ting.
Did Mom ask you to call me?

251
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,759
I'm about to go home.

252
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
What? Mom!

253
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,000
- It's finally over.
- Finally.

254
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,799
Alright.

255
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,400
- You're my driver tonight though.
- Oh, come on.

256
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,480
- Why don't you drive?
- No.

257
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,720
Come on.

258
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
Why are you following me?

259
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm not following you.

260
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,400
Tell me why you're following me.

261
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,680
If you lie, I will break your arm.

262
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,480
Mook, easy.
You're going to break his arm.

263
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,599
Hey! You're going to break her arm.

264
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,720
We can talk this out.

265
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,160
That isn't what you said earlier.

266
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,759
Come on. Just ignore that.

267
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,200
Let go of her and be civil.

268
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,920
Alright. Now, tell me
why you are following me.

269
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
Have you been watching me?

270
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes, in case you let it slip that
you're planning something.

271
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,079
And have you found out anything?

272
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,480
Not for now, but one day I will.

273
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,799
You won't find anything because
I'm not planning anything.

274
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,759
(Ting)

275
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,200
Hello, Ting.

276
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,039
Mom...

277
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
Oak.

278
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,920
Mom is at a hospital.

279
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,799
I'll take you there.

280
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Come with me.

281
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,519
- Ting.
- Mook.

282
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
How is Mom?

283
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,039
The doctor hasn't come out yet.
I don't know.

284
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,519
Mom.

285
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,279
Mook, she will be okay.

286
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,599
Where is Petch?

287
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,359
Petch isn't home yet.
She said she would be home late.

288
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,079
Irresponsible. I can't rely on her.

289
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:59,960
Mook, Ting, how is Mom?

290
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,279
Where were you?
Why weren't you with Mom?

291
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,480
I can't rely on you
to do anything, can I?

292
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,759
Is this the time to yell?

293
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,599
This is because
you are being irresponsible.

294
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,920
You know I wasn't home
and Mom is unwell.

295
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,960
Instead of staying at home
and looking after her,

296
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,880
you come home later than before.

297
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,759
Next time don't bother coming home
since you're useless anyway.

298
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,160
Don't you want to ask me first
why I have to come home late?

299
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,759
You've been blaming me
since I got here.

300
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,000
I didn't ask because I don't want
to hear your excuses.

301
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
How many times have you done this?

302
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,400
Will there be a time where
you don't weigh us down?

303
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,000
Is it so uncomfortable
to stay at home?

304
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,200
Do you think you're the only one
with problems?

305
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,160
Stop thinking only about yourself.

306
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,960
Right. I'm selfish.
I only think about myself.

307
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,039
Do you know why I have to
leave the house every day?

308
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,599
It's because of you.

309
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,039
You're the most annoying sister.

310
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,119
I'd rather be an only child
than have you as my sister.

311
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,960
- Stop talking, Petch.
- No, I will not.

312
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,440
I want you to realize that you
destroyed our family's happiness.

313
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,920
Had you come back to Dad sooner,

314
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,559
had you done your duty
as a big sister,

315
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,519
Dad wouldn't be in this state.

316
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,400
It's your fault Dad is bedridden
and Mom is suffering.

317
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,839
It's your fault. You hear me?
It's all your fault.

318
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
- It's your fault.
- Oh.

319
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,079
Mook!

320
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,079
- I...
- Even now you're making a mistake.

321
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,200
You won't even listen to me.

322
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,880
I hate you.

323
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Petch.

324
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Mook.

325
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,799
Watch out!

326
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
Boss.

327
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,000
Petch, are you hurt?

328
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I'm fine.

329
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,640
Hey. Hey!

330
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Hey!

331
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,519
Are you hurt?

332
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,839
I'm fine.

333
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,680
That's good to hear.
Now, listen to me.

334
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,559
If I didn't help you in time,
you would be dead.

335
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,240
Don't help me next time then.
Just let me die.

336
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,640
If only your death wasn't a burden
to the people around you.

337
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Boss.

338
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,599
If you got hit,
the driver would be at fault.

339
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,559
You'd get to die as you wish, but
you wouldn't know your mistake.

340
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,119
Or you could be paralyzed.
Is that what you want?

341
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,160
Next time something happens, I won't
waste my time trying to help you.

342
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,319
Even if you're dying in front of me,
I won't even bother.

343
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,960
You're so mean.

344
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,039
I feel terrible,
but you keep scolding me.

345
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,880
What? Do you want me to console you?

346
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I can't do it.

347
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,920
Because what happened
was your fault.

348
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,400
It wasn't my fault. Mook was wrong
for looking down on me.

349
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,960
She thought I was being
irresponsible when I wasn't.

350
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,759
Well, did you tell your sister
that you were working for me?

351
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,039
I didn't.

352
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,880
Why didn't you tell her?

353
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:05,960
Since she got married
and moved in with Lan,

354
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,799
I haven't talked to her.

355
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,200
Even though you have a cell phone?
You could've given her a call.

356
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,839
Or you could've just texted her
if you didn't want to talk.

357
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,920
She wouldn't believe me
if I told her I got a job.

358
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
How do you know
she would think that?

359
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,359
- Well...
- You just assumed, right?

360
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,240
In the end, this whole thing
happened because of you.

361
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,400
You were wrong for not telling her.

362
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,039
You were wrong for being cruel
to your sister.

363
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,880
If you can't fix your family issues,

364
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,480
I won't let you come to work again.

365
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Rut.

366
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,440
- Alright, I won't...
- Get a hold of yourself.

367
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,920
Think before you speak.

368
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,160
If you speak without thinking
and throw away your chance,

369
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
I won't give you a second chance.

370
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,599
You can throw away
this chance on a whim,

371
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,640
or fix your problem
once and for all.

372
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,640
Make your choice.

373
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,799
Mook.

374
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,960
Oak, I hit my sister.

375
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,319
Take it easy.

376
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,400
She was right about everything.

377
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,759
This is all my fault.

378
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,359
Mook, listen to me.

379
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,769
You can feel guilty.
But never blame yourself.

380
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,360
It's not your fault
that your parents are sick.

381
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,329
Sometimes things are inevitable.

382
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,039
But you're not alone in this.

383
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,159
You have me.

384
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,440
I'm always here for you.

385
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:26,360
Thanks.

386
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,960
Mook, I'm here for you too.

387
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,480
Are you done?

388
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:42,159
If you're done,
let me say something.

389
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,880
I don't know about other things,

390
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,880
but what you did to your sister
was wrong.

391
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,199
This is between me and my sister.
It's none of your business.

392
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,119
I don't want to butt in,

393
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,079
but I can't stay silent about this.

394
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,159
You do things your way
without thinking about others.

395
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,679
With me, you made me marry you
even though I didn't want to.

396
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,199
The world doesn't revolve
around you, you know.

397
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,440
If you're going to blame me,
you can shut your mouth now.

398
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,679
There. When you don't like
what I say, you don't listen.

399
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,199
It's just like what you did
to your sister.

400
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,679
Did you ask her where she was
and why she came home late?

401
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,039
You scolded her
before you asked her.

402
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,559
You thought she was being
irresponsible and undependable.

403
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,559
How do you know she is undependable?

404
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,440
Have you given her
a chance to prove herself?

405
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,809
Lan, stop making it worse for her.
She feels bad enough.

406
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,440
What about Petch? How would she feel

407
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,960
after being called
useless and irresponsible?

408
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:45,360
You don't think about how
your words might affect someone.

409
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,880
If I were your sister,
I would feel terrible.

410
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,329
You know,

411
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,840
being looked down on by other people
is nothing compared to your family.

412
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,639
Don't deny that
Petch's words don't affect you.

413
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,559
The patient has an irregular
heartbeat, resulting in chest pain,

414
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,239
shortness of breath, and fatigue.

415
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,840
After a careful examination,
she shows no sign of heart disease.

416
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,639
It could be a result of
sleep deprivation and stress.

417
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,440
I'm going to keep her overnight.

418
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,000
If there are no complications,
she should be able to go home.

419
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,559
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

420
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:36,599
- You're welcome. Well, excuse me.
- Sure.

421
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,119
Mook.

422
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,360
I want you to know that
I wasn't being irresponsible.

423
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,159
I'm a part-time employee
at Marut's gaming company.

424
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,769
I want to help you and Mom
by making money.

425
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:39,840
I know that it isn't a lot of money.

426
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,599
But at least I won't have to
ask you and Mom for money.

427
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,639
Another reason why I want to
do this job is that I love it.

428
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,809
Working on something I love
makes me happy.

429
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,329
I don't care how tiring it is.

430
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:01,960
Just like how you love making music.

431
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,769
You work as a DJ because of that.

432
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,159
You don't get tired
even if you have to stay late.

433
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,289
You even enjoy doing your job.

434
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:13,559
Does Mom know about this?

435
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,809
She does. She gave me permission.

436
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,199
She told me to tell you,
but I didn't because

437
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,239
I was afraid you would stop me
and I would miss this opportunity.

438
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,519
If you told me this from the start,
I wouldn't have said anything.

439
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,329
You worry too much.

440
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,809
Does it hurt?

441
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,400
I'm sorry for hitting you.

442
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,239
I'm sorry for not listening to you,

443
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,559
making you feel like
you can't talk to me

444
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,920
when we are family.

445
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,519
You can do this job if you want to.
I won't stop you.

446
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,840
Rut, please take care of
your employee for me.

447
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,079
If she does anything wrong,
you can scold her.

448
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,239
Don't worry.

449
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,400
I take care of all my employees.

450
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,239
Why are you crying?

451
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,920
I just feel like crying.

452
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,079
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

453
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,519
Stop crying.
You're embarrassing yourself.

454
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,329
- Hey, Rut.
- Ouch!

455
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,920
Are you alright?

456
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,960
My arm hurts a little.

457
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:27,679
I might've hit something when
I saved Nampetch

458
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,679
from getting hit by a car.

459
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,679
Hit by a car? Did you get hit?

460
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,079
No.

461
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,199
I guess I hit something
when I was helping her.

462
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,679
Let me see.

463
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,809
It's nothing bad. I'm okay.

464
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,079
- Nothing bad? Let me see.
- Lan.

465
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Take off your jacket.

466
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
Careful.

467
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,289
Let me see.

468
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:00,039
Woah. This looks bad.

469
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,159
You should see a doctor.

470
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,840
What's going on, Lan?

471
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,329
Take a look at your boss, Poom.

472
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,119
Look.

473
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,639
Boss, your shoulder is bruised.
You should get it looked at.

474
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,239
I told you, I'm fine.

475
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,769
- Ah!
- Rut!

476
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:29,400
Don't be stubborn.

477
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:32,519
It's badly bruised.
You could have a broken bone.

478
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:34,639
Our company isn't ready to lose you.

479
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,289
Just hold on until
the bonus period is over.

480
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,559
Poom, you...

481
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,639
- Oh.
- Rut.

482
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:44,289
Careful.

483
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,159
Let me see it again.

484
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,769
- Wow.
- Ah, that hurts.

485
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,289
Boss. Lan.

486
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:13,719
The doctor will probably keep her
here until tomorrow morning.

487
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,769
What are you going to do?
Are you going to stay with her?

488
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,809
I can stay with her.

489
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,199
Mook and Petch, you two
should go home and rest.

490
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,159
I'd rather stay with Mom.

491
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,000
I will be home alone anyway.

492
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,199
Do you trust me?

493
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,159
Alright.

494
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,159
Ting, you can go home tonight.

495
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,599
But don't play games
and forget to look after Mom.

496
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,960
- Mook.
- Mook.

497
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,360
I'm just saying.

498
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
You can't.

499
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:44,679
Take care of Mom for me.

500
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,679
Trust me.

501
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,639
I can do better
than all the nurses in this ward.

502
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,079
- Cheeky.
- Oh, come on.

503
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:00,809
Let's get a taxi
to where I parked my car.

504
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,679
I will drop you off first,
then Ting. Is that alright?

505
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,079
Alright.

506
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,639
Your husband is unbelievable.
Instead of waiting for you,

507
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:11,039
he went home with his boyfriend

508
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,880
and left his wife by herself.

509
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:17,289
Should I be angry or confused?
This is so complicated.

510
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,480
I agree.
Thinking about it riles me up.

511
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:22,199
If he were my husband,

512
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:24,880
when I got home,
I would hit him left and right

513
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,239
to teach him a lesson
for letting someone else come first.

514
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,199
I'm so angry.

515
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,329
Forget about him.
He doesn't care about me.

516
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,440
Oh, Mook.

517
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:39,639
In your eyes, I'm no good, right?

518
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:49,000
I didn't leave with my boyfriend.

519
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,239
You don't have to teach me
a lesson now, do you?

520
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,559
He heard that.

521
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,119
I thought you already left.

522
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,760
My parents would give me an earful
if I did that.

523
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,960
So you're following
your parents' orders.

524
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,840
Yes, if they didn't give me
the order, I wouldn't bother.

525
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,360
So are you ready to go home?
Should I give you all a ride?

526
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:15,599
Alright, our ride is here.

527
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,000
You don't have to give us a ride.
We can take a taxi.

528
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,239
You can take her home.

529
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,800
See you later. Bye.

530
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
- Bye.
- See you later, Mook. Bye.

531
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,000
- Ting, hurry.
- Alright, let's go. Bye.

532
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,599
Bye. Get home safely.

533
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,960
Are you ready to go home?
I'm sleepy.

534
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Wait.

535
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:42,239
What is it?

536
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,280
Where are you headed?
My car is that way.

537
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,480
Then lead the way.

538
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,920
I don't need you
to care about me anyway.

539
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,960
What did you say? Are you coming?

540
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,559
Lan, wait for me.
I can't keep up with you.

541
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,800
Stop following me,
you annoying duckling.

542
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,239
Aren't you getting out?

543
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,039
Hey, Lan. Where are you going?

544
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,760
I'm going to take care of Rut.

545
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,880
You can have the bed tonight.

546
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:14,199
Enjoy it however you want.

547
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,960
Lan, hey!

548
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,960
Oh, Danai, I'm sorry.

549
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,159
It's late. Are you still up?

550
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,480
I was looking for something to eat
after finishing my work.

551
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:40,159
I heard Lan's car so I came to
check it out. Where is he?

552
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,480
He dropped me off and
is heading to Rut's place now.

553
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,400
Something happened.

554
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:46,719
Oh.

555
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:49,719
How is your mother?

556
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,440
She is fine now. She should be able
to go home tomorrow.

557
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:55,159
That's good to hear.

558
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,960
Alright, you should get some rest.

559
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,519
Okay.

560
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

561
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,039
It's fine. I can do it.

562
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
Go to sleep.

563
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,920
Okay.

564
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,719
You're overthinking it.
It's just an accident, nothing more.

565
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,480
Boss, eat this and take your pills.
I've prepared them for you.

566
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,920
- Thanks.
- Poom.

567
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,920
Can I have some too?
I haven't eaten since this evening.

568
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:23,960
Well, this is the only bowl left.

569
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Then let me have that.

570
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
What?

571
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:41,719
What are you doing?

572
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,639
I'm feeding you.

573
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,679
Eat it and take your medicine.
Then we can all go to sleep.

574
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:50,199
Hurry.

575
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:11,960
If I post this picture,
will your girls think that

576
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,519
you two are lovers?

577
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,639
- Poom.
- Poom.

578
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,760
Let's post a different picture.

579
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:23,400
You can have the rest. I'm full.

580
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,960
Boss, your right arm isn't working.
Should you take a day off?

581
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,559
No, I can use my left arm.

582
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,800
It's not my dominant arm.
But it's better than skipping work.

583
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,199
We have an urgent project to finish.

584
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,480
If there's something I can't do,
I will ask you to do it for me.

585
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:46,159
Roger that.

586
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,519
- Lan.
- Hm?

587
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,360
I have some questions.

588
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
What?

589
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,239
The suspect

590
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,840
is likely to be left-handed.

591
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,119
Yes, you're right.

592
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,880
But it's uncertain

593
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:23,960
if he carried a gun.

594
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Do you remember

595
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,719
which hand was the gunman using
when you were attacked in Korea?

596
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,440
I'm not sure.

597
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,360
It was very dark and I was running
for my life. I didn't notice it.

598
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:46,960
There was another person
at the scene.

599
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
Praomook.

600
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:01,760
Hey! What are you doing?

601
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
What?

602
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,519
Lan! Help!

603
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,519
Help! Anybody, help!

604
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,639
Lan!

605
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,599
- What is it?
- Are you at Rut's place?

606
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:47,199
Why do you ask?

607
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,039
So I can come and find you in case
you're hanging out at a bar.

608
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,719
I'm at Rut's house.

609
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,400
Turn on your camera,
so I know you're telling the truth.

610
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,360
Hey. What are you doing?

611
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,320
Just play along.

612
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:22,559
Mook.

613
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,440
I'm lying with Rut on our bed.

614
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,599
- On your bed.
- We're not doing anything.

615
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,760
Don't be shy.

616
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,400
With him by my side,
I don't have to go out.

617
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,159
Right, babe?

618
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,119
Rut,

619
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:43,280
please watch him for me.
Don't let him sneak out.

620
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:46,199
Give it to me.

621
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,239
Mook, do you need anything?

622
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:51,880
It's nothing.

623
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:54,960
I just don't want him
to cause anyone trouble.

624
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:58,519
Sure. I will watch him
and keep him from sneaking out.

625
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,039
Rut.

626
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,239
Don't worry.

627
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:09,719
That's all you want to know, right?
Let's end the call.

628
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,199
I'm going to spend time
with my babe.

629
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Hey.

630
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,760
She is annoying.

631
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,639
It's just a nightmare, Mook.
You worry too much.

632
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,079
She worries about you.

633
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:39,880
She was checking that you're safe.

634
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,519
You seem to know her well.

635
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,119
She just tried to annoy me.
She doesn't worry about me.

636
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:53,559
I guess.

637
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Right. She doesn't worry about you.
Are you happy?

638
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:02,360
Now, go back to your room.
I want to sleep.

639
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:08,760
Come on, babe. Don't kick me out.

640
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:13,199
Can I stay with you tonight?
Please, babe.

641
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:16,360
Alright, come here.

642
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,480
You have something on your back.

643
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,800
- Ah!
- It's my foot.

644
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,559
- Rut, you...
- Hey.

645
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,239
Go back to your room, babe.

646
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:42,320
Why do you want to know about when
Lan was attacked in Korea?

647
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,239
Have you found the shooter?

648
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,440
We're trying to
identify the shooter.

649
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,920
If we count the attack in Korea,

650
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,920
Lan has faced
three attempts on his life.

651
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:55,920
And you rescued him every time.

652
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,440
I don't think
it's a string of coincidences.

653
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:02,360
Are you meeting me today
because you suspect me?

654
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,800
It's not like that.

655
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:09,400
I want you to try to remember which
hand the shooter was holding a gun.

656
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:12,440
Details like this might help us
identify the shooter.

657
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,440
I'm not sure.

658
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,320
What about the car accident?

659
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,039
A man followed us on his bike.

660
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,800
He aimed his gun at Lan.

661
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,239
I'm positive that he held it
in his left hand.

662
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,159
Other than that, I can't remember
anything else about him.

663
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,039
This is good enough.

664
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,639
I warned Lan about this.

665
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,719
But he thought I was making
things up and refused to listen.

666
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,880
He is narrow-minded.
How can he be so grumpy?

667
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,639
He probably has his reasons.

668
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:54,159
Although we might not
understand him.

669
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,039
Right.

670
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:59,239
Does your arm still hurt?

671
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:02,079
A lot.

672
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:08,159
Hey. Stay away from him.

673
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,719
Now that you're done,
you're free to leave.

674
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,440
You heard everything, right?

675
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:18,639
- Heard what?
- About the shooter.

676
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:21,280
I said everything I can remember.

677
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,199
I hope you can stop thinking
that I'm involved.

678
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,559
I won't stop until I catch him.

679
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,519
Then you can apologize
for accusing me.

680
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,440
I don't care.

681
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,320
I just want to uncover the truth.

682
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,400
Alright. Now that we've finished
talking about the shooter,

683
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,679
it's time to talk about you and me.

684
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,920
Excuse me, Rut. See you later.

685
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,440
Later.

686
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Where are you taking me?

687
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:58,880
He pretended to resist,

688
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,519
but he went with her anyway.

689
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,800
Where are you taking me?

690
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,280
To work.

691
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,480
You have a job to do.
It's your responsibility.

692
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:18,679
Okay. I'll go.

693
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:20,800
See you at the office.

694
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,519
Are you planning something?

695
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,079
Don't you trust me?

696
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
I don't.

697
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,199
Keep this. See you at the office.

698
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,960
What is he playing at?

699
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,719
I'm returning them.

700
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:25,800
You came to work easily
because you wanted to play a game.

701
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
I guess so.

702
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,320
You can leave.
I need to concentrate.

703
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,519
Dad sent me documents from
the company's again.

704
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,960
He sends them every month.
Doesn't he get tired of doing it?

705
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,920
But you read it every time.

706
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,639
I just skim through it.

707
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,159
- Rut.
- Hm?

708
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Look at this.

709
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,360
Do you think this sales figure
is lower than it's supposed to be?

710
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Right.

711
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,760
You should tell your dad
to take a look at it.

712
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,239
I'm sending it to Lak.

713
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,320
If something is wrong, it'll be
better if she tells Dad about it.

714
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
Okay.

715
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
Danai.

716
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,000
Sorry. I wasn't looking
where I was going.

717
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,960
Is there something wrong?

718
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,119
Don't do that again.

719
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,360
I can walk on my own.
I don't need help.

720
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:26,199
I didn't do anything.

721
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,079
But if it makes you
feel uncomfortable,

722
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:31,159
I apologize.

723
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,519
What did he do?

724
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:42,679
Why did he have to apologize?

725
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,840
He touched me without my permission.

726
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,039
I was upset. Apologizing
is the right thing to do.

727
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,920
Are you saying
he sexually harassed you?

728
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:55,320
That's a serious accusation.

729
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:57,320
I didn't say that.

730
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,639
You didn't say it,

731
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:01,360
but your eyes and actions
said it all.

732
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,119
- Just forget about it, Lak.
- No, I won't have this.

733
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:09,920
She accused you and
behaved inappropriately.

734
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,119
Danai is my husband.

735
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:15,679
You will show him the same
respect that you show me.

736
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:18,440
Just because my parents support you,
it doesn't mean you can do anything.

737
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,000
This is getting
blown out of proportion.

738
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,920
I simply made myself clear.

739
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,320
It doesn't mean I disrespect him.

740
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,719
What you're doing is arguing with me
over a nonsensical matter.

741
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,119
Are you talking back to me?

742
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,519
I'm defending myself
because I didn't do anything wrong.

743
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,360
I have my dignity.

744
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:36,920
Do you?

745
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,519
Do you still have any dignity left?

746
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,400
I won't let you
strip anything off me.

747
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:46,360
What belongs to me,

748
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,719
I won't let you take it.

749
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,400
I will keep that in mind.

750
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,599
Keep an eye on your possessions.

751
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,920
If you're done with me,
I'm going to get back to work.

752
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:03,039
Wait.

753
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,960
If I catch you behaving in a way
that's unbecoming as an in-law,

754
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,360
I will handle you myself.

755
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,440
Oh, Mook, you've arrived.
I've been waiting for you.

756
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:45,440
How can I help you?

757
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,119
I have a meeting with our client.
Could you come with me?

758
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:51,559
You might be able to
take over for me.

759
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:55,039
That's a good idea.
I'm tired of being at the office.

760
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,920
What did you think
you were doing, Danai?

761
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,079
Just tell me what you think I did.

762
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,760
You've taken an interest in her.
You want her, don't you?

763
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,760
You're being overdramatic.

764
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,639
I would never think that.

765
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,760
It was a misunderstanding.
There's nothing more to it.

766
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:37,960
I will believe you.

767
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,880
But remember this, Danai.

768
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,760
You got this position
because of my love for you.

769
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,159
If you disappoint me,
I'm ready to destroy you.

770
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:58,239
I always keep that in mind.

771
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,119
I am where I am today
because of you.

772
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,599
I will never replace you
with another woman.

773
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,920
I love only you.

774
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,199
I love you too.

775
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,000
I'm willing to do anything for you.

776
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,840
Darn it.

777
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,280
Remember this, Danai.

778
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,840
You got this position
because of my love for you.

779
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:38,880
If you disappoint me,
I'm ready to destroy you.

780
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:42,719
Love.

781
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,079
I feel sick.

782
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Lan.

783
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,719
I need your opinion on something.
Do you have time for me?

784
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:08,559
I do.

785
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,079
You could've given me a call.
You didn't have to travel here.

786
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,679
Well, I miss you.

787
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,440
Will you go out to lunch with me?

788
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,599
I was busy all morning.
I haven't eaten anything today.

789
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,360
My stomach is starting to feel
uncomfortable. Come on, Lan.

790
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:35,400
Aren't we friends?

791
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:39,800
Can't you do it for me?

792
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,599
Let's have lunch before we go back.

793
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,400
It's my treat.
Think of it as a welcoming gift.

794
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,280
Okay.

795
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,440
- Thanks.
- That's your beloved wife.

796
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:12,320
She came with Win. They seem close.

797
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
I didn't think
I would meet you two here.

798
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,280
We had a meeting with our client

799
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,239
and thought we should
have lunch before we head back.

800
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,559
Lan and I are here
to discuss some business too.

801
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,079
But he didn't want me
to get a stomach ache,

802
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,440
so we decided to
eat something first.

803
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,800
I hope you don't
misunderstand me, Mook.

804
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,639
I won't, as long as
you're just having lunch.

805
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,280
However, if you do more than that...

806
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:46,559
Filthy mind.

807
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:49,000
Don't think
other people are like you.

808
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,920
I haven't said anything.

809
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,480
I could be referring to
having coffee and snacks,

810
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,639
or watching a movie.

811
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,440
Who's has the filthy mind here?

812
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,360
Do spouses
greet each other like this?

813
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:08,960
I think we shouldn't disturb them.
Let's get inside.

814
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,400
Let's go.

815
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:05,880
Thank you.

816
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:11,039
Here, Lan.

817
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:18,840
Lan, have you studied
how the design team works?

818
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,569
If you have any questions,
you can always ask me.

819
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,680
Sure. I have a lot of questions.

820
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Alright.

821
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:35,720
The suspect
is likely to be left-handed.

822
01:09:41,079 --> 01:09:42,529
Win, are you left-handed?

823
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,319
You are the minority.

824
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:30,119
I'm positive that he held
the gun in his left hand.

825
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,199
Mook.

826
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:38,159
It's fine. I'll get it.

827
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,529
Mook, what's wrong?

828
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:11,000
You look pale.
Did something scare you?

829
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:13,159
I'm fine.

830
01:11:17,529 --> 01:11:18,760
Excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

831
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,239
Mook.

832
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,039
Are you alright?

833
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:31,720
I feel faint.

834
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,840
Lan, I feel like I can't breathe.

835
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:41,840
I should take her to a doctor.

836
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:43,649
Win, could you take Nuch
with you to the office?

837
01:11:46,529 --> 01:11:49,159
Lan, wait. I'm coming with you.

838
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:51,609
I'll give you a ride.

839
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,159
You're an outsider.
You shouldn't follow them.

840
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,159
Let go.

841
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,399
You can let go of me.

842
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:12,609
Did you trick me?

843
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I did.

844
01:12:14,649 --> 01:12:17,319
- You're so...
- Were you worried about me?

845
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,119
How could you let go like that?
That hurt.

846
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:30,039
I shouldn't have forgotten that
you're a tough, bold, sly woman.

847
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:31,359
You won't get sick easily.

848
01:12:31,609 --> 01:12:33,760
That's right. I won't die easily.

849
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,760
And you're a pervert
no matter where you are.

850
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,319
Don't think I didn't see
what you and Nuch were doing.

851
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,039
If I didn't stop you, you would
be doing it in the restaurant.

852
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:46,960
Your mind is really filthy.

853
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,960
I guess I'm like you.

854
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,680
If Nuch and I didn't run into you,
you might've slept with him later.

855
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:56,319
You're so flirty. Do you plan
to take every guy you meet?

856
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:00,359
Win, Rut, Danai, and me.
How dirty of you.

857
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,319
Why do you have such a nasty mouth?

858
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,479
Did I hit the nail on the head?

859
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,079
I'm not going to stand around
and let you hit me.

860
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:15,000
Oh, and I won't kiss you
if you slap me. It's disgusting.

861
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,529
Who knows what kind of stuff
has gone into your mouth?

862
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:21,760
Right. I'm dirty.

863
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,720
If you don't want anything to do
with me, let go of my arm.

864
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,840
Why? Are you mad?

865
01:13:33,529 --> 01:13:34,760
This is nothing.

866
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:39,079
I told you before. You're going to
suffer with me in this marriage.

867
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:43,800
You destroy my happiness.
I destroy yours.

868
01:13:44,529 --> 01:13:45,920
Endure it if you can.

869
01:13:46,649 --> 01:13:47,880
Endure it if you cannot.

870
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,199
Alright.

871
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:54,119
I'm curious to know
who can endure this for longer.

872
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:59,199
I'm going to mess with your life,
making you suffer.

873
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:02,279
You will feel what I feel.

874
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:03,960
Get ready for whatever lies ahead.

875
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:28,800
Brat, how dare she kick me.

876
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:51,039
How did you get here and why?

877
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:57,680
Don't tell me...

878
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,079
I'm moving in with my husband.

879
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,399
Wherever you go, I will go with you.

880
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,359
What? You let
the duckling come here?

881
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:25,439
If you don't tell me why she's here,
I'm going to kick her out.

882
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:26,569
Lan,

883
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,239
are you trying to stay away from her

884
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:30,800
because you hate her or
because she makes you feel things?

885
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,720
You told me you married her
to find out about the shooter.

886
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:38,159
But you ran away from her
before you could even start that.

887
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:41,399
I don't think you hate her
as you claim to do.

888
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:43,960
She doesn't make me feel things
and I'm not running away from her.

889
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:45,960
- Really?
- Yes.

890
01:15:46,529 --> 01:15:48,569
That's good to hear.

891
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,760
It means I made the right decision
to let her stay at the house.

892
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,479
I'll help you, Lan.

893
01:15:56,649 --> 01:15:57,760
What are you planning to do?

894
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,960
I will try to get close to her.

895
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,760
Make her fall in love with me
and divorce you as soon as possible.

896
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:08,159
Did you forget you're pretending
to be my boyfriend?

897
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,239
If you pursue her, she will find out
that I made the whole thing up.

898
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:14,199
I think love is genderless.

899
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,880
Mook is a progressive woman.
She can understand this.

900
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:19,840
I'll handle this matter.

901
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:22,359
This is a win-win situation for you.

902
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,359
So, she will stay at my house.
Got it?

903
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,760
Whatever.

904
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:46,649
You can stay here.

905
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,920
You said it.

906
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:51,800
We have to make a deal first.

907
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,159
We can discuss that inside.

908
01:16:55,079 --> 01:16:56,239
And pick up my bag.

909
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,529
Do it yourself.
I'm not your servant.

910
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:03,199
You injured me.
You have to pay for what you did.

911
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,680
Injured?

912
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:08,569
You look fine.

913
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,199
It can't be that bad if you can
follow a man to his house.

914
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,399
What are you doing? That hurts!

915
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,960
You're exaggerating.
It doesn't hurt that much.

916
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,960
Wait for my turn, brat.

917
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,920
If you want to stay here,
you must follow my rules.

918
01:17:49,609 --> 01:17:53,159
One, mind your own business.

919
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,800
Two, leave me and Rut alone.

920
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:00,649
Three, do not be selfish.
Respect people's boundaries.

921
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,479
Four, do not enter my room.

922
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,720
If you fail to follow these rules,
you will be kicked out.

923
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,720
Are you done?

924
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,399
- I'm done.
- Now, listen to my rule.

925
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:17,159
I have one rule:
I don't follow anyone's rules.

926
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:20,079
Which is why
I will not follow your rules.

927
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,199
Then you can't stay here. Get out.

928
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:35,079
Do whatever you want.
I'm not going anywhere.

929
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:38,479
I can do whatever I want?

930
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,279
Don't say I'm mean. You started it.

931
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,960
Rude. Barbaric.

932
01:19:05,569 --> 01:19:08,279
Are you happy?
I'm only this way with you.

933
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,119
I should be proud.

934
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,800
I have a husband who is not only
irresponsible and ridiculous

935
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,609
but also rude and barbaric.

936
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,960
Is there something else
I should be proud of?

937
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,159
I will be so bad to you
that you can't stand it.

938
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,800
I will give you another chance.
Follow my rules, or get out.

939
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,800
Rut owns this house.
You're a guest just like me.

940
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:38,960
So I don't have to
follow your rules.

941
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:42,119
I moved here to be closer to you.

942
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,479
So I will be around you 24/7.
Is that clear?

943
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:51,529
The longer you're near me,

944
01:19:52,039 --> 01:19:54,569
the tighter I will hold on to you.

945
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:57,000
I will interfere with your life.

946
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,199
I don't care
if it will drive you crazy.

947
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:04,319
You can try to endure it.

948
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,359
There's nothing else you can do.

949
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,920
We'll find out who will endure.

950
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,840
I will make you get used to
having me around.

951
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:19,399
And I will make you love me so much
that you can't go on without me.

952
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,569
I will never love you.

953
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:45,609
Brace yourself, Chalantorn.

954
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,319
A greedy, worthless woman like you
can't do anything to me.

955
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:51,119
Seeing your face turns me off.

956
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,359
I will show you that
your attempts are futile.

957
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:56,159
You don't know how to love anyone.

958
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,649
You're doing this
because you only love yourself.

959
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:03,649
How dare you say that
I don't know how to love anyone.

960
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:05,920
It's you who are incapable of love.

961
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:09,529
I know how to love.

962
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,720
But you destroyed my love, Praomook.

963
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:29,760
It's you who destroyed my love.

964
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:45,840
You want to move into my house.

965
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,039
That's right. As his wife,

966
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,039
I have to go where Lan goes.

967
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:53,680
But no one knows you're married.

968
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,800
You don't have to be
by his side all the time.

969
01:21:57,079 --> 01:22:00,569
Besides, I want to be alone
with him, not around strangers.

970
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:07,569
Do you have a better reason

971
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,920
to convince me to change my mind?

972
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:14,199
Then don't see me as a stranger.

973
01:22:14,359 --> 01:22:16,039
See me as your friend.

974
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:17,569
Think about it.

975
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,399
If his parents find out that I don't
move in with you, they will be angry

976
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,399
and order him to move back.

977
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,960
However, if I move in with you,

978
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,960
it will allow
you two to live together.

979
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,319
I know unrequited love is painful.

980
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:35,399
I don't want to be
an obstacle to your love.

981
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:40,800
I promise I won't ruin
the love between you and Lan.

982
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:48,840
I will beat you, Chalantorn.

983
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:15,920
What will be your next move, Mook?

984
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,479
I moved here to be closer to you.

985
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,569
The longer you're near me,

986
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,529
the tighter I will hold on to you.

987
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,199
Try to endure it.

988
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,199
There's nothing else you can do.

989
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:49,319
What?

990
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:13,840
If I wasn't worried that it would
complicate things, I'd break you.

991
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,039
Darn it.

992
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:46,359
(Treenuch)

993
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,880
Hello. What's up?

994
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,649
I'm calling to ask how Mook is.

995
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:55,840
Fainting like that,
did she have to see a doctor?

996
01:24:56,529 --> 01:24:57,529
No.

997
01:24:58,119 --> 01:24:59,569
She's fine.

998
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:03,720
That's a relief. I was worried that
something was wrong with her.

999
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,479
Being in your care
must have made her feel better.

1000
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,119
I guess she wanted your attention.

1001
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,960
If you keep talking about Praomook,
I'll hang up the phone.

1002
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:13,239
Hold on, Lan.

1003
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:15,880
I want to talk to you.

1004
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,960
What do you want to talk about?

1005
01:25:20,529 --> 01:25:22,319
I want you to know

1006
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,569
that I still love you.

1007
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:29,840
Can you love me again?

1008
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:33,319
If you can,
even if I have to wait a year,

1009
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,359
I will wait for you.

1010
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,880
Well...

1011
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:45,319
Lan, open the door.

1012
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:48,439
Lan, open the door right now.

1013
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:51,279
Lan.

1014
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:52,800
What do you say?

1015
01:25:55,079 --> 01:25:56,359
Can you give us a chance

1016
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,399
to love each other again?

1017
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:00,609
Lan.

1018
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:04,279
Lan, open the door right now.

1019
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:05,920
Lan.

1020
01:26:06,529 --> 01:26:07,609
I've got to go.

1021
01:26:12,199 --> 01:26:14,479
That crazy woman
knows exactly when to turn up.

1022
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:18,279
Knocking on my door like that,
did someone die?

1023
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,239
What do you think you're doing?

1024
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:26,479
I will sleep in this room.

1025
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:28,920
You don't have my permission.
Get out.

1026
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:37,319
Oh, this feels nice.

1027
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Get up.

1028
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,760
No.

1029
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:49,279
Well, this bed is so snugly.
I'm starting to feel sleepy.

1030
01:26:52,649 --> 01:26:54,479
Will you get up yourself,
or do I have to make you?

1031
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:57,920
The bed is big. We can share it.

1032
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:01,840
What's wrong with
sharing a bed with your spouse?

1033
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,119
Is this how you want it?

1034
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,720
Alright.

1035
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,279
Hey.

1036
01:27:09,609 --> 01:27:12,720
- What are you doing?
- It's my bed. I will lie on it.

1037
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,159
Hey. Move over.

1038
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:21,960
- No.
- Hey.

1039
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,119
Hey. Stop. I'm about to fall off.

1040
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,039
No!

1041
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:29,680
Hey!

1042
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,439
Let me ask you something.

1043
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:37,239
Has it been so long that
you have to constantly seduce me?

1044
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:42,079
Although it's been a while,
I won't foolishly go for you.

1045
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:44,039
Just looking at your face
turns me off.

1046
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,760
Don't deny it.

1047
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,319
The mark on my neck
is proof that you want me.

1048
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,399
Which is why
you followed me to my room.

1049
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,760
I'm territorial.

1050
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,439
It's like putting a collar on a dog.

1051
01:27:58,479 --> 01:27:59,920
Are you calling me a dog?

1052
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:03,479
Yes. And you'll need a muzzle too

1053
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,039
because you seem to bark a lot.

1054
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:10,439
Do you want to try it?
I can give it to you.

1055
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,760
Hey, no.

1056
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,239
Don't do it.

1057
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:17,720
I don't want your dirty mouth
to leave a mark on me.

1058
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:21,960
Hey!

1059
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,279
What are you doing?

1060
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:30,920
Did you really think I would do it?

1061
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:34,079
I don't want to touch
a dirty woman like you.

1062
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,720
You can have this room if you want.

1063
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:48,840
I'm going to sleep with Rut
tonight anyway.

1064
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,279
Make yourself at home.

1065
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:39,720
You're in a dangerous situation.

1066
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,680
People who disappeared
from your life suddenly turned up.

1067
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,239
There are only a few reasons.

1068
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,279
I told you before. I came back

1069
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:49,199
to take back what belongs to me.

1070
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,520
Lan will be mine again.

1071
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,560
Endure it because
there's nothing else you can do.

1072
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:58,760
I don't play around with my life.

1073
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:01,039
Don't judge me
when you know nothing about me.

1074
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:03,159
I don't care if you don't
want to do it or not.

1075
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:04,439
All I care about is
getting the job done.

1076
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,640
Do whatever you want.
I don't care about you anymore.

1077
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,520
You're no different from them.

1078
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,760
Let go of me, Lan.
