1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,039
Congratulations. You successfully
convinced me to marry you.

4
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,560
Why does something that's
rightfully mine

5
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,530
have to be used
as a bargaining tool?

6
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,120
I pretended to be your lover
in front of people.

7
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,000
I ruined my playboy reputation
to stop your wedding.

8
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,759
How could you abandon me like this?

9
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,879
What's good about marrying
someone else's man?

10
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Let's live in peace.

11
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,319
When I fight with him,

12
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,199
I'll have you as my adviser.

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,639
Fine. If I want to be more,
I have to start at being her friend.

14
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,919
You can have that money
in exchange for Lan's freedom.

15
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,639
Cancel the wedding.

16
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,039
I may need money,
but I'm not a greedy person.

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,719
I'll stay the night here.

18
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,039
- Ting.
- Yes?

19
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,680
Please iron these clothes for me.

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,719
I tagged each one
to show who it belongs to.

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
- Alright.
- This one too.

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,360
By the way, where is Petch?

23
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,159
Well...

24
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,159
She left early this morning
and didn't say where she was going.

25
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,599
Oh well.

26
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,800
Hello, Mook. What's up?

27
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,719
Where are you?

28
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,719
I told you to help Mom
and to clean up.

29
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,319
I'm running an errand.

30
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,840
You seem to be
running errands every day.

31
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,840
Is it so bad being our house?

32
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,439
Is that all you want to say?
I can't talk right now.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
Just get back soon.

34
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,639
And call me if you're going to come
home late. I'll pick you up.

35
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,159
I can get home by myself.
Don't bother.

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,170
Petch, hello?

37
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,439
She hung up.

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,399
I don't know where she is. She is
always playing her stupid games.

39
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,050
You're such a nag.

40
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,560
If I were her, I would run away.

41
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,399
She should have at least
told me where she is.

42
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,920
What would I do
if something happened to her?

43
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,800
Basically, you're worried about her.

44
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,399
Why didn't you tell her that?
You are always like this.

45
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,279
Just say you're worried.
Just say you love her.

46
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,759
You don't have to be so guarded.

47
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,680
Anyway, I think you should...

48
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,519
You're noisy. Shut up.

49
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,519
- Is it good?
- Good.

50
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,360
You didn't tell your family
that you work here, did you?

51
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,680
Well...

52
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,279
Answer my question.

53
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
No, I didn't.

54
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,680
What you're doing isn't right.

55
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,360
You're under 18.

56
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,839
If you're coming to work,
you have to let your guardian know.

57
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,680
Don't tell them that
you're just running an errand.

58
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,519
If one day you go home late

59
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,879
and your family goes to the police,
my company will be in trouble.

60
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,800
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,399
Don't apologize to me.

62
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,480
What you should be doing is
telling your family about this.

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,240
If you don't want to do that,

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
would you like me to
tell your sister for you?

65
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,199
No, it's fine. I'll tell her myself.

66
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Poom.

67
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,680
- Poom.
- Yes, Boss.

68
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,600
How can I help you?

69
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,040
Tell human resources

70
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,839
to prepare a guardian consent form
for Nampetch's employment.

71
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
I'll give you a week.

72
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,160
If you don't have their signature
by then, you have two options.

73
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,480
Having me tell your guardian.

74
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,279
Or quitting your job.

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,199
I'm not quitting.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,439
Then get it done.

77
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,319
Poom.

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,399
Okay, I'll do that right away.

79
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,240
I hired you
because I saw your talent.

80
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
But if you have a problem
with your family

81
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,319
and drag my company into it,
I will have to dismiss you.

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
There are many other people
who want to work with me.

83
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,480
I don't need you.

84
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,639
Alright.

85
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,160
Wow.

86
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,839
Seeing his fury for the first time,
how do you feel?

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,319
He is so scary.

88
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,680
He can be worse.
You should get used to it.

89
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,120
This wouldn't have happened had you
told your family. Why didn't you?

90
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Doesn't your family
want you to work?

91
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
It's not like that.

92
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,920
A lot is going on with my family,
so I haven't told them yet.

93
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,360
Well, do it quickly.

94
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,759
My boss is sensitive
about matters like this.

95
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,600
And he is scared of minors.

96
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,480
Why is that?

97
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,560
He wants nothing to do with them

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,160
because he doesn't want to be jailed
for child abduction.

99
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
What?

100
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,360
Let's go. I'll get the form ready.

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,360
Have I made the wrong decision
using this kid to get to her sister?

102
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,800
(Game testing report
by Nampetch Wongnuannang)

103
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,960
List of bugs.

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,360
Stuttering when using skills.

105
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,330
Lowered resolution during a fight.

106
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,600
She is thorough.

107
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,090
At least she is useful.

108
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,799
Lan, you're just in time.

109
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,879
I got information from
the authorities in Korea.

110
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,919
What's wrong with you?
You seem exhausted now.

111
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,240
Did you go too hard?

112
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,450
Boss,

113
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,360
watch your language.
There's a minor around.

114
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,679
More like I got beat.

115
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,679
Can I stay with you tonight?
I don't want to see my parents.

116
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Alright.

117
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,279
Don't you want to get back with her?
She's giving you a chance.

118
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,480
I don't know. My instinct tells me
to wait and see.

119
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,799
What does your heart tell you?

120
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
You're corny.

121
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,799
I'm confused.

122
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't know the answer.

123
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,639
First love is hard to forget.

124
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,480
Still, you should be careful.

125
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,200
Nuch suddenly appeared
the day you got attacked.

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,720
I don't think she was involved.
Why would she do it?

127
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,799
I don't know.
We can't trust anyone at this point.

128
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,799
I suspect Nuch the same way
you suspect Mook.

129
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,159
I'm going to do a background check.

130
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:00,879
Alright.

131
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,240
What's wrong with Lan?

132
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
You're curious

133
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
or you're worried.

134
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,200
Both.

135
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
He is facing a love problem.
And I am too.

136
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,519
It's because of the wedding,
isn't it?

137
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,559
I don't want to talk about
my private life during work hours.

138
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
It's after work hours.

139
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,559
You can tell me
what's troubling you.

140
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,519
Think of me as your sister.

141
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,879
I don't want Lan to get married,
but I can't stop him.

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,559
I don't want that either.

143
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,399
Marriage must come from love.

144
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,919
Mook is a charming woman.

145
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Lan may fall in love with her
if he gets to spend time with her.

146
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,039
What will I do if that happens?

147
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,000
Trust him.

148
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,639
I guess that's all I can do.

149
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,480
I made my decision.

150
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,039
Oh, Petch.

151
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,919
Ting, where is my sister?

152
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,639
She is in the music room.

153
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,639
Oh.

154
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,919
What's up with her?

155
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,799
You can have that money
in exchange for Lan's freedom.

156
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,919
Cancel the wedding.

157
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Whatever reasons you have
for this marriage,

158
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
remember my words.

159
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,159
Don't take anything
that doesn't belong to you,

160
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,840
be it fame, wealth, or love.

161
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,320
Otherwise, you will be unhappy
for the rest of your life.

162
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,919
Mook, I need to talk to you.

163
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,240
What is it?

164
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,679
You have to cancel the wedding.

165
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,240
I can't do that. It's too late.

166
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
It's not too late.

167
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,399
You can call Uncle Lim
and tell him right now.

168
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No.

169
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,440
But you can't ruin
their relationship.

170
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,960
Lan and Marut love each other.

171
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
Please don't take Lan from Marut.

172
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,240
Do you really believe
that they're lovers?

173
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,080
It's obviously an act.

174
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,879
I believe it.
I'm sure they love each other.

175
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,360
You're still young.
You can't see through Lan's tricks.

176
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,799
I'm old enough to know what love is.

177
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,879
I know you've been in love with Lan
since you were a girl.

178
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,440
And you still love him.
That's why you want to marry him.

179
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,039
- I don't love him.
- I don't believe you.

180
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,360
You're trying to
separate him from Rut

181
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,320
by using our house as an excuse.

182
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,440
You want to beat Lan so much that
you don't care about other people.

183
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,600
Love is sacrifice, isn't it?

184
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,360
Please sacrifice yourself
for his happiness.

185
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,879
Stop talking nonsense.

186
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,320
That love you're talking about
doesn't exist.

187
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,960
You want me to
sacrifice myself, right?

188
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,600
Look. I'm doing it right now.

189
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm sacrificing my own happiness
for you and Mom.

190
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,919
Don't use me and Mom as excuses.

191
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,200
You're doing this for yourself.
You're selfish.

192
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,919
Alright. I'm selfish.

193
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,440
I don't care how he feels
or if he has a lover.

194
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,159
I only care about my own interests.
I'm a bad person. Are you happy?

195
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,720
I will be happy
only if you cancel the wedding.

196
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,519
I'm going to marry him
no matter what.

197
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,840
You're the exact opposite
of the name Dad gave you.

198
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,840
Praomook.

199
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,240
You have a beautiful name,

200
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,320
but you're behaving like
a worthless, despicable person.

201
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,890
If you've finished, you can leave.

202
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,240
No matter how hard you try,
he won't love you.

203
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,000
Petch was right.

204
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,170
I'm cheap,

205
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:23,680
worthless, and despicable.

206
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,200
I have nothing to be proud of.

207
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,480
Dad is probably wrong about me.

208
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,480
Mook,

209
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,319
don't think like that.

210
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,650
I understand you.

211
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,650
You're doing your best.

212
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,920
M,

213
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:32,319
I tried to stop Mook,
but she didn't listen.

214
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,680
I don't want her to get hurt.

215
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,799
If she loves Lan
and he can't love her back,

216
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,170
she will be the one who gets
hurt the most.

217
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,839
If you are going to marry someone,

218
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,480
don't do it for propriety
or appropriateness.

219
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,960
Those things don't exist.

220
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,359
You must pick someone you love
and who loves you back.

221
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,410
And you will be happy.

222
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,759
I have you and Mom
as my role models.

223
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,319
If I'm marrying someone
who hates me,

224
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,039
will I be happy?

225
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,170
Are you ready? They are almost here.

226
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,319
Let me see you.

227
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,170
My daughter is beautiful.

228
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,839
I'm sorry for doing this.

229
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,170
Are you disappointed in me?

230
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,119
You've never disappointed me.

231
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,960
I really appreciate
what you're doing for our family.

232
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,559
And no matter what happens,

233
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,680
remember that you have me,

234
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,000
your father, and your sister.

235
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,680
You're not alone.

236
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,599
I love you.

237
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,240
I love you too.

238
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,160
Come on. Don't cry.
You have to look pretty today.

239
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,279
Lim and Pat are here.

240
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Alright.

241
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,599
Could you check on Petch?

242
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,799
If she's ready,
tell her to welcome our guests.

243
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Alright.

244
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,359
Petch.

245
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,559
Petch.

246
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,319
Your mother wants you to welcome
the guests when you're ready.

247
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:35,839
- Your mother wants...
- Ting, I heard you.

248
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,599
Dear,

249
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,759
where is our son?
He is supposed to be here by now.

250
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
What if...

251
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,680
Lower your voice.

252
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,039
What if he is running away
from the wedding?

253
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,440
I don't think so.
He is a man of his word.

254
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Then why isn't he here yet?
It's almost time.

255
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:26,119
How would I know?
I'm as clueless as you are.

256
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,359
Gosh.

257
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,400
Lak, call your brother now.

258
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,839
If he doesn't want to come,
just let it be. No need to call him.

259
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,039
Lak, just called him.

260
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,359
Don't argue with me.
Call him immediately.

261
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,200
I'll do it for you.

262
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,880
Go ahead.

263
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,960
What's going on?

264
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,799
You will miss your ring ceremony.

265
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,319
I don't care.

266
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,079
Like your parents would allow that.

267
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,319
(Treenuch)

268
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,720
(Treenuch)

269
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,440
- Hello.
- Lan, help me.

270
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,960
Nuch, what's wrong?

271
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,119
My stomach hurts so much.
Can you take me to a doctor?

272
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,720
Hang in there, Nuch.

273
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,359
What's wrong?

274
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,000
- Dear.
- What?

275
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,480
- What do we do?
- I don't know. Just wait for him.

276
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,839
- He hasn't arrived yet.
- Look at the time.

277
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,920
- He will arrive.
- How can you be sure?

278
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,920
Danai, what did he say?

279
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,680
I can't get a hold of him.

280
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,240
He's so irresponsible.

281
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,440
What should we do?
It's almost time to exchange rings.

282
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,039
I know that.
Did you tell him the right time?

283
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,759
Danai, keep calling him.

284
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
- Don't stop calling him.
- Da.

285
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,440
Good morning.

286
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,960
Where is Lan?

287
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,519
He is on his way. The traffic
is bad. He will arrive shortly.

288
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,039
Anyway, is Mook ready?

289
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,400
Yes, she will probably
come down soon.

290
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,079
Alright. While we're waiting
for the groom and bride,

291
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,400
why don't we take some pictures
of us adults?

292
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:07,960
- Oak, could you take a photo of us?
- Of course.

293
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,200
- Come here.
- Da, sit down.

294
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,440
Got to look good.

295
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:19,279
- Alright.
- Ready? One, two, three.

296
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,640
I think he has run away.

297
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,440
He probably wants to
embarrass Mom and Dad.

298
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,799
He wouldn't do that.
Dad would be angry if he did.

299
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,680
Good. If Dad gets so mad that
he disowns him, that's even better.

300
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sure
Lan won't make it here in time.

301
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,920
Why do you think that?

302
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,480
I just have a hunch.

303
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,000
Mook, Mom wants you downstairs.
It's almost 09:09 a.m.,

304
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,880
but Lan hasn't arrived yet.

305
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
What?

306
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,160
I hope he doesn't stand us up.

307
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,839
If he doesn't show up, you won't
get your house back, right?

308
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
That's right.

309
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,039
Holy spirits, please help my friend.

310
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,960
Help her get a husband
and get her house back. Please.

311
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,720
I'm not joking around.

312
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,519
Lan, my stomach hurts.
Please take me to a doctor.

313
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
What is it?

314
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Lan.

315
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,680
Why did you have to
bring your friend?

316
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,319
He is my best man.

317
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,680
This is a family-only event. You
didn't have to bring your friend.

318
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,279
Right?

319
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,200
Come on, dear. Complain later.
It's almost time.

320
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,640
- Look at what he's doing.
- Stop.

321
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,480
Lan, go to Mook's side quickly.

322
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Please.

323
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you glad that I showed up?

324
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm glad that you didn't run away.

325
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,680
I'm a man of my word.

326
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,960
I came here for my own sake,
not yours.

327
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,279
Whatever your reason is,
this benefits me.

328
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,599
Alright, guys. Lan, it's 09:09 a.m.

329
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,240
Time to exchange rings.

330
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,559
From now on,
you will suffer with me.

331
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,200
It's your choice.

332
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,759
Right, it's my choice.

333
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,200
If I'm going to suffer,
you'll suffer with me.

334
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,440
Rut, are you alright?

335
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,079
I gave Treenuch some medicine.

336
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,839
She will be fine. She seems healthy.

337
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:16,400
Lan, my stomach hurts.
Please take me to a doctor.

338
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,519
Lan told me to bring you medicine.

339
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,039
Darn it.

340
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,840
Rut.

341
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,679
Are you alright?

342
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:01,880
I'm fine.

343
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,719
Your eyes and nose are red.

344
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,960
You're close to tears.

345
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,000
Are you crying?

346
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,289
Please don't cry.

347
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,079
Don't cry.

348
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,960
Rut.

349
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,289
Rut.

350
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,159
What is it?

351
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,519
I'm on your side.

352
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,809
If you're upset or if
anything happens, you can tell me.

353
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,119
I will help you if I can.

354
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:13,289
You'll help me?

355
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,559
With everything?

356
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,719
Yes.

357
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,960
You gave me your word.

358
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,639
- Deal.
- Deal.

359
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,519
I feel better now.

360
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,559
Let's get inside.

361
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:56,519
Please.

362
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:48,880
Poor him.

363
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Rut must be very upset.

364
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:07,559
Congratulations.

365
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,769
Welcome to our family.

366
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Thank you.

367
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,840
One more picture. Smile.

368
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,920
It's done. Excuse me.

369
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,719
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

370
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,199
Thank you.

371
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:41,880
This is what you want.

372
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,639
Are you happy?

373
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:53,329
No. You still have three more
photoshoots to do

374
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,119
to honor this day.

375
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,559
I don't want to...

376
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,079
change my outfit.

377
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,440
Mook, could you change
your clothes then?

378
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,119
Okay.

379
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Are you happy now?

380
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
No.

381
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,360
Not until we send you to
the bridal chamber.

382
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,679
- Bridal chamber?
- That's right.

383
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,400
This is just a mock wedding.

384
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:38,199
Why do we have to
enter the bridal chamber?

385
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:42,159
Well, you're married now.
You must stay together.

386
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:44,239
You even registered your marriage.

387
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,880
You must live together and care for
each other just like other couples.

388
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,289
But I think doing the ceremony
and marriage registration

389
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,159
is enough to improve his fortune.

390
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:59,199
I agree.
I think this is more than enough.

391
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:02,199
- You should do the whole thing.
- Right.

392
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,079
Da, here is the thing.

393
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,239
The fortuneteller said it'd be best
for Lan if he can be with Mook.

394
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,809
They will complement each other.

395
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,039
And he will get through
any adversity.

396
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,519
Please, Da. I'm begging you.

397
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,079
Mom, don't worry.

398
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,719
After the bridal chamber ceremony,
we'll go our separate ways.

399
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,639
We'll stay in our own rooms.

400
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,559
You go alone.

401
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
I'd rather do it with Rut

402
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,480
than be in the same room with you.

403
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,960
Right, babe?

404
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
You have to enter
the bridal chamber.

405
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:58,519
After that,
you will get whatever you want.

406
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,599
It's fine if you don't dare
to be in the same room with me.

407
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,480
Alright, I'll do it.

408
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,679
Don't forget our agreement, Dad.

409
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,599
I hope you can do as you say.

410
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,840
If you can't,

411
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,639
you will get nothing.

412
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,199
I wish you two the best.

413
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,809
Try to be forgiving
toward each other.

414
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,400
Lan, look after my daughter for me.

415
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,719
I think your daughter can look after
herself. She doesn't need anyone.

416
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,159
Thank you, Mom.

417
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,639
Thank her.

418
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,119
Alright, my turn.

419
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,760
Mook, please take care of my son
and get him on the right track.

420
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,519
Don't let him get out of line
and be up to no good.

421
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,440
Most of all, try to stop him
from being a bum.

422
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm not a bum, Dad.

423
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,639
What you are is an unreliable bum.

424
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,880
Anyway, now that you're married,
you have to be more responsible

425
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,920
despite the fact that
this is a mock marriage.

426
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,199
Don't forget

427
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,599
that you have legally
registered the marriage.

428
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,199
This means you are bound to
look after each other.

429
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,039
- Alright, I'll give my blessing.
- Go ahead.

430
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,960
I hope you two

431
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,840
stay together and do your best
to take care of each other.

432
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,360
Be patient.

433
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,440
When you face an obstacle,
try to work together to overcome it.

434
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,599
I think the bride and groom
must be tired now.

435
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:57,639
- Let's allow them to rest
- Alright.

436
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,440
and leave them be.

437
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:01,280
- Come on. Let's go.
- Good.

438
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Get some rest.

439
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,519
Congratulations.

440
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,360
Come on. Let's go.

441
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,559
Da, now that we're a family,

442
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,679
I will treat her as my own daughter.
You have nothing to worry about.

443
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,280
Listen, if they have a baby,

444
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,159
we'll have an adorable grandkid.

445
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,559
Pat, this is just a mock marriage.

446
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,519
It will be over after a year.

447
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,480
I don't think
that will be necessary.

448
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,519
- Oh, come on.
- Well.

449
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,079
I agree with you. Dear,
you're getting ahead of yourself.

450
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,920
It's just that now they're married.

451
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,920
I want them to stay together and
have babies if that's possible.

452
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,360
I'm just being a little hopeful.

453
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,199
Dear, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

454
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,039
For now, let's see if tonight

455
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:06,039
Mook and Lan will kill each other

456
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,320
or love each other to death.

457
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,079
We'll sleep separately. I sleep
on the bed. You sleep on the floor.

458
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:19,000
No, I sleep on the bed.

459
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,599
- This is my bed.
- Don't act like a child.

460
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,880
I have the same right
as you do in this house.

461
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,440
Be honest with me.

462
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,920
Are you asking to sleep separately
because you're scared of yourself?

463
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:31,039
I'm not scared. I'm disgusted.

464
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,800
I already feel dirty
being around a woman like you.

465
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,519
This feels so nice.

466
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Oh.

467
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,840
Looks like I dirtied your bed.

468
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,159
I guess you can't stay here tonight.
Why don't you go somewhere else?

469
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,679
Brat.

470
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,679
You have to enter
the bridal chamber.

471
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:42,840
After that,
you will get whatever you want.

472
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,760
Alright, I'll do it.

473
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,119
Don't forget our agreement, Dad.

474
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,280
I hope you can do as you say.

475
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,960
If you can't,

476
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,119
you will get nothing.

477
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,079
It's fine if you don't dare
to be in the same room with me.

478
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,880
You're trying to seduce me.

479
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,119
Is it working?

480
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
No.

481
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,880
Your body is mediocre.
I don't find it sexy at all.

482
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,559
Other men are more tempting.

483
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,000
You have a dirty mouth.

484
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,400
So do you.

485
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,920
Hey!

486
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
I told you I don't like women.

487
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,559
But it doesn't mean
that I can't get excited.

488
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,679
If you want it so much,
I can give it to you.

489
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,440
Hey!

490
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:47,320
What are you doing? Let go.

491
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,039
We've come this far.
Let's just get it over with.

492
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,039
You have fun, I have fun.

493
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,599
Let go. Aren't you scared I will try
to trap you if we go too far?

494
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,119
You can't trap me.

495
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,119
What happens after this
is lust, not love.

496
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,159
I will teach you how it feels
to be in a living hell.

497
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:13,159
Hey!

498
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,199
I won't go to hell with you.

499
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,320
But if you want to go to heaven,
I can take you there.

500
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,360
You're so audacious.

501
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:23,920
You must have been with a lot of men
to be this experienced.

502
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,119
Do you want to try?

503
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:27,960
I will make you forget about Rut.

504
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,679
Rut is my lover.

505
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,719
You're just a temporary plaything

506
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,440
to satisfy my lust. You're worthless

507
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,320
and disposable.

508
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:43,159
Do you want to find out
if I can impress you?

509
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,400
I might turn out to be reusable.

510
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,239
Or we could have a baby tonight.

511
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:52,199
The one-year agreement
will be useless

512
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:54,880
because you have to
be stuck with me forever.

513
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,400
You will never be
the mother of my baby.

514
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,119
Get away from me.

515
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:09,400
Why? This is just a beginning.

516
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,840
Are you shy? Nervous?

517
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,840
Or maybe you're just a loser.

518
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,679
I'm not a loser. I just
don't want to be trapped by you.

519
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,440
How unfortunate. I thought we'd
be having fun all night long.

520
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,800
Let me know if you change your mind.

521
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,199
I'm always ready.

522
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,679
Do you want to shower with me?

523
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,760
I'm lonely. I could use the company.

524
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,039
No.

525
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,679
- He almost got you.
- She almost got you.

526
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,840
Remember, Mook. This is just a game.

527
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:14,360
Don't give in.

528
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,800
In this game, you must win.

529
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
M,

530
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,320
Rut must be very upset to see
his lover marrying another woman.

531
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,079
He must be heartbroken.

532
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,960
Thanks.

533
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:10,079
You know you're allergic to flowers
and yet you still got close to them.

534
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,679
Be careful next time.
It's inconvenient for others.

535
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,960
If it's inconvenient for you,
don't go to work tomorrow then.

536
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,960
And leave my house.
I don't want to inconvenience you.

537
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:25,239
Oh, Boss.
You're not an inconvenience at all.

538
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,800
It's my pleasure.

539
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,079
Do you want more medicine?
I can get it for you.

540
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Wait.

541
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,199
About your assignment,
what did you find?

542
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,119
See who Treenuch is living with.

543
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,400
I suspect that she's involved
in Lan's accident.

544
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,119
If you find nothing,
you're dead, Poom.

545
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
What do you want?

546
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,360
Do you feel better?

547
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,559
Lan told me to take you to a doctor
if your stomach still hurts.

548
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,880
That won't be necessary.
I feel better now.

549
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,719
I think you should at least
get checked out by a doctor.

550
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,960
I said I'm fine. Go away.

551
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,159
This is my card.

552
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,039
Call me if your condition worsens.

553
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,519
Go.

554
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,000
I'll get reprimanded if I give you
information on the tenants.

555
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:50,519
It's fine. I don't want you
to be in trouble.

556
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,239
But I think giving you
a few details won't hurt.

557
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,039
The cleaning lady said
she lives alone.

558
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,800
A man, probably her boyfriend,
visits her sometimes.

559
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,639
But he hasn't visited her recently.

560
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:09,599
Maybe they broke up.

561
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,639
Do you have information on the man?

562
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,920
No.

563
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,639
He mostly visits her at night.
The lady is off duty by then.

564
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,119
She walked into him before,
but she didn't see his face.

565
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,719
I want information on this man.

566
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:28,400
I want to know who he is
and if he is connected with Lan.

567
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,079
Tell me if you find out
anything else.

568
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,360
You got it, Boss.

569
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,599
Lan will be mine again.

570
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,719
I will get close to her

571
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,400
and try to find out if she is
connected with the attacker.

572
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:22,679
What's her passcode?

573
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,440
Her birthday?

574
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,519
Maybe it's Pethai's birthday.

575
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,599
Or Da's.

576
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:51,760
Or mine.

577
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,440
Wait, it can't be.

578
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,159
Why are you messing with my phone?

579
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Answer me.

580
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,599
I'm looking for
evidence against you.

581
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,159
Evidence against me. For what?

582
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,599
For ordering attacks on me,

583
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,360
and for making up stories
to get me to marry you.

584
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:36,199
Besides being useless,

585
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,519
you are an annoying
pessimistic, nit-picking man.

586
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:41,280
Has your brain ever thought
about positive things?

587
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:44,400
Or maybe it hasn't
because you don't have a brain.

588
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,840
Are you saying I'm stupid?

589
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,760
I'm not saying that. You are.

590
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,679
I have a brain.

591
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,880
And I can see through your plan.
I just don't have any proof.

592
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,679
I see. You want proof.

593
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,400
Go ahead then.
I can't wait for this to be over.

594
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,239
- Did you find anything?
- No.

595
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,320
You won't find anything

596
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,320
because I've never
thought of harming you.

597
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,800
Are you happy? Now, give it back.

598
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,519
Just because I can't find proof
doesn't mean there isn't any.

599
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,800
I won't stop here.

600
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:38,719
Whatever you please.

601
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,440
Hey.

602
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,800
I told you I'm not sharing
my bed with you.

603
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,519
Then you have to go somewhere else,
because I'm taking this bed.

604
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,280
But this is my bed.

605
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,880
But we're married.
What's yours is mine.

606
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,320
So I'm going to sleep on this bed.
Are we clear?

607
00:58:58,639 --> 00:58:59,639
Hey.

608
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,679
Oh, do you want to pick up
where we left off earlier?

609
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:08,639
No.

610
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:10,280
Then go to sleep.

611
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,000
Good night, my beloved husband.

612
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:43,760
Turn off the lights, baby.

613
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,480
It's late. Let's go to bed.

614
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,159
You can go ahead.
I have something I need to do.

615
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,239
You can leave it for tomorrow.

616
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:15,440
I want to hold you tonight.

617
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:18,280
Danai.

618
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,840
I said I'm working.
Don't disturb me.

619
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,360
Lak, this isn't office hours.

620
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,599
I want to spend time with you.

621
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,159
Can you put it off until later?

622
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,119
I have to finish this.

623
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,960
You too. It's the end of the quarter
and you haven't reached your target.

624
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,400
Have you found a way
to promote sales?

625
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,159
Alright.

626
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:48,519
You can work if you want to.
I'll go to sleep.

627
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,599
And don't worry about my job.
I can take care of it.

628
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,159
I have to worry.
You have to do your best.

629
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,599
That way, Dad will see that you're
capable of running the company.

630
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:04,199
I know what I have to do

631
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,239
to please you and your dad.

632
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,440
You know, but I don't see you
doing anything.

633
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
This is why he insists on
handing the company over to Lan.

634
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:16,960
If you're as good as you claim,
show me before we lose everything.

635
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,960
Good night.

636
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:25,920
I have to work in the morning.

637
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,280
Don't stay up too late.

638
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
What?

639
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,480
Duckling.

640
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
Hey.

641
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,239
Come on.

642
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,119
Come on.

643
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,719
Hey, duckling. Wake up.

644
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:28,599
Hey.

645
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,519
Lan.

646
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,880
Let's pick up where we left off.

647
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What?

648
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,480
Get off.

649
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,039
Lan,

650
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,920
go to sleep.

651
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,599
Don't wake up.

652
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:23,800
Go to sleep.

653
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,760
I can't do this anymore.

654
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:51,599
Oh!

655
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,960
Brat, she is even
a pervert in her sleep.

656
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:45,679
What?

657
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:45,800
(Limpichat)

658
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,840
(Praomook)

659
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,639
Here.

660
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,880
Good.

661
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,719
This is nice.

662
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,880
Alright. Here.

663
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,880
Mook, I handled your debt for you.

664
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:08,800
If you stay married
to my son for a year,

665
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,719
this house will be yours once again.

666
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,760
Thank you so much for your help.

667
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,079
That's not it.

668
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,320
I should thank you
for helping my family.

669
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,800
To be honest with you, this marriage
isn't just about removing bad luck.

670
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:33,440
I believe

671
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,760
you can make my son

672
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:39,599
become a better man.

673
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,360
You might be expecting
too much from me.

674
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,159
Your son won't listen to me.

675
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,440
You never know.

676
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:49,800
Anything can happen.

677
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:56,199
Listen. I want you to convince him
to work at my company.

678
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,679
Please do it
for my and my wife's sake.

679
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:02,719
Alright.

680
01:07:03,159 --> 01:07:07,000
It's a year starting from today.
you have to be very patient.

681
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:10,440
Lan will definitely try
to give you trouble.

682
01:07:11,559 --> 01:07:15,320
Okay. I'll be patient
with everything.

683
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:32,159
What did Dad talk to you about?

684
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:39,360
What's in the envelope?

685
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,679
It's the marriage certificate.
Uncle wants me to keep it.

686
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,639
Why do you want to keep it?
You will divorce after a year

687
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,360
and this certificate will be
just a piece of paper anyway.

688
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,519
I know that.

689
01:07:57,559 --> 01:07:59,760
This marriage happened
because of a prophecy.

690
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,480
You should live quietly.

691
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,719
Don't worry. After the agreement
is complete, I will get a divorce.

692
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,559
As long as you're in this house,

693
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,159
I will never be at ease.
Remember that.

694
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,199
If you touch
my family's possessions,

695
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,439
I will do something about it.

696
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,199
(Guardian consent form)

697
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,880
Do you have to work late?
What time do you get off?

698
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,199
I work ten to five.

699
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,680
No more than eight hours a day.
No overtime.

700
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,399
No work from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

701
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,319
If I have to go off-site,
the firm will inform you in advance.

702
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:03,880
You can stay at home and help me
if you want to work.

703
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,529
I'll give you a commission.

704
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,609
No, Mom. Listen.

705
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,399
Mom, I want this job, please.

706
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,840
Why? Do you want to
help me with money?

707
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:21,920
Your sister is married.
Our house is safe now.

708
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,479
I want to prove to her

709
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,199
that I can make money with games.
She just sees it as nonsense.

710
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,840
Look, if I get to work here,

711
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,439
I can make my own games
in the future.

712
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,720
Please let me do this job.

713
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:38,880
I don't want to
miss this opportunity.

714
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:43,800
Besides, the company's owner
is Marut, Lan's lover,

715
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,920
no, Lan's friend.
You met him before.

716
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:58,119
You will work during school break.

717
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,880
When school starts,
you have to focus on your studies.

718
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:03,279
And make sure
to take care of yourself.

719
01:10:03,569 --> 01:10:07,159
The working world is very different
from the school world.

720
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:10,569
I promise I will do my best
to take care of myself.

721
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:17,649
Here.

722
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,569
Thank you, Mom.

723
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,119
Yay!

724
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,840
What?

725
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,079
Mook!

726
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:40,609
Wait.

727
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:42,399
It won't come off.

728
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:05,529
Wait for my turn, duckling.

729
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,680
What are you doing?

730
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:41,609
Nothing.

731
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:43,569
I saw it.

732
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,840
Did you hide something in there?

733
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:49,529
I didn't hide anything.

734
01:12:51,479 --> 01:12:52,529
I don't believe you.

735
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,199
It's obvious that
you're hiding something.

736
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,569
No. I don't like it
that you don't trust me.

737
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:06,159
You were seeing things.

738
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,649
If you don't believe me,
we'll stay like this all day.

739
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,529
I'm much stronger than you.

740
01:13:14,569 --> 01:13:16,159
I have to find out
what you're hiding.

741
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:21,119
Duckling!

742
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:22,649
What's wrong with you?

743
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:25,529
Get off.

744
01:13:26,279 --> 01:13:27,279
You want it?

745
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:44,529
Alright.

746
01:13:46,609 --> 01:13:47,609
Move.

747
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:49,199
- Move.
- Hey!

748
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:57,199
So, did you find anything?

749
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:00,199
No. Where did you hide it?

750
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,279
There was nothing to find
from the start. You're delusional.

751
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:16,399
Hey.

752
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,239
Your boyfriend is calling. Take it.

753
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,279
Hey, Rut.

754
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:29,720
- You want to speak with Lan, right?
- Yes.

755
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,079
I changed my mind though.

756
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,319
I want to speak with you instead.

757
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,039
Why? Just talk to me.

758
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:43,800
I won't bother you now.
Talk to you later, Rut.

759
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Hold on.

760
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,960
Why are you calling me?

761
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:39,119
Was everything okay last night?

762
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:43,119
Absolutely not.
I barely slept last night.

763
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,199
What do you mean?

764
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:47,840
Don't tell me that you and Mook...

765
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:49,680
She disturbed me all night.

766
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:52,000
- Disturbed you all night?
- That's right.

767
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,399
She kept trying to take my space.
I couldn't sleep because of that.

768
01:15:59,479 --> 01:16:00,960
You didn't finish your sentence.

769
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:05,609
Did you think I hooked up with her?

770
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:07,359
Never.

771
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:10,800
Even if she was the only woman left
in this world, I would never do it.

772
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:14,800
Good. Just don't
go back on your word.

773
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,880
I won't.
Is that all you want to say?

774
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:19,359
I'm hanging up.

775
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,079
Mook.

776
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,720
Have you thought about where
you'd like to go for your honeymoon?

777
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,319
There won't be a honeymoon.

778
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,439
What? You're supposed to go on
a honeymoon after the wedding.

779
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:53,000
This is just a mock marriage.

780
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,279
Just getting Lan to agree to enter
the bridal chamber is good enough.

781
01:16:56,529 --> 01:17:00,279
If we went on a honeymoon,
he would go crazy.

782
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,359
Lan, where are you going?

783
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:08,720
Have breakfast with us.
Mook is waiting for you.

784
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,359
I'm not hungry.

785
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:15,279
Wait. Where are you headed?

786
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,079
Whom are you asking?

787
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,239
I'm asking a dog, I guess.

788
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,880
Ouch.

789
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,399
He is asking you. Right, dear?

790
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,920
That's right.

791
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
It's none of your business.

792
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,720
Well.

793
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:41,319
You will not go anywhere else today

794
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:44,880
because you have to go to work
at the company with Mook.

795
01:17:50,649 --> 01:17:51,649
I'm not going.

796
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:54,920
If your daughter-in-law wants to
go there, she can go by herself.

797
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:56,720
I'm going out.

798
01:17:57,159 --> 01:17:59,199
Hey, wait.

799
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:02,319
- You must go. This is an order.
- Uncle.

800
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:05,439
I'll handle him.
I enjoy the challenge.

801
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,279
What do you want?

802
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,720
You have to go to work with me.

803
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,840
No, I won't.

804
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,439
If you don't come with me,
I'm going take over the company

805
01:18:30,569 --> 01:18:33,880
and take all of your possessions.

806
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:41,199
Are you a leech
trying to bleed people dry?

807
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:43,439
I'm a human.

808
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,279
A human who is ready
to take everything from you.

809
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,079
Do you think your threat
can make me go to work with you?

810
01:18:50,569 --> 01:18:51,649
It's a simple trick.

811
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,609
Do whatever you want.

812
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:56,649
But if you actually do it,
Lak will kill you.

813
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:58,720
What are you running away from?

814
01:18:59,479 --> 01:19:01,800
You've dismissed
your parents' concern.

815
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,760
You refuse to go to work even though
it will be yours eventually.

816
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,399
You live your life aimlessly.
You have no passion.

817
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,239
You act like you have nothing left
even though you have everything.

818
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:15,720
Why are you doing this?
Are you running away from something?

819
01:19:17,479 --> 01:19:18,529
It's none of your business.

820
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:21,800
Your business is my business now.

821
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:24,569
Just tell me what you want.

822
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:27,920
I'm sure you have your reasons
for not working at the company.

823
01:19:28,039 --> 01:19:29,800
You've refused it so clearly.

824
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:33,649
But if you don't talk,
nobody will know what you want.

825
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,279
Just tell me. Maybe I can help you.

826
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,279
I don't have to tell you.

827
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:47,880
You aren't important enough to me
to know what's going on in my life.

828
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,800
Lan, I haven't finished.

829
01:20:23,529 --> 01:20:24,800
I have.

830
01:20:25,649 --> 01:20:29,319
Open the door. If you won't tell me,
then you have to come with me.

831
01:20:35,609 --> 01:20:36,960
Get out of the car now.

832
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,079
Are you crazy running
in front of my car like that?

833
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,439
I haven't finished talking.
I won't let you leave.

834
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,359
- Oh.
- Hey.

835
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:50,319
Duckling!

836
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,960
Duckling!

837
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,119
Look where you’re going, silly.

838
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,960
You completely spaced out.

839
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:06,609
Are you okay?

840
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:08,399
I'm fine.

841
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:12,159
Be careful next time.

842
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:13,800
Don't get lost in your own world.

843
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:16,720
If you were on the street,
you would've gotten hit by a car.

844
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:33,609
Are you worried about me?

845
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,680
I'm not worried about you. I just
don't someone to die at my house.

846
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,279
If you want to die,
do it somewhere else.

847
01:22:46,649 --> 01:22:48,960
Well then, I'm sorry
that I'm completely fine.

848
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,359
Then move. If you do this again,

849
01:22:52,529 --> 01:22:55,960
I will hit you with my car.
Don't call me heartless.

850
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,920
You won't do it.

851
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:02,800
Do you want to find out? Now move!

852
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:05,279
You're going to work with me
no matter what.

853
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:09,119
A useless duckling like you
can't force me.

854
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:11,119
We'll see.

855
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,960
What are you doing?

856
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:16,720
Hey, duckling!

857
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,279
What are you doing?

858
01:23:21,159 --> 01:23:22,279
What are you playing at?

859
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:25,159
I'm not playing. I'm serious.

860
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:26,920
You forced my hand.

861
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:30,239
You can go wherever you want.
But you won't have these.

862
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,119
Don't test me.

863
01:23:32,439 --> 01:23:34,569
I'm not testing you. I'm serious.

864
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,920
Go if you want.

865
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:39,159
But if you want these back,
you'll have to get them at work.

866
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:47,079
If you want them, come and get them.

867
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:56,960
Darn it.

868
01:23:57,439 --> 01:23:59,359
Brat, don't think I'm scared of you.

869
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,680
Look. You really want me
to go to work, don't you?

870
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:10,960
Yes, it's just work.
What's the big deal?

871
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:14,479
Alright.

872
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,960
There you go.

873
01:24:36,609 --> 01:24:37,609
Wait.

874
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,039
Give me my stuff back.

875
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:44,649
No. I'll return them after work.

876
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:47,649
Give them to me,
or I will use force.

877
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,680
Go ahead. Use force if you want.
You aren't a man.

878
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:55,960
I will be kind to those
who deserve it.

879
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:58,199
And you don't deserve it.

880
01:24:58,649 --> 01:25:01,119
You hurt me, I hurt you.
You're mean to me, I'm mean to you.

881
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,479
I wonder how mean you can be.

882
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,880
I'll give you one last chance.
Give me back my stuff.

883
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,119
Come and take them

884
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,199
if you dare.

885
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:26,960
Hey, Lan! What are you doing?

886
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:28,439
- Give me.
- No!

887
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,880
Lan!

888
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,529
Hey, no! Lan!

889
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,960
Get off!

890
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:44,569
Why? Are you turned on?

891
01:25:45,649 --> 01:25:48,000
You get excited easily.

892
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,319
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't feel anything.

893
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:06,239
I should be the one saying that.
I don't feel anything.

894
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:10,720
Are you a dog?
You're good at biting.

895
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,529
I should teach you a lesson.

896
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:24,529
Get it together.
You can't feel anything for him.

897
01:26:24,649 --> 01:26:26,279
Praomook, stop.

898
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:28,760
Duckling, stop.

899
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:33,239
Why? Do you miss me?

900
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,119
Let's make a deal.

901
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,159
I want my phone back.

902
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:42,079
You can return my wallet
and car key after work.

903
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,319
How can I be sure that
you won't sneak out of work?

904
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,760
You can pay for things
using your phone.

905
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,960
You can call a taxi with an app.
I'm not falling for that.

906
01:26:54,529 --> 01:26:56,720
I've come all the way here.
I'll work for the day.

907
01:26:57,439 --> 01:26:58,439
Give it back.

908
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:01,960
Come on.

909
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,960
No.

910
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:08,760
You have to go to work now.
Time to stop playing around.

911
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,199
Let's go to work, baby.

912
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,079
You're not afraid to show
your affection at work, are you?

913
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:30,960
Nuch.

914
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,479
That's right. It's me.

915
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,640
It's nice to see you again, Lan.

916
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,640
Mook.

917
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:10,560
I just want to find out
if I can rekindle an old flame.

918
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,880
It's Treenuch who can
get them to fight each other.

919
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:16,319
Then Mook will finally
leave our family alone.

920
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,359
I'm not seeing anyone right now.

921
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,159
Lan is mine and mine alone.

922
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:25,720
What about his heart? Is it yours?

923
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,560
You have the same dirty mouth.

924
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,000
- Mook!
- Go ahead.

925
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:32,880
I will hit you right back.
An eye for an eye.

926
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,840
I'm not the same Praomook.

927
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,039
I won't lose this time.

928
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,119
It's your fault that Dad is sick
and Mom is struggling.

929
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,479
It's all your fault. You...
