00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,229
Please allow Yu Xixi to see Yu Zhao.

7
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,660
After that, you can punish me all you want.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,370
You like Yu Xixi,

9
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,600
but you came to ask me to allow her to see Yu Zhao.

10
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,230
Do you think it's worth it?

11
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,700
I just think

12
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,330
that I owe it to Yu Xixi.

13
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,560
So I wanted to fulfill her one last wish.

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,700
Bastard!

15
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,789
All you know is love.

16
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,449
Please allow her to see Yu Zhao.

17
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,110
After this, I won't see Yu Xixi ever again.

18
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,790

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,079
Fine.

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
I'll allow her to see Yu Zhao.

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,560
Thank you, Father.

24
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,670
Please punish me, Father.

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,950
I hope you can keep your promise.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,579

your condescension.

30
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,310
Do you think you're the center

Yu, what do you mean by that?

36
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,110
She is from the Yu family.

37
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,829
You can't touch her.

38
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,190

Of course.

64
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,030
Does it hurt?

65
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,270
I'm fine.

66
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,950

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,980
I don't want to see you.

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Nothing.

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,710
I just don't want to see you.

71
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,720
Why?

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,480
Because I'm Feng Zihe,

73
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,300
not Yu Zhao.

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,470
I know it's all because of my willfulness.

76
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,030
If I hadn't insisted on holding the Martial Arts Competition,

77
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,200
things wouldn't have turned out like this.

78
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,810
Don't worry.

79
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,080
I'll get you out of here.

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,160
You get me out of here?

81
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,950
How?

82
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,630
I'm a part of the martial arts world.

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,660
You are not.

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
We are people from different worlds.

85
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,070
Let me tell you again.

86
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,310
I'm Feng Zihe,

87
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,670
not Yu Zhao.

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,930
Leave me alone.

89
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,070
How can I leave you alone?

90
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,090
What are you going to do?

91
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,390
Yes.

92
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,290
I know I'm childish,

93
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,400
and I know I was wrong.

94
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,670
But we've been through so much.

95
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,270
It's all fake.

96
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,630
Fake?

97
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,510
Those experiences you had were with Yu Zhao,

98
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,590
not with me.

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,830
I'm the eldest son of the Golden Blade Sect.

100
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,909
I'm the Demon Boy.

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,970
I must save you, no matter what.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,990
Whether you are Yu Zhao or Feng Zihe,

103
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,870
what we have is true.

104
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,150
Do you know?

105
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,430
When we were little,

106
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,420
I really hated you.

107
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,870
I always found you to be so annoying.

108
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,230
You always meddled in my affairs.

109
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,590
But later,

110
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,750
Mom sent you away from Xianyun City to toughen up.

111
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,350
So we were apart.

112
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,040
Until one year,

113
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,560
you went back to town for business,

114
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,550
and we reunited.

115
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,430
At that time,

116
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,350
I didn't realize that you were Yu Zhao,

117
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,550
who always told me what to do or not to do.

118
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,820
I was drawn to you at that moment.

119
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,890
Later,

120
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,370
Mom passed away,

121
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,590
and we got engaged for no reason.

122
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,630
At first, I was very happy.

123
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,990
But later,

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,550
I didn't expect you to be so possessive.

125
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,510
You became stricter and stricter with me.

126
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,830
I grew to hate you more and more

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,560
Actually, I've always hated you.

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,920
But I don't know why.

129
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,090
The more I hate you,

130
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,970
the more I find myself thinking about you.

131
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,920
The more I hate you, the more I find myself thinking about you.

132
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,870
Am I crazy?

133
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,820
But now,

134
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,630
I don't hate you anymore.

135
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,590
I want you to tell me what to do,

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,820
but you left me alone.

137
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,150
Yun said

138
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,360
that love is not something you say,

139
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,310
but something you feel.

140
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,420
Whether you are Yu Zhao

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,030
or Feng Zihe,

142
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,700
I want to tell you

143
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,620
that I seem to fall in love with you.

144
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,240
What about you?

145
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,190
Do you love me?

146
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,830
Don't be silly, okay?

147
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,670
I've never loved you.

148
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,230
If I have given you the wrong ideas,

149
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,030
it only means you're stupid.

150
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,310
I was just using you to hide my identity.

151
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,010
By the way,

152
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,630
this is our engagement announcement.

153
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,950

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,620
Miss, have some water.

189
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,710
The world may be covered in blood once more.

190
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,550
What's wrong?

191
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,510
Do you have any water? Give me some water.

192
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,270
Haven't you heard?

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,950
You have some too.

194
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,440
Yesterday, the Martial Arts Competition

195
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,790
was held at the Huixian Restaurant.

196
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,300
The manager of Huixian Restaurant

197
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,810
was taken away by people from Lu Ming Manor.

198
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:40,980
Why?

199
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,680
I heard that the manager

200
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,750
is the Demon Boy.

201
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,000
Demon Boy?

202
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,740
Right.

203
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
Let me tell you.

204
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,470
What did you say?

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,040
Who told you about "Demon Boy"?

206
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,970
I heard it at the inn.

207
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,110
Mengniang, how much money do we have left?

208
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,730
That's all.

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Okay.

210
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,460
Driver, we'd like to go back to Huixian Restaurant.

211
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
This is all the money we have.

212
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,030
Miss asked me to give this to you.

213
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,990
Miss said

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,630
that if you can't come back,

215
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,220
she won't want the jade either.

216
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,830
She's waiting for you to come back

217
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,200
and marry her with this jade.

218
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,390
Take good care of her.

219
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Yes, Young Master.

220
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,850
Is everything okay?

221
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,790
Don’t worry, Master.

222
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,000
Everything is ready.

223
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,330
Just in case,

224
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,710
we sealed their acupoints.

225
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,980
They are now ordinary people.

226
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,110
Okay.

227
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,810
Let's go.

228
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,410
Yes.

229
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,980
Yu Zhao should have left by now.

230
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,320
Huo.

231
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,190
I will come back to save you.

232
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,820
[Yu Mansion]

233
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,110
Bride and groom, please come forward.

234
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,430
Bow to heaven and earth.

235
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,510
If only I had married Yu Zhao.

236
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,390
Bow to your parents.

237
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,210
♫Fireworks lighting up in the sky♫

238
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,620
Bow to each other.

239
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,850
♫Whose love is it?♫

240
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:46,010
♫A flashing epiphyllum♫

241
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,690
The ceremony is complete.

242
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,620
♫Ask, don't wait until the flowers fall♫

243
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,960
♫But who knows the answer?♫

244
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,880
♫Just fall♫

245
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,680
♫How can I get closer?♫

246
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,270
♫How can I smile?♫

247
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,880
♫Where you look back in the lights♫

248
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,990
♫Flowers bloom♫

249
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,720
I was so silly.

250
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,530
He just wanted to keep me by his side.

251
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,960
♫How can I remember it?♫

252
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,560
♫How can I forget it?♫

253
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,840
♫I'm afraid I can never see you again♫

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,380
♫How to remember it?♫

255
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,950
If I hadn't held the Martial Arts Competition,

256
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,940
♫How to forget it?♫

257
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,840
would none of this have happened?

258
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:45,110
♫One more look before you go♫

259
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,710
Miss.

260
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,550
Uncle San.

261
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,390
Yu Zhao has left, right?

262
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,070
Did you give it to him?

263
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,690
Miss.

264
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,470
I don't understand.

265
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,800
Why don't you

266
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,990
send him off yourself?

267
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,060
We'll meet again.

268
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,470
Xixi.

269
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,430
I have to save them now.

270
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,550
Yun,

271
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,270
it's not the time to act recklessly.

272
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,550
We must save them.

273
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,050
But we need a surefire plan.

274
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,350
Plan? How long do we still need?

275
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,590
We'll lose them if we continue to ponder a plan.

276
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,070
Calm down.

277
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,110
How can I calm down?

278
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,880
How can I calm down now?

279
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,790
Huo was taken away.

280
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,870
I must save him.

281
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,060
You're not going to save them, right?

282
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,750
Fine.

283
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,910
If you don't save them, I'll save them myself.

284
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,270
Yu Xixi.

285
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,440
Let's not contact each other anymore.

286
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,910
We're not friends anymore.

287
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,400
Well...

288
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,830
We must figure out a surefire plan.

289
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,850
Otherwise, we will not only be unable to save Yu Zhao

290
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,750
but also put everyone in danger.

291
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,250
Yu Zhao.

292
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,380
Wait for me.

293
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,950
Jin Gang!

294
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,880
Miss,

295
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,710
don't take it to heart.

296
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,830
Jin Gang

297
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,010
has been in a bad mood lately.

298
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,320
It’s okay. I know.

299
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,060
By the way, where is Yun?

300
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,470
Miss Li Yun is missing.

301
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,410
Did she really go to find Huo?

302
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,070
There's been no news of Miss Li Yun

303
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,390
since she went missing.

304
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,670
Manager Li is so worried

305
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
and has been searching for her everywhere.

306
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,080
Do you think

307
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,870
something bad has happened to her?

308
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,640
Let's go to the Huixian Restaurant.

309
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,030
Uncle San went there this morning.

310
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,800
Miss.

311
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,390
Yu Xixi.

312
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,150
It's all because of you.

313
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,339
If it weren't for you,

314
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,349
Zihe wouldn't have...

315
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,880
But I didn't expect

316
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,090
that you could still live here in ease,

317
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,710
when he has been taken away for so many days.

318
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,110
He is...

319
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,480
What?

320
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,850
Do you know why I left?

321
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,190
Why?

322
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,550
Because he likes you.

323
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,210
I know that.

324
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,230
You know that?

325
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,190
Then why are you still acting like this?

326
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,550
Since I was young,

327
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,260
he's the only person I've loved.

328
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,310
Even though he has disappeared for so many years,

329
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,210
I've never stopped loving him.

330
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,670
But when I met him again,

331
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,270
I found that everything had changed.

332
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,110
He can only see you.

333
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,110
No matter what I do,

334
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,150
nothing can change that.

335
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,630
So I left and gave up.

336
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,430
But I didn't expect

337
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,510
that you wouldn't cherish him at all.

338
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,270
Miss Liu,

339
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,590
you misunderstood me.

340
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,470
It's not that I don't want to save Yu Zhao.

341
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,930
He is very important to me.

342
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,920
Then all these days...

343
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,750
I've been thinking.

344
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,910
Thinking of a comprehensive plan.

345
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,770
Have you figured out anything?

346
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,240
Not yet.

347
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,120
But I'm glad you came.

348
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,720
I need your help.

349
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,360
You need me?

350
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,540
Your father is the Mirror Commander of the Mirror Department.

351
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,530
He should know a lot about Ye Yunqing

352
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,780
and Lu Ming Manor.

353
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,320
Well...

354
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,270
I know a little.

355
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,150
Okay.

356
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,150
I need you to tell me

357
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,310
all that you know.

358
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,470
It seems

359
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,900
that you don't like the food.

360
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,030
Have some, no matter what.

361
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,830
I can't bear the consequences

362
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,230
if you get sick.

363
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,590
Looks like you're not going to cooperate.

364
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,830
Looks like

365
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,910
I'll have to send someone to your home

366
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,830
to invite Miss Yu Xixi

367
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,600
to feed you.

368
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,280
You promised me that you would leave her alone.

369
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,870
The tables have turned.

370
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,470
Back then, in your place,

371
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,490
I agreed

372
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,690
to avoid any trouble.

373
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:25,990
But now,

374
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,280
you're in the prison of my manor.

375
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,510
As long as Yu Xixi is alive,

376
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,350
you have to do

377
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,170
whatever I say.

378
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,250
Are you still human?

379
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,860
I'm one in the martial arts world.

380
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,830
You are a businessman.

381
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,350
Businessmen value honor.

382
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,590
And we people

383
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,800
value power.

384
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,140
When someone

385
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,670
falls in love,

386
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,430
they will have a weakness.

387
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,760
So does my son.

388
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,410
My dear nephew,

389
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,270
so do you.

390
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,190
Leave her alone.

391
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,150
To be honest,

392
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,510
you're completely at my mercy.

393
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,910
Do you know why you went crazy

394
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,980
during the Martial Arts Competition?

395
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,390
What is this?

396
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,230
It was specially made for you.

397
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,070
This bottle

398
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,870
can make you go crazy.

399
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
And this bottle

400
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,270
can clear your mind.

401
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,770
What?

402
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,550
You want it?

403
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,350
Fine.

404
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,110
I'll give it to you if you want it.

405
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,310
I have plenty of them.

406
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,190
And

407
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,960
as long as I have the drug

408
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,440
that can clear your mind,

409
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,100
you can't escape me.
