[Yu Mansion]

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,430
No.

6
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,030
We can't hold the Martial Arts Competition at Huixian Restaurant.

7
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,590
That is to leave ourselves open to attack.

8
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,910
So I want you two

9
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,039
to take care of Huixian Restaurant.

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,850
I wonder why

11
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,200
you think that we have

12
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,720
the ability to take care of the restaurant?

13
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,630
Huo

14
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,540
is highly skilled in martial arts.

15
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,310
And he calls you master.

16
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,060
That means you are good martial artists.

17
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,300
Besides,

18
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,090
you don't look like scholars.

19
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,780
That's right.

20
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,490
You can tell

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,680
from how we look like

22
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,230
that we are indeed martial artists.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,530
Eldest Young Master, you are right.

24
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,960
Eldest Young Master?

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,950
To be honest,

26
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,829
we were

27
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,460
the left and right guardians of the Knife Master, Feng Lie.

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,350
We have been hiding our identities

29
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,829
to find the whereabouts of the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

30
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,050
The Knife Master, Feng Lie.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
So the boy named Huo?

32
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,450
He is Feng Zihuan,

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,190
the second son of the Knife Master.

34
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,030
And you

35
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,350
are the eldest son of the Knife Master.

36
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,460
Feng Zihe.

37
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,490
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

38
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,670
I'm not Feng Zihe.

39
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,079
Show me your hand.

40
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,710
This scar was left when you practiced knife skills in childhood.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,710
This scar

42
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,890
was left when I fell down.

43
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,350
You are not sensible.

44
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,290
It's your turn.

45
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,730
Manager Yu.

46
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,770
We've finished

47
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,470
what we should say.

48
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,910
I just want to tell you

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,070
the Martial Arts Competition, if there is one,

50
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,170
will put Feng Zihe

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,330
in dire danger.

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,510
Of course.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,420
If you're not Feng Zihe,

54
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,650
you don't need to worry.

55
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,240
But if you are,

56
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,470
I hope

57
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,830
you may think twice.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,070
However,

59
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:23,950
no matter what,

60
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,320
since you've said it,

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,660
on the day of the Martial Arts Competition,

62
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,210
the two of us

63
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,030
will do our best to protect you.

64
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,640
Thank you.

65
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,830
Please accept it.

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,630
Okay.

67
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,080
Well.

68
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,030
I'll do as you say.

69
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,790
By the way,

70
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,520
on the day of the Martial Arts Competition,

71
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,010
it's better for you

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
not to show up.

73
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,270
Goodbye.

74
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,790
Young Master.

75
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,530
Why did you call them here?

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,800
What's the matter?

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,590
Know-it-all has found out

78
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,510
what you wanted her to find.

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
Where she is now?

80
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,540
She's still in the same place.

81
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:27,910
Let's go.

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,790
Manager Yu.

83
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,940
I didn't expect it

84
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,320
to be so important.

85
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,440
My risk has also increased.

86
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,800
So...

87
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,920
Please tell me what you know.

88
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,980
The woman on the portrait is Bai Linglong.

89
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,470
She's the wife of Cheng Wen from Yixiao Hall.

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,180
How could Mother...

91
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,430
Are you sure?

92
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,590
Of course.

93
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
My spies are all over the world.

94
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,390
It's true.

95
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,430
Please go on.

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,550
Do you know Feixing City?

97
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,190
It's about 500 kilometers away from Xianyun City.

98
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,860
It's a prosperous city.

99
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,150
I wanted to open a branch

100
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,790
of Huixian Restaurant there many times before.

101
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,510
But Mother didn't allow it.

102
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,750
Bai Linglong's father

103
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,710
was also a rich businessman in Feixing City.

104
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,300
But later, his business failed and his family was ruined.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,470
After that, Bai Linglong was homeless.

106
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,680
Her father had an apprentice.

107
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,290
That was Hai Liyuan, Master of Yixiao Hall.

108
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,870
He knew his master's daughter was homeless.

109
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,390
So he went to great lengths to find Bai Linglong

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
and took her back.

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,150
Hai Liyuan was busy,

112
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,550
so he asked Bai Linglong

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,290
to stay with his wife.

114
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,990
Bai Linglong was so capable of dealing with social relations

115
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,390
that Mrs. Hai liked her very much.

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,430
Mrs. Hai and Bai Linglong became sworn sisters,

117
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,110
and naturally, Linglong followed Mrs. Hai's surname which is Bai.

118
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,390
From then on, they became sisters.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
Mrs. Hai came from a family known for death-point striking.

120
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,030
So she taught Bai Linglong.

121
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,510
Bai Linglong was really gifted.

122
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,830
In a short time,

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,710
she mastered all skills for death-point striking.

124
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,100
Besides,

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,490
Bai Linglong was talented in business,

126
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,409
which won her the admiration from Mr. Hai.

127
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,710
Soon,

128
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,240
under the support of Mr. Hai and Mrs. Hai

129
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,950
Bai Linglong married Cheng Wen,

130
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,260
Mr. Hai's sworn brother and Vice Master of Yixiao Hall.

131
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,780
The first bow, to the heaven and earth.

132
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,510
The second bow, to your parents.

133
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,530
The last bow, to each other.

134
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,110
From then on, Bai Linglong

135
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,030
became Mr. Hai's capable assistant.

136
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
And then?

137
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,590
Nothing special

138
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,910
until that night 13 years ago,

139
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,660
when Hai Liyuan and his wife were killed.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Yixiao Hall was also wiped out.

141
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,190
Whether Bai Linglong is alive remains unknown.

142
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,030
I don't know what happened later.

143
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,880
Have you found any clue

144
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,120
to Hai Liyuan's Red Jade of Cangqiong?

145
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
His Red Jade of Cangqiong

146
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,830
has disappeared for a long time.

147
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,230
What is the carved on that jade?

148
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,230
A dragon.

149
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,539
A flood dragon.

150
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,740
Thank you so much.

151
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,120
Please don't tell anyone about what happened today.

152
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,070
Manager Yu,

153
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,660
is something going to happen?

154
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,110
Is it related to the Demon Boy?

155
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,830
The Martial Arts Competition.

156
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,090
I can complete the bet after the Martial Arts Competition.

157
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,950
My engagement with Yu Zhao can also be canceled.

158
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,620
I can also know

159
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,440
who my biological parents are.

160
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,530
It's strange. Why am I a little disappointed?

161
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,140
What will happen to Yu Zhao if I win?

162
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,230
Yu Xixi. Yu Xixi. What are you thinking about?

163
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,910
I wanted to leave Yu Zhao as soon as possible.

164
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,700
Why am I in a dilemma now?

165
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,570
So annoying. Why am I thinking of Yu Zhao again?

166
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,320
The woman on the portrait is Bai Linglong.

167
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,780
She's the wife of Cheng Wen from Yixiao Hall.

168
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,470
Until that night 13 years ago,

169
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,250
when Hai Liyuan and his wife were killed.

170
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,950
Yixiao Hall was also wiped out.

171
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,030
Whether Bai Linglong is alive remains unknown.

172
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,790
Yu Xixi.

173
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,660
What are you doing here?

174
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,820
Nothing.

175
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,830
I'm just passing by. It's fine.

176
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,610
Are you looking for me?

177
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,510
No.

178
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,700
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

179
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,330
Sit down.

180
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:33,670
Okay.

181
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,790
A sleepless night?

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,530
Tomorrow will be the Martial Arts Competition.

183
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,830
I'm a little nervous.

184
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,960
Don't be nervous.

185
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,860
Everything will go smoothly.

186
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,220
After the Martial Arts Competition,

187
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,990
you'll win the bet.

188
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,610
Congratulations.

189
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,470
For what?

190
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,100
What about you?

191
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,390
Me?

192
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,960
The bet.

193
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,630
If I win,

194
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,190
you will lose.

195
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,830
I'll admit defeat.

196
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
Since you win,

197
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,990
I respect all your decisions.

198
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,200
Everything

199
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,550
is up to you.

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,820
♫Fireworks lighting up in the sky♫

201
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,790
I've figured it out.

202
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,820
No one can control your life,

203
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,590
even if it's Mother.

204
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,460
♫Whose love is it?♫

205
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,390
That's not what I mean.

206
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,610
♫A flashing epiphyllum♫

207
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,470
What do you mean?

208
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,230
♫Ask, don't wait until the flowers fall♫

209
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,770
That's not what I mean, either.

210
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,570
♫But who knows the answer?♫

211
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,490
♫Just fall♫

212
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,150
You look handsome when you smile.

213
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,970
You should smile more.

214
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,290
♫How can I get closer?♫

215
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,020
No. Forget it.

216
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,880
♫How can I smile?♫

217
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,490
♫Where you look back in the lights♫

218
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,390
Do you remember that place?

219
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,600
♫Flowers bloom♫

220
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,570
♫How can I remember it?♫

221
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,710
Of course.

222
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,620
On the 15th of each month,

223
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,170
♫How can I forget it?♫

224
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,390
we would all sit there to admire the moon.

225
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,450
♫I'm afraid I can never see you again♫

226
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,750
Yes.

227
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,600
Since Mother passed away,

228
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,350
we haven't been there for a long time.

229
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,310
Do you want to go?

230
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,550
Let's go.

231
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,210
Let's go.

232
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,110
The moon tonight

233
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,440
♫Fireworks dancing in the sky♫

234
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,150
is not full at all.

235
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,810
The moon waxes and wanes.

236
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,510
♫Whose dream is it?♫

237
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,110
People have good days and bad days.

238
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,110
It's hard to have a happy ending.

239
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,310
♫There is a mist in my dreams♫

240
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,800
You taught me this when I was a kid.

♫Wake up, don't wait for everyone to leave♫

242
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,070
When you were young,

243
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,270
it took you a month

244
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,280
to memorise these simple lines.

245
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,820
♫I'll be alone with grey hair♫

246
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,250

Xixi.

♫Where you look back in the lights♫

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,770

Just asking.

♫I'm afraid I can never see you again♫

259
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,720

♫One more look and I'll never see you♫

264
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,970
Enough. Enough.

265
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
Our bad-looking faces already made us stand out.

266
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,920
Don't shake your head.

267
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,860
They may recognize us.

268
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,350
It has been years.

269
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,990
We've changed our faces for more than 30 times.

270
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,010
Who would remember what we looked like?

271
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,870
Cut the crap.

272
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,470
I think

273
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,350
you are too nervous.

274
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,230
In my opinion,

275
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,720
this is

276
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,380
an ordinary competition.

277
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,740
Just because

278
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,190
it's been years since we last held it.

279
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,710
All sects

280
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,140
are here to befriend,

281
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,590
eat and drink,

282
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,560
saying nice words to each other.

283
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,830
Stop talking.

284
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,270
Ye Yunqing hasn't shown up yet.

285
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,010
Don't let your guard down.

286
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,630
Who do you think they are?

287
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,930
Why are they sneaking around?

288
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,870
They seem to be Huo's masters.

289
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,760
Why are they so mysterious?

290
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,030
All of them are abnormal.

291
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
By the way, where is Yu Zhao?

292
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,910
I haven't seen Young Master for a whole day.

293
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,790
Miss.

294
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,030
Young Master trusts you a lot this time.

295
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,830
He didn't care about the Martial Arts Competition at all.

296
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,060
Miss Li.

297
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,400
I'm your admirer.

298
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
You've worked so hard.

299
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,580
Have some water.

300
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,990
I'm thirsty. I'll drink.

301
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,710
I'm done. Please leave.

302
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,830
I'm thirsty too.

303
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,420
You're not.

304
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,310
Master Ye is here.

305
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,360
Master Ye, please come in.

306
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,830
Wait.

307
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,310
Why is the guard around Ye Chenxing

308
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,920
missing?

309
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,710
Yes.

310
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,430
Doesn't the guard follow him all the time?

311
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:13,990
That's strange.

312
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,290
Go to Yu Mansion and find Eldest Young Master.

313
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,339
Take him away.

314
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,160
Yes!

315
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,410
This...

316
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,030
The Sword Master is here! Move aside!

317
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,480
The Sword Master?

318
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,630
Ye Yunqing.

319
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,590
It's your privilege to see me here.

320
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,230
You really think you're the Sword Master?

321
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,420
How dare you!

322
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,760
Harmony brings wealth.

323
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,590
Harmony brings wealth.

324
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,390
Today is a great reunion.

325
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,810
There's no hierarchy.

326
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,480
Besides,

327
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,190
Master Ye

328
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,370
is mainly responsible for the Martial Arts Competition.

329
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,670
Master Ye paid for it.

330
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,930
Please understand.

331
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,670
Wealth means everything.

332
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,350
OK.

333
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,910
Let's give a seat

334
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,790
for the Sword Master.

335
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,190
Master Ye, please.

336
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,630
Please be quiet.

337
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,190
Today, the Lu Ming Manor

338
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,540
gathers all of you in the name of the Sword Master

339
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,090
for only one reason.

340
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,520
That is to revive the whole martial arts world.

341
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,930
After the Knife Master and the Laugh Master died,

342
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,710
there was no chief.

343
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,550
In recent years,

344
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,190
all sects have fought separately

345
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,110
and even attacked each other.

346
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,170
Master Ye was very sad.

347
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,260
The Lu Ming Manor

348
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,420
can't stand by anymore.

349
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,470
We must take the responsibility of the Sword Master.

350
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,150
So today, in front of everyone,

351
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,990
we should select a new Chief of Sects

352
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,820
to lead the whole martial arts world

353
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,070
and revive martial arts.

354
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,670
I suggest

355
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,990
Master Ye

356
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,430
be the Chief of Sects.

357
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,010
Master Ye is the most suitable,

358
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,310
judging from his social status

359
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,910
and reputation.

360
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,900
Why? Why?

361
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,040
Why him?

362
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,670
Why?

363
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,900
Because you've been a coward

364
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,740
for over ten years?

365
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,960
Aye.

366
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,150
We've done what by humanity and duty

367
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,590
by coming here today.

368
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,120
Do you really think you're still the Sword Master a decade ago?

369
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,400
Aye.

370
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,960
If you have any objections,

371
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,950
we can discuss them.

372
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,490
After all, this is about the whole martial arts world.

373
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,040
We're doing this for the sake of martial arts.

374
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,910
It'll never be Ye Yunqing's turn to be the Chief.

375
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,320
In my opinion,

376
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,870
Master Yun is more suitable.

377
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,720
Am I right?

378
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,660
Yes, that's right. That's right.

379
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
It's your right

380
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,430
to select a Chief.

381
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,950
I support you.

382
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,550
But

383
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,900
how about the Demon Boy, Feng Zihe?

384
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,080
What do you mean?

385
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,250
Wasn't he burned to death

386
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,600
thirteen years ago?

387
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,850
What if he is still alive?

388
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,790
Thirteen years ago,

389
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,160
someone saved Feng Zihe.

390
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,180
That body

391
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,190
was not his.

392
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,930
The Demon Boy is still alive?

393
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,570
What do you mean?

394
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,160
As we all know,

395
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,910
the Sword Master passed the red jade

396
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,670
to his eldest son, Feng Zihe.

397
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,600
After the Knife Master and the Laugh Master died,

398
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,720
their red jade disappeared.

399
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,630
Besides,

400
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,910
the so-called Feng Zihe's body

401
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,790
was completely ruined.

402
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,030
No one could identify it.

403
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,830
This was too strange.

404
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
I always think

405
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,680
the Demon Boy is still alive.

406
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
The Red Jade of Cangqiong of the Sword Master

407
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,160
is still with the Demon Boy.

408
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,240
This... This...

409
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,900
How is that possible?

410
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,300
For all these years,

411
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,450
the Lu Ming Manor

412
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,360
has been investigating

413
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,380
and looking for the missing red jade.

414
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
I didn't expect

415
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,270
we really found the Demon Boy, Feng Zihe.

416
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,990
Why should we trust you?

417
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,920
Who knows whether you found a fake one

418
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,610
to fool us?

419
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,480
Aye.

420
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:00,970
Aye.
