[Bazaar Beloved Birds]

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,200
[Episode 1]

4
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,460
This person is Yu Zhao,

5
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,880
the only son of the Yu family.

6
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,600
He is also the manager of Huixian Restaurant.

7
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,380
and has gained great prominence in Xianyun City.

8
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,949
Objectively speaking, he can be considered talented and good-looking.

9
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,070
Moreover, he often puts on airs and graces.

10
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,830
Many young ladies in the city

11
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,790
wish to marry him.

12
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:18,310
If they could really marry him, it would be great.

13
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,270
He wouldn't have to pester me then.

14
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,230
I'm not bragging.

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,730
Being pursued by him is not a good thing.

16
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,110
Besides, that day is getting closer.

17
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,790
What should I do?

18
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,400
What's wrong with you?

19
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,190
Today it's your turn to treat, and you're sighing.

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,790
Are you reluctant to spend money?

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,079
Let's go over there and drink.

22
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's go.

23
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,400
Come on, Miss.

24
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,140
Let's raise our glasses together,

25
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,180
to Miss Xixi.

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,560
Thanks for treating us.

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,540
Xixi.

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,210
How has

29
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,560
your manager Yu been lately?

30
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,180
Is it time for him to get married?

31
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,540
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,590
Manager Yu? Getting married?

33
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,430
Why are you asking about this?

34
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,270
Tell me the truth.

35
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,940
What's going on? Something is wrong.

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,200
Nothing.

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,180
I'm not feeling well.

38
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,130
-Miss.
-Xixi.

39
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,520
Miss, don't go.

40
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,000
It's Manager Yu!

41
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,510
Speak of the devil.

42
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,760
Young... Young Master.

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,490
Marvelous! Manager Yu!

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,850
No, I have to go.

45
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,200
No.

46
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,870
-You can’t leave.
-Let me go!

47
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,800
Let me go!

48
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,370
Manager.

49
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,390
Uncle San.

50
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,090
Where is Xixi?

51
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,230
She is in the pavilion upstairs.

52
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,100
Let me go!

53
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,250
No!

54
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,500
Li Yun, let go of me!

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,830
He’s coming up. Let me go!

56
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,400
Let me go!

57
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,030
Go!

58
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,510
Miss...

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,300
Come on, let's drink.

60
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,910
Drink up. Pretend nothing happened.

61
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,870
Hurry up.

62
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,650
Young Master, please have a seat.

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,550
You're here. Join us and eat together.

64
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,210
Did you forget something?

65
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,980
What did I forget?

66
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,260
Tomorrow is the wedding.

67
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Wedding?

68
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,500
-Wedding? -Wedding?

69
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,160
What's going on? Are't they siblings?

70
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,640
Yes. What's going on?

71
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,350
Ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,720
everyone here is a good friend of Xixi.

73
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,330
I have an announcement to make.

74
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,190
Before my mother passed away, she arranged for Xixi to be engaged to me.

75
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,490
Tomorrow,

76
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,780
I hope you all can join us for our wedding ceremony.

77
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,720
What?

78
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,390
Yu Zhao, what are you doing?

79
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,750
I've already helped you throw away your garbage.

80
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,480
That's my hobby.

81
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,090
Just find a new hobby.

82
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,170
Are you crazy?

83
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,470
Beyond cure.

84
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,160
You...

85
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,100
Yu Zhao.

86
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,420
Stop!

87
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,700
By the way.

88
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,890
This is for you.

89
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,500
I...

90
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,790
Isn't this the jade pendant that Young Master has always treasured?

91
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,190
How did you know?

92
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,390
Last time when Xiang was cleaning Young Master's room,

93
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,230
she happened to see it.

94
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,150
Young Master was holding the jade pendant, lost in thought.

95
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,500
As soon as he saw me coming in,

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,430
he immediately hid it.

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,130
So Xiang remembers it very clearly.

98
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,780
Miss.

99
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,200
Young Master is really good to you.

100
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,500
I...

101
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,200
Give it to me.

102
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,990
Miss.

103
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,110
This jade pendant looks quite expensive.

104
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,310
Why waste money?

105
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm asking you a serious question.

106
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,690
Aren't you and that Yu Zhao siblings?

107
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,350
How can you get married?

108
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,950
Let's talk over there.

109
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,080
Let's go.

110
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,510
What's going on? Tell me.

111
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,590
Miss.

112
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
This...

113
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,780
is a long story.

114
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,700
[Yu Mansion]

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,700
[A decade or so ago]

116
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,690
In childhood, he came riding a bamboo horse,

117
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,640
playing with green plums around the bed.

118
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,960
I've known Yu Zhao since we were little.

119
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,270
You could say we were childhood sweethearts.

120
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,820
Back then, my mother didn't allow me to leave the mansion much.

121
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,990
But luckily, I could climb the mansion walls

122
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,820
to take a peek outside.

123
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,630
Everything outside deeply attracted me.

124
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,419
However, every time I tried,

125
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,840
Yu Zhao would always find a way to block me.

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,620
What are you doing?

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Go back to study.

128
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,480
You're so annoying!

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
My mother also didn't like me

130
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,950
tinkering with mechanical balls and such.

131
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,390
Whenever I picked up a mechanical ball,

132
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,270
Yu Zhao would bring mother to interrupt me.

133
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,600
Afterward,

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,030
there would be a sycophantic smile on his face.

135
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,830
Fortunately,

136
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,110
not long after, he was sent by mother to various branches

137
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,070
for inspection and training.

138
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,110
Young Master.

139
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,590
The day he left,

140
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,940
I thought I would be happy.

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,410
But in reality,

142
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,790
there was a strange feeling in my heart,

143
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,550
definitely not joy.

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,170
But finally, I had peace.

145
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,370
Then, 8 years later,

146
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,450
during the general meeting of all branches of Huixian Restaurant,

147
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,990
Yu Zhao returned to Yu Mansion.

148
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
At that time, I didn't know

149
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,990
this person was my nightmare, Yu Zhao.

150
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,910
I was even captivated by him.

151
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,600
I must have been blind.

152
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,920
And so, 2 more years passed.

153
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,700
My mother fell ill with a strange disease

154
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,220
and was going to pass on soon.

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,650
It was at that time

156
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,580
that he appeared in front of me again.

157
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,350
My heart raced when I saw him.

158
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,630
But mother quickly dealt me a heavy blow.

159
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,730
Xixi, look at him.

160
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,070
He is Yu Zhao.

161
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,100
When I heard that the person

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
I had been infatuated with for two years was Yu Zhao,

163
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,670
I was devastated.

164
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,660
What?

165
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,230
That's impossible!

166
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,630
Mother, mother! Mother!

167
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,430
Mother.

168
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,720
Xixi.

169
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,280
You're not my biological child.

170
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,720
I found you and adopted you.

171
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,390
What happened?

172
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,350
It's not...

173
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:25,990
Mother!

174
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,830
Mother!

175
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,790
I'm dying.

176
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,790
After I die,

177
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,830
you two

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,960
should get married.

179
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,780
Mother!

180
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,910
What exactly happened?

181
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,150
Stop.

182
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,970
There is too much information.

183
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,050
So you're not your mother's daughter.

184
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,110
You're your mother's...

185
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,390
daughter-in-law?

186
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,310
That's not wrong.

187
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,650
Didn't Her Ladyship pass away 3 years ago?

188
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
Why now...

189
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
Yu Zhao said

190
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,920
he has to mourn for her mother for 3 years.

191
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,810
In fact, it's just another way to torment me for 3 more years.

192
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
You have no idea how I've endured these past 3 years.

193
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,890
Today is the first day after the mourning period ended.

194
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,680
It's so annoying.

195
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,470
This Yu Zhao,

196
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,330
he actually dared to throw away my things.

197
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,000
He seemed strange today.

198
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,230
He even gave me a jade pendant.

199
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,870
Something must have gone wrong.

200
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,710
There must be a trap.

201
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,650
There isn't.

202
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,350
Who is it?

203
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,890
Miss, it's me.

204
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,110
What happened?

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,960
Young Master asked me to check on you.

206
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,030
He told you to go to bed early.

207
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,150
-Then the wedding will…
-Got it. He's so annoying.

208
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,170
This ball, I don't know why,

209
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,260
has been with me since I was little.

210
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,800
But I've never opened it.

211
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,360
[Xiao]

212
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,390
[Yu Mansion]

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,520
Thank you.

214
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,910
Thank you.

215
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:00,990
Thank you.

216
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,990
Young Master.

217
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Young Master!

218
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,700
Young Master!

219
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,760
Young Master!

220
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,060
How is it?

221
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,560
Is Xixi ready?

222
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,150
The auspicious moment is approaching.

223
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,400
Young Master,

224
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,250
I've called Miss several times.

225
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,640
But she's been standing still in the room.

226
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,950
I haven't dared to call her again.

227
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,030
-After all, Miss…
-No.

228
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm not a puppet

229
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,040
to be manipulated at will.

230
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,680
There's no need to look for me.

231
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,750
Anyway, you won't find me.

232
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,240
But don't worry.

233
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,550
Once the auspicious moment passes, I will come back.

234
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,390
Wonderful! The feeling of freedom is amazing.

235
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,590
From now on, the sky is high and the birds can fly,

236
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,630
the sea is vast and the fish can leap.

237
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,380
But where should I begin with all of this?

238
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,790
Good.

239
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,910
Why do I feel

240
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,880
it looks so much like Yu Zhao?

241
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,160
Everything was ready.

242
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,570
The next step was disguise.

243
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,810
The uniform of the Yu Mansion's servants

244
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,210
was the best disguise.

245
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,410
Perfect.

246
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,610
Then, the most crucial step:

247
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,430
escape.

248
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,170
The backyard was the most challenging step

249
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,720
because Jin Gang would be there.

250
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,800
Jin Gang is Yu Zhao's loyal dog,

251
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,820
and he's cautious.

252
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,320
Whether I could get past him

253
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,360
might require some luck.

254
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,810
Brother Jin Gang, where should I put this batch of goods?

255
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,470
Inside, that room.

256
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,950
Obviously,

257
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,190
I was very lucky.

258
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,590
Then, I just needed to improvise freely.

259
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,700
Thank you, sir.

260
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,630
Thank you.

261
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,950
The feeling of freedom is really nice.

262
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,940
As for this marriage, whoever wants to get married, go ahead.

263
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,870
Seriously.

264
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,190
Seriously.

265
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,010
Uncle San.

266
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,300
What happened?

267
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,010
Miss ran away from the wedding.

268
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,750
What should we do?

269
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,230
The guests have all arrived.

270
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,630
And the auspicious moment is approaching.

271
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,140
If the wedding cannot take place,

272
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,540
our Yu Mansion

273
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
will become the biggest joke in the world.

274
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,090
We still have time.

275
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,000
No big deal.

276
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,550
Young Master will soon bring Yu Xixi back.

277
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,480
Who gave you such confidence?

278
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,180
The key lies

279
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,450
in the jade pendant Young Master gave to Yu Xixi.

280
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,110
The jade pendant?

281
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,750
Yes.

282
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,240
For that jade pendant,

283
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,540
Young Master used four kinds of spices:

284
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,850
chicken tongue incense, tangerine peel, mugwort,

285
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,880
and Suhe incense to smoke it for 49 days.

286
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,310
The scents of these spices

287
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,200
have deeply permeated the jade pendant.

288
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,090
That Wealth that Young Master trained

289
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,840
is very familiar with this scent.

290
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,070
So, as long as Yu Xixi is wearing that jade pendant,

291
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,240
Wealth can follow the scent.

292
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,690
and find her.

293
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,610
Young Master is indeed Young Master.

294
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,420
Of course.

295
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,210
Young Master even gave a special name to this jade pendant.

296
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,640
What is the name?

297
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,060
It's called GPS.

298
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,000
-Impressive!
-Let's wait and see.

299
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,250
Young Master, come back with me.

300
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,190
If Master finds out,

301
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,200
you'll inevitably face punishment.

302
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,550
I'll just play for a few days.

303
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,869
I'll go back before he comes out of seclusion.

304
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,900
Don't worry. No one will know.

305
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,960
It's so hot wearing this.

306
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,380
You mustn't.

307
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,890
The martial world is treacherous.

308
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,210
After all, you are the son of the Sword Master.

309
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,150
If there's any danger...

310
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,440
Who in the martial world still recognizes the Sword Master?

311
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,270
Mo,

312
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,670
isn't it hot wearing this?

313
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,550
Take it off.

314
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,290
It's better to be careful.

315
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,390
Okay.

316
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,350
Mo, give me some money.

317
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,260
What do you want it for?

318
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,050
For ordering things.

319
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Don't be fooled by the quietness here.

320
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,470
The sliced lamb here

321
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,690
is famously delicious.

322
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,600
We should definitely give it a try.

323
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,230
I...

324
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,750
have no money.

325
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,060
Mo, you're good at everything

326
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,300
except for lying.

327
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,190
Young Master,

328
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,600
you already owe me a substantial 50 taels of silver.

329
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,510
So stingy.

330
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,920
My dad only gives me a little allowance every month, and it's never enough.

331
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,540
Besides, Lu Ming Manor isn't doing well now,

332
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,480
and I can't keep spending the manor's money.

333
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,150
So, you're using my money?

334
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,310
Of course.

335
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,620
You worked so hard to earn the money.

336
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,620
How can I live up to your expectations if I don't spend it?

337
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,310
Okay.

338
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,910
Don’t worry.

339
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,750
I'll pay you back once I become the Master.

340
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
Boss lady, serve the dishes.

341
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,510
Who are you?

342
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,550
We're going to be rich this time.

343
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,670
Look at how this girl is dressed,

344
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,910
she's obviously a young lady from a wealthy family.

345
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,750
Let go of me!

346
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,750
Don't think about letting her go without 500 taels. Retreat!

347
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,550
What's going on?

348
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,230
How dare you commit a crime in front of me?

349
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,020
Mind your own business!

350
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:31,830
Young Master!

351
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
Let go of that girl!

352
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,160
Let go of me!

353
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,260
What is that?

354
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,670
Did he go the wrong way?

355
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,640
He scared me.

356
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,190
Let go of me!

357
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,550
Young Master, pull the reins!

358
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,240
What's going on?

359
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,880
If I say I don't know,

360
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,780
would you believe me?

361
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,470
You don't know?

362
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,000
Should you be here now?

363
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,910
Where should I be?

364
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,950
Where do you think you should be?

365
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,670
I don't know.

366
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:31,990
Excuse me.

367
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,430
Get us a doctor.

368
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,630
-Young Master.
-Miss.

369
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,900
Arrange for Yu Xixi

370
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,260
to freshen up and change clothes, and prepare for the wedding.

371
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,210
Also, have someone keep a close eye on her

372
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,370
to prevent any further mistakes.

373
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,540
Yes, Young Master.

374
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,140
Miss.

375
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,430
Miss.

376
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,470
It's the auspicious moment.

377
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
The wedding ceremony begins.

378
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,580
Welcome the bride.

379
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,360
♫Your hair wraps around my finger♫

380
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,880
♫I'm lost in my dream and I don't know anything♫

381
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,440
♫After having a drink, you left♫

382
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,960
♫I wanted you to stay♫

383
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:48,190
♫Silly, sentimental lover in this mortal realm♫

384
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,390
First, bow to heaven and earth.

385
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:55,830
♫Drizzling raindrops in the coolness of an autumn night♫

386
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,510
Second, bow to parents.

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:05,380
♫Mountains have trees, and trees have branches♫

389
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,800
Bride and groom exchange bows.

390
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:13,400
♫I love you, but you are unaware♫

391
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,390
The ritual is accomplished!

392
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:19,110
♫How many partings and reunions on the divine mountain♫

393
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:27,210
♫Though reluctant to part, what matters most is not being together every day♫

394
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,110
How about we unveil the cover now?

395
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,310
Wait.

396
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,790
I haven't decided yet.

397
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,790
At this point, what are you thinking about?

398
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,540
Now is the time to think even more.

399
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,580
I won't marry you.

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,950
What?

401
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,860
I've had enough of you.

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,880
Everything has to be done according to your will.

403
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,200
After Mother's death,

404
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,570
it has become more critical.

405
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,860
What else can I do?

406
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,750
Letting you have your way?

407
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,720
What's wrong with letting me have my way?

408
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,520
I am a living person,

409
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,880
and of course, I have my own thoughts.

410
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,670
Moreover, I don't even know

411
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,750
who my biological parents are.

412
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,370
In the Yu Mansion, I am just a dependent.

413
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,230
Now I have to marry you in this way.

414
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,620
Have you considered my feelings?

415
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,050
Your feelings?

416
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,460
Then tell me.

417
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,880
I want to study mechanical arts.

418
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,910
I feel that it's related to my identity.

419
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,070
It's all your imagination.

420
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,190
Besides, as a young lady,

421
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,670
you expose yourself too much, and if word gets out...

422
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,710
Must a young lady always be gentle and agreeable?

423
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,390
Besides, I don't want to marry someone

424
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,180
I don't love.

425
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Parental arrangements are someone else's rules,

426
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,630
not mine.

427
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,920
Wait.

428
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,430
What?

429
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,540
Before Mother passed away, she wanted me to marry you

430
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,170
because she was concerned about your future

431
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,630
and wanted me to take care of you.

432
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,320
You have to prove to me

433
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,130
that you can take care of yourself.

434
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,670
So that

435
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,110
I can fulfill my promise to Mother.

436
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,500
How do you want me to prove it?

437
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,450
It's up to you. I'll follow your lead.

438
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,180
How about this?

439
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,510
In 3 months,

440
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,150
if I can earn enough money,

441
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,450
the engagement will be completely canceled.

442
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,290
And if you don't earn enough?

443
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,070
Then we get married, and I'll be devoted to you.

444
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,720
Earning money is too easy.

445
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,650
Even a single copper coin counts as earnings.

446
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,690
Let's set a target.

447
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,520
How much do you want to set?

448
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,990
Your monthly expenses,

449
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,430
including all the miscellaneous things,

450
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,860
are at least 50 taels.

451
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,620
So, for 3 months, it's at least 150 taels.

452
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,590
I'll cut you some slack

453
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,560
and make it 100 taels for 3 months.

454
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,950
100 taels.

455
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,140
100 taels?

456
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,600
How about 80 taels?

457
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,490
150 taels.

458
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,190
100 taels. Deal.

459
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,900
It's a deal.
