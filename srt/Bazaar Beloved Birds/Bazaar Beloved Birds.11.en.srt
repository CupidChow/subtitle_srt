Sir, please come inside.

Please come inside.

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,430
Sir, please come inside.

Goodbye.

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,430
Fill it up.

10
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,950
Young Master,

11
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,440
this is Mr. Wan, whom I mentioned to you,

12
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,390
known as the Know-it-all in the martial world,

13
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,390
always traveling with a carefree spirit.

14
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,079
These days, she happened to arrive in Xianyun City,

15
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,240
so I quickly made an appointment with Mr. Wan.

16
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
Mr. Wan is a girl?

17
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,790
I just found out too.

18
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,230
Is she reliable?

19
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,100
Don't worry.

20
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,340
It seems that Manager Yu

21
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,250
doesn't trust me very much.

22
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,770
It's not that.

23
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,590
I just didn't expect

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,320
that Mr. Wan is...

25
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Everyone in the martial world calls me Mr. Wan.

26
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,410
But they don't know that Mr. Wan is a woman.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't you find that interesting?

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,150
Indeed.

29
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,030
Do you know why I invited you here?

30
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,920
I don't know.

31
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,150
Of course, it's because Manager Yu is handsome and charming.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,250
I believe Manager Yu...

33
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:20,800
Mr. Wan,

34
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,750
please behave with dignity.

35
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,579
I'm just kidding.

36
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,750
Look at you.

37
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,310
The reason I invited you here

38
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,079
is simply because this place is carefree,

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,150
free from gossip.

40
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,160
There's no need to worry about anyone overhearing our conversation.

41
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,800
Even if someone accidentally overhears something,

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,230
it can all be considered the nonsense

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,410
of those living in a drunken dream.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,590
Mr. Wan is a wise person.

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,270
Please accept

46
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,450
my admiration.

47
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,930
Manager Yu, you're flattering me.

48
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,490
We are all just specks of dust in this world.

49
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,700
There's no need to admire me.

50
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,560
Alright.

51
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,560
Enough of small talk.

52

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

53
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,079
I won't claim to know everything,

54
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,750
but there's nothing in this martial world

55
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,110

61
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,550
Why do you come here every day?

62
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,980
I'm so bored.

63
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,620
I don't know where Ye Chen Xing is.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
He hasn't come to play with me.

65
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,550
I went to Lu Ming Garden to find him,

66
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,270
and he wasn't there either.

67
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,270
I'm bored to death at the Yu Mansion.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
What about Young Master?

69
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,680
This Yu Chao is worse.

70

He leaves early and returns late every day, all mysterious-like.

71
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,710
But it's also good this way.

72
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,250
He's not around, no one is watching me,

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,360
and I can enjoy some peace and quiet.

74
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,620
Oh, no.

75
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,020
Miss.

76
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,700
Could it be that the young master has someone outside?

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,830
Someone outside?

78
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,900
What do you mean?

79
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
Young Master has never been like this before.

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,830
What has Liu Ruoyu been up to lately?

81
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,460
Miss.

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,680
What are you thinking about?

83
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,830
Young Master and Liu Ruoyu are definitely impossible.

84
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,110
Besides,

85
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,430
these days, Liu Ruoyu

86
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,670
has been staying in her room all the time,

87
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,750
and even her meals are brought up by Liu Mengniang.

Wait.

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,180
What happened?

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,830

Who is Huo?

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,470

Didn't Uncle San say it was all a misunderstanding?

It's so scary.

109
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,650
I think he's after me.

Don't laugh.

113

What's wrong with him?

114
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,130
His way of pursuing is too dramatic.

115
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,190
Now, I feel so embarrassed in the Li Mansion

116
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,310
that I can't even face others.

117
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,450
It's good.

Isn't that the entertainment venue your family owns?

Early in the morning,

140

It was indeed you.

Did you come specifically for me?

Are you up to something? If not, I'm leaving.

00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,560
this isn't a place

160
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,040

I'm looking for someone.

162

of doing this business?

168
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,910
Auntie, why are you so naggy?

169
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,830
What?

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,030
Go back.

192
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,460
Go back and find a good man.

193
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,820
It's better not to have a man like him.

194
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,880
But I just want to see him.

195
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,080
Then I'll give up.

196
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,280
Sister, please let me go.

197
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,830
Lady Thirteen.

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,790
Come here.

199
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,930
Come here.

200
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,010
What's wrong?

201
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,970
This is Yu Xixi, the young lady of the Yu Family.

202
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,210
She is also a good friend of Miss Li Yun, our Manager's daughter.

203
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,740
Even Manager Yu himself dares not offend her.

204
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,040
What?

205
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,350
What do you think we should do?

206
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,530
In my opinion,

207
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,230
let's turn a blind eye to it.

208
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,270
It's hard for an honest official to settle family matters.

209
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,750
You're right.

210
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,240
Miss.

211
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,700
Go up.

212
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,430
Okay.

213
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,920
Drink this pot of Three Steps Down,

214
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,060
and a few sips will make you high as a kite.

215
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,160
What's going on?

216
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,970
I don't know.

217
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,110
Your friend?

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,920
No.

219
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,060
I thought she was your friend.

220
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,280
Keep going.

221
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,260
Don't mind me.

222
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,280
Do you know her?

223
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,610
I'll go deal with her.

224
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
Excuse me.

225
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,400
Miss.

226
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,660
I told you to keep quiet.

227
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,730
-I'd like to ask...
-Get lost!

228
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,870
Get lost!

229
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,450
In essence,

230
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,690
it was the Demon Boy Feng Zihe who fell into demonic cultivation,

231
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,990
causing alarm among the major sects.

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,670
As a result, those sects began to plan the siege of the Golden Blade Sect,

233
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,660
leading to the extermination of it.

234
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,660
I didn't expect that only a Feng Zihe

235
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,070
could instill such fear in the martial world.

236
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,510
After Feng Zihe fell into demonic cultivation,

237
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,150
demonic power infiltrated his entire body.

238
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,390
From then on, he lost his sanity and killed anyone he encountered.

239
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,760
At that time, many people from the major martial sects

240
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,140
died at the hands of this Demon Boy.

241
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,670
Some small sects

242
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,350
were even wiped out by him alone.

243
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,480
What about Feng Zihe?

244
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,950
It is said that he died.

245
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,810
At that time, the corpse was completely burnt,

246
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,140
and there was no way to identify it.

247
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,830
The only way to confirm it was Feng Zihe's body

248
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,040
was through the personal broadsword he carried.

249
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,450
What about

250
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,550
the Red Jade of Cangqiong on his body?

251
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,200
Manager Yu,

252
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,590
for the price you paid,

253
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,050
I can only tell you this much.

254
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,710
If you want me to say more...

255
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,090
There are two reasons.

256
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,310
First,

257
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,430
back then, the Golden Blade Sect

258
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,840
was destroyed by the joint attacks

259
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,950
of major sects.

260
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,670
So the disappeared Red Jade

261
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,790
may have been taken by remnants of the Golden Blade Sect.

262
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,330
What about the other possibility?

263
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,750
The other possibility

264
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,660
is that Feng Zihe, at that time,

265
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,290
didn't actually die.

266
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,610
He was saved,

267
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,850
and the Red Jade is still with him.

268
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,050
This is the most terrifying scenario.

269
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,640
Because everyone in the martial world knows that

270
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,900
the Red Jade of the Golden Blade Sect has been passed down to the eldest son.

271
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,080
Therefore, over the years, there have been people

272
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,720
secretly investigating the whereabouts of the Red Jade,

273
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,950
wanting to know

274
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,880
whether Feng Zihe really died.

275
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,620
After all, the person possessing the Red Jade

276
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,550
is highly likely to be Feng Zihe,

277
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,350
the Demon Boy.

278
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,730
Have you

279
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,250
ever seen Feng Zihe?

280
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,190
If Feng Zihe didn't die,

281
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,190
and you were to see him now, would you still recognize him?

282
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,560
What does that mean,

283
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,970
Manager Yu?

284
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,210
Nothing. I'm just asking.

285
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,610
I did encounter him

286
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,500
at a Martial Arts Competition once.

287
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,100
However, Feng Zihe was still young at that time.

288
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,630
Now, I probably

289
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,900
wouldn't recognize him.

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,010
Even if I do,

291
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,140
I can't say anything.

292
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,580
In our business,

293
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,830
it's better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

294
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,100
I want to inquire about another person.

295
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,870
Who is it?

296
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,410
Zang Muxiang.

297
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,830
Zang Muxiang?

298
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,050
Isn't that your mother?

299
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,300
I really don't know about that.

300
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
I, the Know-it-all,

301
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,260
am only well-informed in the martial world.

302
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,870
But I don't know

303
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,040
and don't want to know other things.

304
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,720
This is a portrait of my mother.

305
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,830
Does it ring a bell?

306
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,150
Manager Yu,

307
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,870
are you sure this is a portrait of your mother?

308
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,070
I'm sure.

309
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,400
The gaze seems familiar,

310
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,360
like I've seen it somewhere.

311
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,940
Especially the red mole at the center of her eyebrows.

312
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,160
It seems

313
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,070
I've seen her

314
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,670
at a Martial Arts Competition too.

315
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
She should be someone from the martial world.

316
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,350
The martial world?

317
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,220
Sir, take some more time to think.

318
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,270
How about this?

319
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,000
Leave this matter to me.

320
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,190
I'll ask around for you.

321
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,310
Then thank you, sir.

322
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,830
I will definitely reward you generously.

323
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,140
Regarding today's matter,

324
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,310
I hope you won't tell anyone.

325
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,350
Well then, Manager Yu,

326
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,120
let's continue drinking.

327
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,550
Please.

328
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,610
Good for you, Yu Zhao.

329
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,570
Miss.

330
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,870
Good wine matches a beautiful lady.

331
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,750
Today, if we don't share a drink,

332
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,320
it would be a waste of this fine day.

333
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,680
What are you blabbering about?

334
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,510
That's not true.

335
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,570
Enjoy the wine while we still have it.

336
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,260
Miss, you're a good drinker.

337
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,850
Miss, let me pour you another glass.

338
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,570
This girl.

339
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,630
Miss.

340
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Miss.

341
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,390
You are such a good drinker.

342
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,100
Let's sit down and talk about life

343
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,170
and dreams.

344
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,600
Bro, I really have something to do.

345
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,940
Miss, don't go.

346
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,450
Don't...

347
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,630
Yu Zhao!

348
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,630
Yu Zhao!

349
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,860
Miss, don't go.

350
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,690
Miss.

351
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,600
Let me assist you.

352
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,140
Let me assist you.

353
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,180
♫Autumn is coming and the wind ripples the pond♫

354
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,900

♫Your hair wraps around my finger♫

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,359
♫I wanted you to stay♫

Why did you go to such a place?

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,060
Am I not enough for you?

369
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,750
♫Though reluctant to part, what matters most is not being together every day♫

370
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,910
The other possibility

371
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,050
is that Feng Zihe, at that time,

372
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,670
didn't actually die.

373
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,010
He was saved,

374
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,270
and the Red Jade is still with him.

375
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,050
This is the most terrifying scenario.

376
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,160
After all, the person possessing the Red Jade

377
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,110
is highly likely to be Feng Zihe,

378
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,620
the Demon Boy.

379
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,750
Who am I?

380
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,570
I don't want to leave this vibrant life,

381
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,630
and I especially don't want to leave Yu Xixi.

382
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,890
[Yu Mansion]

383
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,950
Young Master.

384
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,080
What happened to Miss?

385
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,680
She's drunk.

386
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,190
What?

387
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,990
She's drunk?

388
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,350
Ghost!

389
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,690
Miss,

390
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,170
are you alright?

391
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,220
How much did you drink?

392
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,400
What caused you to drink so much?

393
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,090
Where am I?

394
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
This is Yu Mansion. You're home.

395
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,330
What Yu Mansion?

396
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,880
I don't want to stay here.

397
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,210
All right.

398
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Go back to sleep.

399
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,570
I'm so old.

400
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
Stop making me run.

401
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,110
Let go of me!

402
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,310
You look like a gentleman.

403
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,270
Unfortunately...

404
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,750
What?

405
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,310
Unfortunately,

406
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,050
you are a sanctimonious

407
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,630
and shameless villain!

408
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,630
What?

409
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,070
Miss, stop talking nonsense.

410
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,860
You're drunk.

411
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,110
Go back to sleep.

412
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,190
Young Master, don't take offense.

413
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,270
Don't take it to heart.

414
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,730
She didn't mean that.

415
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,790
No.

416
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,310
I meant exactly that.

417
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,190
That's, of course, what I meant.

418
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,740
Despite his impressive appearance,

419
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,620
he's nothing but a big scoundrel,

420
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,600
a pervert in his deeds.

421
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,160
Miss, stop it.

422
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,210
Go back to sleep.

423
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,070
Uncle San.

424
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,500
Do you know where I went today?

425
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,150
Where?

426
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,670
Yanyu Restaurant.

427
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,130
What?

428
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,520
Yanyu Restaurant?

429
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,630
Do you know who I saw?

430
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,870
Who?

431
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,780
Yu Zhao!

432
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,780
Manager Yu.

433
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,390
What?

434
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,750
At that time, the situation

435
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,350
was simply unbearable to hear

436
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
and unbearable to witness.

437
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,220
It was truly a reflection of the vicissitudes of the world,

438
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,920
and people's hearts were no longer as pure as before.

439
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,070
Enough, Miss.

440
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,510
Yanyu Restaurant is not a bad place.

441
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,120
It's not a brothel.

442
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,790
Isn't it simply an entertainment venue

443
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,910
run by Miss Li Yun's family?

444
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,110
Mother!

445
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,980
Yu Zhao is bullying me!

446
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,470
Let go of me!

447
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,330
Let go of me!

448
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,580
Let go!

449
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,790
She's finally asleep.

450
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,390
It seems

451
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,450
she has fallen into a deep sleep.

452
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
Go back and rest.

453
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,370
After all this fuss for tonight,

454
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,250
you must be tired.

455
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,000
Here,

456
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,140
both Xiang and I will keep an eye on her.

457
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,260
Yes, Young Master.

458
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,230
Don't go.

459
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,050
Stay with me.

460
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,990
Young Master.

461
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,150
How about you staying here

462
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,630
and keeping Miss company?

463
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,590
We...

464
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,650
won't disturb you any longer.

465
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,290
I'll take my leave now too, Young Master.

466
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,350
If you need anything, just call me.

467
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,380
Yu Zhao, don't go.

468
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,270
Stay with me.

469
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,390
I'm here.

470
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,610
I care about you so much.

471
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,300
Do I like you?

472
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,540
I really want to know.

473
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,920
We still have a lot of time.

474
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,590
But...

475
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,940
I feel so conflicted.

476
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,300
I really want to know soon.

477
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,550
Whenever

478
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,880
I see you with other women,

479
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,990
I feel uncomfortable.

480
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,920
I don't know why.

481
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,460
But I feel very uncomfortable.

482
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,110
I don't know why.

483
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,460
Don't worry.

484
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,930
It won't happen again.

485
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,900
Yu Zhao,

486
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,950
will you always be with me?

487
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,540
♫We dance all night♫

488
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,360
Of course.

489
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,830
Will you?

490
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,740
Tell me.

491
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:07,050
♫Midnight is the saddest time♫

492
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,150
I don't know.

493
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,950
Tell me you will.

494
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,110
Tell me.

495
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,960
♫All the splendor of life is gone in an instant♫

496
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,760
Tell me.

497
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,980
♫But the flowing water doesn't understand my feeling♫

498
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:26,470
♫There is nowhere for me to express my miss♫

499
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,140
♫I wish you and me are like the moon and the star♫

500
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,730
♫Which can dance together all night♫

501
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,160
♫So eager to spend the years ahead♫

502
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,550
♫With you and me, with songs, and the beauty of the wind and moon♫

503
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,800
♫Longing to capture the essence of spring completely♫

504
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,010
How did I come back yesterday?

505
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,270
What happened afterward?

506
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,390
Why can't I remember?

507
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,690
No way.

508
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,890
Oh my god.

509
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,740
This is bad. Yu Zhao is definitely going to give me trouble!

510
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,120
What the hell?

511
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,550
I...

512
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,220
This...

513
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,640
No way!

514
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,550
Miss, you are awake?

515
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:56,880
Here.

516
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,690
This is the sobering soup Young Master personally made for you.

517
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,470
Drink it while it's hot.

518
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,590
Yu Zhao?

519
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,690
He made it himself?

520
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,570
Yes.

521
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,530
Early this morning,

522
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,110
Young Master went to the kitchen

523
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,930
and spent a long time preparing it.

524
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,200
Where did Yu Chao spend the night last night?

525
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,390
Spend the night?

526
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,320
Tell me quickly.

527
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,270
In his own room, of course.

528
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,290
Yesterday, Young Master stayed here

529
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,190
until almost midnight.

530
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,360
Then he went back to his own room.

531
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,240
Then, who changed my clothes?

532
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,400
Me, of course.

533
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,630
Miss,

534
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,590
you came back last night reeking of alcohol.

535
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,460
That's good.

536
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,460
Why do I feel a bit disappointed, though?

537
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,140
Miss?

538
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,070
What's wrong?

539
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,550
Nothing.

540
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,110
Where is Yu Zhao now?

541
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,040
Young Master?

542
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,510
He went out with Jin Gang just now.

543
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,270
How come they are always sneaky?

544
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,750
Miss,

545
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,590
I have good news to tell you.

546
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,270
What good news?

547
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,990
Young Master has decided

548
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,010
to reopen the Jianghu Public House.

549
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,470
Moreover,

550
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,960
he has restored your managerial rights.

551
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,030
Really?

552
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,630
Of course.

553
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,830
Miss Li Yun has already contacted

554
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,730
the previous staff.

555
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,800
Everyone is willing to come back.

556
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,490
This Yu Zhao,

557
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,730
what is he up to?

558
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,790
Forget it.

559
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,710
As long as we can open, it's good enough.

560
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,990
By the way, Miss,

561
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,150
I'll go over and clean up with the staff later.

562
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,660
When you feel better,

563
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,530
go over too.

564
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,160
It's okay, I'll go over now.

565
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,870
