My dear,

64
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,710
where have you been?

65
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,400
Do you want me to die of anxiety?

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,790
Father.

67
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,579
I came back this time

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,180
to say goodbye.

69
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,910
Goodbye...

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,430
No.

71
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,910
You...

72
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,310
You just came back.

73
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,840
Why are you leaving again?

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,160
I'm going to save someone. Father.

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,190
Yu Xixi has already set off.

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,640
I must go too.

77
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,080
Hey.

78
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,070
Last time you ran away from home, you didn't even say goodbye.

79
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,310
This time,

80
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,310
You...

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,300
You said goodbye to me.

82
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,390
This time is different.

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,209
Maybe this time...

84
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,510
Father.

85
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,550
If I didn't come back on time,

86
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,420
just pretend that you never had me as your daughter.

87
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,270
I...

88
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,030
You...

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,550
I...

90
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,320
Listen.

91
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Your mother died early.

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,550
Since you were young,

93
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,040
I have put in a lot of effort

94
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,230
to bring you up.

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,310
You can do whatever you want.

96
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,190
Tell me.

97
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,210
You want to practice martial arts,

98
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,650
I let you practice martial arts.

99
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,630
You don't want to go on a blind date,

100
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,750
then we won't go on blind dates.

101
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,130
Right?

102
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,070
But this time...

103
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,190
No.

104
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,090
You can't go.

105
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,790
Father.

106
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,730
No.

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,470
You can't leave Li Mansion today.

108
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,790
Guards!

109
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,020
Stop her!

110
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,310
Father.

111
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,590
Looks like I can only break out today.

112
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,320
Stop!

113
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,420
Get down.

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Today,

115
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,490
whatever I say won't work, right?

116
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:51,920
Right.

117
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,240
This is really important to me.

118
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,420
For

119
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,350
that Huo, right?

120
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,220
Huo is the person I love.

121
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,160
He behaves strangely

122
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,830
and abnormally.

123
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,790
He's younger than me,

124
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,800
but he always pretends to be older.

125
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,360
But I don't know why

126
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,400
I'm very attracted.

127
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,110
Maybe I've never met

128
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,640
such an interesting person.

129
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,870
Father.

130
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,909
At first, he kept pestering me

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,909
and bothering me.

132
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,930
But one day,

133
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,680
I got used to it.

134
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,390
It's really scary to get used to something.

135
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,990
I can't quit at all.

136
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,760
I found that I couldn't live without him.

137
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,670
Now that he's taken away,

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,590
I feel empty.

139
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,810
Father.

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,940
I must save him.

141
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,390
Jin Gang. Thank you.

142
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,910
It's okay.

143
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,720
Is he still sleeping?

144
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,910
Can he do it or not?

145
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,960
Keep your voice down.

146
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,670
Mr. Chen is the number one

147
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,470
in the list of killers.

148
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,510
Don't judge a book by its cover.

149
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,550
No.1?

150
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,270
Is he the one

151
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,430
who made the list?

152
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,500
Look at him.

153
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,920
It's not good to talk behind someone's back.

154
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,240
Mr. Chen, you're awake.

155
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,310
I don't want to wake up either.

156
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,550
But you two are talking about me so loudly.

157
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,600
I can't ignore it.

158
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,030
What are you two doing?

159
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,110
I see.

160
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,410
Go on.

161
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,470
What do you know?

162
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,680
Look at your weak face.

163
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,450
If I find out you're a liar,

164
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
I'll kill you.

165
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,860
Why do you use bad language to insult me?

166
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,630
I didn't offend you.

167
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,110
You didn't?

168
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,030
Didn't you see that I'm billing and cooing?

169
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,520
Don't you think you shouldn't be here?

170
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,050
I...

171
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,850
But I have nowhere else to go.

172
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,630
You shouldn't be in the car.

173
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,750
Sleep.

174
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
Miss. Please continue.

175
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,960
Mengniang.

176
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,390
Why don't you go in?

177
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,110
The wind is strong here.

178
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,380
I won't go in.

179
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,750
What's wrong?

180
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,360
Inside...

181
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,760
Sit tight.

182
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,910
Miss Liu.

183
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,190
Well...

184
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,790
Stop talking.

185
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,110
I told you not to talk.

186
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,110
Thank you.

187
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,930
Thank you for coming with me to save Yu Zhao.

188
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,110
I'm not doing this for you.

189
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,030
I'm going to save my Zihe.

190
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,470
Okay.

191
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,310
By the way,

192
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,120
since you and Yu Zhao are childhood sweethearts,

193
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,710
do you know a lot about his childhood...

194
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,460
Yu Xixi.

195
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,320
Are you done?

196
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm bored. Just chat with me.

197
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,830
I don't think we have anything to talk about.

198
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm going to save

199
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,060
my childhood friend Feng Zihe.

200
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,570
As for your Yu Zhao,

201
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,700
I know nothing.

202
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,450
Isn't Yu Zhao Feng Zihe?

203
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,880
You...

204
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,430
Stop!

205
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,990
Stop!

206
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,550
Stop!

207
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,230
I didn't expect you to be so enthusiastic.

208
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,230
Yu Xixi.

209
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,460
I'll go down and take a look.

210
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,350
This...

211
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,980
I...

212
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,030
I...

213
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,880
I own this mountain.

214
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,780
I own all these trees.

215
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,270
if you want to

216
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,830
pass...

217
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,280
Sister bandit...

218
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,510
Wait!

219
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,790
I need to finish the opening speech.

220
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,940
My...

221
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,800
My brothers are watching.

222
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,010
No, no, no. We're in a hurry.

223
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,730
No, no, no.

224
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,680
We...

225
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,590
We...

226
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,990
We bandits

227
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,350
have...

228
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,990
We bandits have integrity.

229
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,670
Okay, go on.

230
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,430
I own this mountain.

231
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,440
I own all these trees.

232
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,030
If you want to pass through this zone,

233
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,150
you've got to pay for it.

234
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,350
Sister bandit.

235
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,530
This is all we have.

236
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,760
Let us go over.

237
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,670
Vice Master.

238
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,750
How about you take a break?

239
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,630
You use sign language and I'll translate it for you.

240
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,370
She said okay.

241
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,800
Thank you.

242
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,670
Well,

243
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,070
Vice Master said that

244
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,580
with such a good carriage,

245
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,710
how could you have such little money?

246
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,670
If you really don't have money,

247
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,910
you two girls look good...

248
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,600
If we sell you to Yanyu Restaurant,

249
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,050
maybe we can get more money.

250
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,330
Keep that for me.

251
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,840
Brothers, go!

252
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,210
Stop!

253
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,370
What are you doing?

254
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,850
Do you know who we are?

255
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,700
No.

256
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,340
You'll be scared if I tell you.

257
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,190
Did you see the one sleeping in the carriage?

258
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,410
His nickname is the Killer Scholar.

259
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,530
The one next to him is

260
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,010
Dwarf Sword King.

261
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,030
And the one next to him

262
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,540
is Heroine Round.

263
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,870
There's another one

264
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,390
in the car.

265
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,870
Black Mountain Old Demon.

266
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,240
Yu Xi...

267
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,420
And I am

268
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,030
Heroine Invincible.

269
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,750
Are you scared?

270
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,110
What are you talking about?

271
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,110
Who are you trying to scare?

272
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,710
Brothers, go!

273
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,380
Wait!

274
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,550
What do you want to do again?

275
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,530
No other solutions?

276
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,630
Cut the crap.

277
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,270
Let me get ready.

278
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,290
Get...

279
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,060
Here you are.

280
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,260
You should have done this earlier.

281
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,300
I'll work if you pay.

282
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,320
Brothers, go!

283
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,430
Who are you?

284
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,030
How dare you kidnap my friend?

285
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,600
I'll kill you all.

286
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,540
Oh my!

287
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,190
Xixi, I'm here to save you.

288
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,630
Yunyun. You're so handsome.

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,180
Qiang is going to lose.

290
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,830
Let's go.

291
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,670
Here you are.

292
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,750
Do you want it?

293
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,430
No.

294
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,070
You want it?

295
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,630
Do you want more?

296
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,630
You want it?

297
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,030
Do you want it?

298
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,440
No! No!

299
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,110
Don't move!

300
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,520
How dare you act wildly in my territory!

301
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,110
You are surrounded.

302
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,870
Qiang.

303
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,390
Don’t be afraid.

304
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,790
You beat Qiang.

305
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,240
No one can leave.

306
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,410
Miss Yu.

307
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,390
You are...

308
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,350
Yes.

309
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
We met before in Yu Mansion.

310
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:09,910
And him.

311
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,770
Are you

312
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,650
a bandit now?

313
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,070
Well,

314
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,130
let me formally introduce myself.

315
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,620
The leader of Whirlwind Stronghold.

316
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,620
Wang Zheng.

317
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,590
This is my sister, Wang Qiang.

318
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,860
the vice master of Whirlwind Stronghold.

319
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,630
This area

320
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,250
is under our control.

321
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
You're in charge of this area?

322
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,350
When I'm free.

323
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,910
A sideline.

324
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,620
Why are you doing this now?

325
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,710
The harvest hasn't been very good in the past two years.

326
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,270
We have some skills,

327
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,040
so we came out and explore the matial arts world.

328
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,990
No wonder you look different

329
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,600
from when you were in Yu Mansion.

330
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,850
Business needs.

331
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,230
Clothing must match the profession, right?

332
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,300
Guys, this is Miss Yu.

333
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,630
She's one of us.

334
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,680
We don't rob people on our own side.

335
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,380
Take all the weapons.

336
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,720
You...

337
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,310
Where are you going?

338
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,110
We're going to Lu Ming Manor

339
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,330
to save our manager.

340
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,790
Really?

341
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,670
Awesome.

342
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,220
I admire you.

343
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,300
Impressive.

344
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,540
Miss Yu.

345
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,780
That day, you said

346
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,610
you would go to Lu Ming Manor to save your lover.

347
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,000
I thought you were joking.

348
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,590
I didn't expect you to keep your word.

349
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,450
Are you really going

350
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
with just a few people?

351
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,150
I'm convinced.

352
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,920
Since you've decided,

353
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,190
I will

354
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,630
see you off.

355
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,330
Brothers, serve the wine.

356
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,280
No, no, no.

357
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,980
Don't do that.

358
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,210
Jin Gang.

359
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,710
These 100 taels are my private possession.

360
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,579
I was originally thinking of using it on the way

361
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,990
to avoid unexpected needs.

362
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,240
Look at you.

363
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,710
Why must you be a bandit?

364
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,050
This money is enough for you

365
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,200
to open a restaurant or something in Xianyun City.

366
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,900
If you need anything, go to Yu Mansion and find Uncle San.

367
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,130
Tell him I asked you to find him.

368
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,110
He will definitely help you.

369
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,240
Miss Yu.

370
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,060
I will never forget your kindness.

371
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,510
Although I can't go through fire and water

372
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,720
with you,

373
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,550
But I, Wang Zheng,

374
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,390
will wait for you to come back.

375
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,510
Okay. But when I come back,

376
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,390
if you're still a bandit,

377
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,490
I won't see you.

378
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,270
Okay.

379
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,330
Take care.

380
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,910
Master.

381
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,510
Yu Xixi is on the way

382
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
to our manor.

383
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,620
So early/

384
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,430
Okay.

385
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,580
Keep an eye on their whereabouts.

386
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,820
Report to me if anything happens.

387
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,550
Yes.

388
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,580
You may leave.

389
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,270
Please go into the trap.

390
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,150
Lu Ming Manor.

391
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,630
It should be inside here.

392
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,740
What's the sound?

393
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,310
The chirping of deer.

394
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,790
The chirping of deer?

395
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:18,950
Is it because Master Ye

396
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,930
likes the chirping of deer

397
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,390
that it's called Lu Ming Manor.

398
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,310
Across the bank a deer bleats, in the wild where it eats.

399
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,750
Honored my guests I salute, strike the harp! Play the flute!

400
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,790
Lu Ming is an ancient song.

401
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,230
It's a song sung by the ancients at the banquet.

402
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,870
So Lu Ming also has the significance of loving virtuous individuals

403
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,950
and is a symbol of benevolence.

404
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,170
Master Ye has recruited many followers in the world,

405
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,480
so he named the manor as Lu Ming Manor.

406
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,200
How can we get in?

407
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,070
All the guests who entered the manor

408
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,350
will be put on eyeshades

409
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,480
and be brought in by people from Lu Ming Manor.

410
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,950
We may be the first one to barge in.

411
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,910
Forget it. Let's go.

412
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:56,710
Jin Gang.

413
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,230
Go! Wealth!

414
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,560
Let's get in the car.

415
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:00,910
Let's go.

416
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,510
[Lu Ming Manor]

417
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,330
Why is there no one here?

418
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,830
Where are traps?

419
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,590
Master Ye is so cautious.

420
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,600
Why is he so careless this time?

421
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,030
Isn't it good that no one is here?

422
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,120
Let's go and save the young master.

423
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,990
Wait.

424
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,500
Please wait here.

425
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,890
I can go alone.

426
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,470
You go alone?

427
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,020
To be exact, I'll go with my dog.

428
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,510
You just need to wait for me here.

429
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,870
I'll bring him out and we'll leave immediately.

430
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,950
Especially Miss Li.

431
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
You must be tired

432
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
riding horses all the way.

433
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,570
I'm already a little worried.

434
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,310
You must rest well.

435
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,110
Another crazy guy.

436
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,230
It won't take more than an hour

437
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,250
to save one person.

438
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,320
The show starts now.

439
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,750
Wait.

440
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,810
Who told you to save only one person?

441
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,350
Aren't we only saving Manager Yu?

442
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,500
Four.

443
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,310
Four?

444
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,570
You need to pay more.

445
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,070
Our initial agreement was that

446
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,430
we would only save Manager Yu.

447
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,870
No.

448
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,680
What now?

449
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,150
Well, get them all out.

450
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,860
We'll give you all the money you need, right?

451
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,880
If Miss Li asked me to do so,

452
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:14,870
I wouldn't charge you.

453
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,610
Consider it a gift for Miss Li.

454
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,270
Who are the other three?

455
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,080
Two old men, one fat and one thin.

456
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,580
And a young man.

457
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,130
He is seven feet tall and very burly.

458
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,810
A young man?

459
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,240
He is...

460
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,290
He's my...

461
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,130
Cousin.

462
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,430
Her cousin.

463
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,830
They're so close.

464
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,070
My cousin.

465
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,250
Mr. Chen, stop dawdling.

466
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,100
Go and save them.

467
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,070
Okay.

468
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,600
Jin Gang.

469
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,250
When you hear me learn cicada chirping,

470
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,460
meet me under the wall.

471
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,800
Okay.

472
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,350
I'll be right back.

473
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,470
Don't worry.

474
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,510
How is Yu Xixi doing?

475
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,510
They're outside the manor.

476
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,350
Not bad.

477
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,830
They managed to pass through the maze.

478
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,310
I was worried that

479
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,040
they couldn't find the way to the manor.

480
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,100
I wanted to let Chenxing

481
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,270
guide her.

482
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,070
Now it's easier.

483
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,710
What are they doing now?

484
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
One of them

485
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,670
has entered Lu Ming Manor

486
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,790
and is rushing to the back room where Young Master Feng is locked.

487
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,700
Have you arranged everything properly there?

488
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,390
Don't worry, nothing will go wrong.

489
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,040
Anything else?

490
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,350
I have a question.

491
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,780
Tell me.

492
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,110
Why do you want Yu Xixi to rescue Young Master Feng

493
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,550
and ordered the servants

494
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,960
to only chase after her without fighting.

495
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,910
You...

496
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,110
This is the point.

497
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,150
If I lock Yu Zhao up

498
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,050
or let him die,

499
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,080
then

500
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,060
I will never know

501
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,390
Yu Xixi's identity.

502
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,030
I want Yu Xixi to save Yu Zhao.

503
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,560
I will keep pushing them

504
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,670
and stimulating them.

505
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,250
I want to see

506
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,140
what secret they are hiding.

507
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,510
You’re brilliant.

508
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,300
By the way,

509
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,350
how are the young master and Ye Mo?

510
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,470
They've been practicing swordsmanship all day long.

511
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,230
Keep an eye on the young master.

512
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,910
The young master

513
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,780
will be useful soon.
