00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,800
Miss, you got up so early.

6
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,130
That's good.

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,150
As we should.

8
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,640
Go to bed early and wake up early.

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,030
Today's weather

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,120
is so nice, isn't it?

11
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,430
Miss.

12
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,090
Could you please

13
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,070
say more than one word?

14
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,960
Alright.

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,110
You can continue speaking like this.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,079
What's... wrong?

17
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,960
I... don't... know.

18
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,670
Miss.

19
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,510
I heard

20
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,620
that Young Master came specially...

21
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,630
Uncle San, get me another pair of chopsticks.

22
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,710
Young Master.

23
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,270
Young Master.

24
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,720
Did you sleep well last night?

25
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,590
Yesterday was the Lantern Festival,

26
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,640
and our Huixian Restaurant had a great turnout.

27
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,630
Good.

28
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,430
Did you see the lantern show yesterday?

29
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,300
No.

30
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,710
Why are you also...

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,180
Jin Gang.

32
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,290
Take the food to my room.

33
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,990
I lose my appetite when I see someone.

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,810
Let's go back to our room too!

35
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,050
I can't eat when I see someone too!

36
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,460
Miss!

37
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,070
Young Master,

38
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,830
you've been smiling

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
since this morning.

40
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,500
I don't think that's necessary.

41
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,910
Whatever.

42
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,980
Did you find anything

43
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,430
when you went out with Yu Xixi last night?

44
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,060
None at all.

45
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,790
What did you do all night?

46
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,110
Playing.

47
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,190
Playing?

48
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,960
Young Master, if you keep like this,

49
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,890
I really can't cover for you in front of Master.

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,600
OK. I know. I know.

51
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,350
Mo, look at you.

52
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,670
I have to earn

53
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,230
the trust of Yu Xixi, one step at a time.

54
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,830
Young Master, let me remind you again.

55
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,760
Don't...

56
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,470
I know.

57
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,390
Really fall in love with her.

58
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,900
Don't worry.

59
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,130
That's all acting.

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,700
I don’t think so.

61
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,150
You know what will happen

62
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
when the master gets angry.

63
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,470
I know my father.

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,930
Don't worry.

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,520
In this matter,

66
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,790
we should take it

67
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:05,730
very

68
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,940
slow.

69
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,020
We can't take it slow.

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,900
Alright, alright.

71
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm going to see Yu Xixi today.

72
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,830
I can assure you

73
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,070
that within three days,

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,350
Yu Xixi

75
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,270
will truly

76
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,870
fall in love with me.

77
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,680
My little fool.

78
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,390
Uncle San, what do you want?

79
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,180
Come on.

80
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,990
What do you want?

81
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,990
What is the young master doing now?

82
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,860
Young Master?

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,270
What's wrong?

84
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,420
He is in his room.

85
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,350
Is that all?

86
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,150
It's noon now.

87
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,560
He's been staying in his room

88
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,750
since morning?

89
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,550
Yes.

90
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,470
Xiang.

91
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,560
What about Miss?

92
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,870
Miss?

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,430
Nothing unusual.

94
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,590
Miss!

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,630
Miss.

96
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,050
Call me when it's lunchtime.

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,910
Something is wrong.

98
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,110
What's wrong?

99
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,120
It's too quiet.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,430
Isn't it good?

101
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,830
It's the quiet that makes me feel strange.

102
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,350
Do you think Uncle San is old

103
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,670
and that's why he acts all gaga?

104
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,940
Is it worth making such a fuss

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,120
when Miss and Young Master have had a fight?

106
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah.

107
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,090
It's not the first time.

108
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,680
That's right.

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,210
It must be his brain...

110
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,260
What are you two muttering about?

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
Nothing, nothing.

112
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,040
Uncle San, I have to go back to work.

113
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,390
I gotta go.

114
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,830
He has gone gaga.

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,280
He must be.

116
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,800
I guess it's because

117
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,390
he has been single for all these years.

118
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,310
Definitely.

119
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,990
How about we find him a wife?

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,030
Where can we find one?

121
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,860
At Miss Li Yun’s Yanyu Restaurant.

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,040
What's going on?

123
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,030
Uncle San, Liu Ruoyu is here.

124
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,260
Why is she here

125
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,560
at this critical moment?

126
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,110
Zihe.

127
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,990
What brings you here?

128
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,890
Are you still mad about what happened yesterday?

129
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,310
You came all the way here to apologize to me?

130
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,070
I'm here to check in on you.

131
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,559
Anyhow,

132
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,630
you're a prominent figure in Xianyun City.

133
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,130
Yesterday, Yu Xixi was shamelessly with another man.

134
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,150
I'm afraid you'd be humiliated.

135
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,330
Thank you for your concern.

136
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,750
This is a family matter.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,940
I'll handle it myself.

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
Zihe.

139
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,510
You have feelings for her, but she doesn't reciprocate them.

140
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,350
You can’t force it.

141
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,010
You're a smart man.

142
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,230
There are plenty of girls in the world.

143
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,590
Zihe.

144
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,930
Think about what I said.

145
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,230
Maybe she doesn't have you

146
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,340
in her heart.

147
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,630
If there's nothing else,

148
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,810
please go back.

149
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,270
Let me help you.

150
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,330
Miss Liu.

151
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,650
What's wrong?

152
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,260
I'll think about what you said.

153
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,580
Really?

154
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,830
Let me see you off.

155
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,850
Miss! Miss!

156
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,620
Calm down!

157
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,390
Don't stop me.

158
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,230
Did you see what he's doing?

159
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,410
He's been asking me not to see other men.

160
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
But he is with another girl.

161
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,390
Zihe.

162
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,680
You can go back now.

163
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,550
Let's find out what's going on first.

164
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,590
Is that not clear enough?

165
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,990
I see them with my own eyes.

166
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,950
Miss, calm down.

167
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,630
I'm calm.

168
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,790
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

169
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,630
I am so calm.

170
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,750
Miss.

171
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,830
Let go of me!

172
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,300
Yu Zhao!

173
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,540
What do you mean by that?

174
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,820
What do you mean?

175
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,550
Stop acting.

176
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,740
What is your deal with Liu Ruoyu?

177
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,070
Are you meddling in my business?

178
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,600
You don't want me to meddle in your business.

179
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,670
Then you should leave me alone too.

180
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,550
You...

181
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,190
Fine.

182
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,240
You don't meddle in my business, and I won't meddle in yours.

183
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,190
We have nothing to do with each other.

184
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,660
Then don't stop me when I go out.

185
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,480
Suit yourself.

186
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,480
I...

187
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,790
Fine.

188
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,190
Miss!

189
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,830
From now on,

190
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,270
she can go wherever she wants.

191
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,140
Don't stop her.

192
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,590
Do you hear him?

193
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,590
Yes.

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
Young Master, Miss...

195
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:01,960
Uncle San.

196
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,350
She is not a child anymore.

197
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,510
Don't worry.

198
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,630
But...

199
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,660
This...

200
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,810
Send someone to keep an eye on her and protect her.

201
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,790
Young Master, what are you...

202
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,070
Do as you're told.

203
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,570
Yes.

204
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,670
Leave it to me.

205
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,470
Alright.

206
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,830
Don't be so gloomy.

207
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,100
Think on the bright side.

208
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,360
At least you can

209
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,660
go in and out of Yu Mansion all you want.

210
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,950
I know.

211
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,550
But I just can't be happy.

212
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,690
By the way,

213
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,790
what about your bet with Yu Zhao?

214
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
It's still on.

215
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,790
Although he still pays me every day,

216
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,910
it's not enough to cover my debt.

217
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,470
After three months,

218
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,050
are you really going to marry him?

219
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,020
What else can I do?

220
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,990
He won't let me reopen the Jianghu Public House.

221
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,710
You must not lose your will to fight.

222
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,760
Think about it.

223
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,070
He's so in love

224
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,070
with Liu Ruoyu.

225
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,120
If he marries Liu Ruoyu

226
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,720
and makes her his legal wife,

227
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,870
-you will...
-No way.

228
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,470
Yu Zhao won't marry Liu Ruoyu.

229
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,270
Are you that sure?

230
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,270
Are you done?

231
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,480
Enjoy yourself. I'm leaving.

232
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,060
No, no, no.

233
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,770
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,470
I mean,

235
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,670
do you need my help?

236
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,790
You help me?

237
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,290
Yes.

238
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,070
How can you help me?

239
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,550
If Yu Zhao finds out about this,

240
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,440
he will be even more pissed.

241
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,790
Let me think about it.

242
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,950
There must be a way.

243
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,010
Anyway, there are still two months left

244
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,170
before the bet is settled.

245
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,350
We have plenty of time.

246
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,670
We'll see.

247
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,350
All right, stop frowning.

248
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,390
The tavern

249
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm about to take you to

250
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,190
has the best food

251
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,580
I've ever had.

252
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,830
Xixi!

253
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,170
Xixi!

254
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,390
Young Master, are you alright?

255
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,830
I'm fine. Save Xixi.

256
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,970
Stop chasing.

257
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,400
Who are you?

258
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,590
It's none of your business.

259
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,960
Do you know who I am?

260
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't care who you are.

261
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,750
You...

262
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,150
You go save Xixi.

263
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,930
I'll distract him.

264
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,640
Young Master,

265
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,830
he is no ordinary man.

266
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,170
You're no match for him.

267
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,070
I'll stall him.

268
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,930
Be careful.

269
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,850
You're good.

270
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,800
I haven't been this excited in a long time.

271
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,630
What's your name? Tell me.

272
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,590
I won't kill an unnamed man.

273
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,950
You have no manners.

274
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
Good swordsmanship.

275
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,590
But I'm not bad either.

276
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
You don't have a sword anymore.

277
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,870
It's not fair if I continue.

278
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,950
But you are the first man

279
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,950
who can go a few rounds with me in a fight.

280
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,630
I'm just too distracted today.

281
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,230
Let's fight another day.

282
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,200
Yu Zhao.

283
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,910
I hate the feeling

284
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,410
that you're always telling me what to do!

285
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm not your wife

286
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,750
or your biological sister.

287
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,010
Who are you to tell me what to do every day?

288
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Yu Xixi!

289
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,150
I see now.

290
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,830
You're used to treating me as your subordinate

291
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,080
and letting me live at your mercy

292
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,990
because of your pride and possessiveness!

293
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,020
Enough!

294
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,860
I've had enough of you, Yu Zhao.

295
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,050
I'm telling you today.

296
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,750
I'll cut you off!

297
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,590
Who I go out with is none of your business!

298
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,750
Whether it's Ye Chenxing or Ma Chenxing,

299
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,590
it has nothing to do with you.

300
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,670
Young Master.

301
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,510
Something is wrong!

302
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,430
Slow down.

303
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,350
Someone reported

304
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,450
that Miss had been kidnapped.

305
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,110
What?

306
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,030
After Miss left here, she went to Lu Ming Manor.

307
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,200
She came out

308
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,870
with Ye Chenxing and Ye Mo.

309
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,870
A group of people suddenly appeared

310
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,310
and took Miss away without a word!

311
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,790
Did you see who they were?

312
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,940
It appears to be a group of swordsmen.

313
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,560
The leader is a boy wearing a mask.

314
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,190
Sir,

315
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,390
please do me a favor.

316
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,430
You are Manager Yu.

317
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,500
A boy with a mask?

318
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,230
Young Master! Something bad has happened!

319
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,110
We found an arrow on the door.

320
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,070
Young Master! Young Master!

321
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,620
Stop!

322
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,440
Are you done?

323
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,030
Let her go!

324
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,510
It's none of your business.

325
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,030
Go away.

326
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Do what you should do.

327
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,870
You have to do this the hard way, right?

328
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,390
I'll show you thieves

329
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,390
the power of the Lu Ming Sword Skill!

330
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,460
He is nothing.

331
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,270
Young Master, what should we do with him?

332
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,589
Take him with us as well.

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,040
Yes, take them away.

334
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,470
Do you know who I am?

335
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm Ye Chenxing, the young master of Lu Ming Manor.

336
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,369
You're a deer farmer. Why are you so proud?

337
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,430
How did this happen?

338
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,990
If anything happens,

339
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,830
I...

340
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,480
How should I…

341
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,650
Young Master.

342
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,990
Where are you?

343
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,160
You must stay safe.

344
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,750
Uncle San!

345
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
Miss Li, you're here.

346
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,430
Miss Li came to help.

347
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,350
Miss Li, thank you.

348
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,520
Uncle San, forget it.

349
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,710
What's the latest news?

350
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,130
No, I can't wait any longer.

351
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,990
I have to go save my young master.

352
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,510
Jin Gang!

353
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,850
Jin Gang!

354
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,710
Jin Gang!

355
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,290
Where are you going?

356
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,270
At this time,

357
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,070
we need to calm down

358
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,950
and think about it.

359
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,310
Uncle San,

360
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,640
did Manager Yu leave any clues

361
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,790
before he left?

362
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,390
Nothing.

363
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,990
After reading the letter from the kidnapper,

364
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
he went out immediately.

365
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,050
He didn't show it to anyone.

366
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,270
Why?

367
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,260
I know.

368
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,230
The kidnapper must have threatened Young Master,

369
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,480
using our Miss as leverage to go to them alone.

370
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,670
So,

371
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,070
the kidnappers' target this time

372
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,200
is not Xixi.

373
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,910
So,

374
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,490
Miss is safe.

375
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,550
Then Young Master is definitely not safe!

376
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,270
Jin Gang.

377
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,870
Can you calm down?

378
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,710
We must think about

379
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,140
whether there is another way

380
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,310
to find out

381
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,580
Manager Yu and Xixi's current location.

382
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,550
Is there a way?

383
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,540
Another way?

384
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,590
GPS!

385
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,390
What?

386
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,260
Young Master!

387
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,250
Where is Young Master? Is he back?

388
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,280
He hasn't come back yet.

389
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,320
Let's go.

390
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,350
Take some men with me to Yu Mansion and look for Yu Zhao.

391
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,360
It was Yu Zhao who did it?

392
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,750
Maybe Yu Zhao can help.

393
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,070
It's you again.

394
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,760
What do you want?

395
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,610
Hand over the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

396
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,680
Otherwise,

397
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
she'll be dead.

398
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,280
You don't remember?

399
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,800
Stop pretending.

400
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,900
The one from that auction.

401
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,030
I remember it. So?

402
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,370
The Red Jade of Cangqiong I'm looking for

403
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,600
has a phoenix in the center.

404
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,270
But this one is a carp.

405
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,660
I guess the phoenix one

406
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,640
is on you.

407
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,270
Give it to me!

408
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,960
If I do it,

409
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
you'll let them go?

410
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,940
You have my word.

411
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,150
Okay.

412
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,790
I didn't bring it with me.

413
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,890
But I can go back and get it for you.

414
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,070
You played me?

415
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,520
The message I gave you

416
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,590
is to come alone to save her

417
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,750
with the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

418
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,430
How would I know what the Red Jade of Cangqiong is?

419
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,550
You have to do it the hard way.

420
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,190
Fine.

421
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,820
What do you want?

422
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,350
I said I'd get it for you!

423
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,490
You have lied to me once.

424
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,520
You have to pay the price.

425
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,890
Don't you dare touch her!

426
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't you look at me like that!

427
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,750
Fine.

428
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,970
I'll kill you now

429
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,600
and then raze your house to the ground!

430
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,480
I will find the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

431
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,450
Boss, are you okay?

432
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,580
Blindfold him. Hurry!

433
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,440
Yes.

434
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,460
Done, boss.

435
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,920
Set this place on fire!

436
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,140
I don't believe I can't kill you!

437
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,480
If I die, you will never get the Red Jade of Cangqiong!

438
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,380
I'll find it myself!

439
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,630
Xixi!

440
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,640
Xixi!

441
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,760
Boss, the door is blocked.

442
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,880
He can't escape.

443
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,470
Xixi.

444
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,390
Xixi!

445
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,350
Wake up, Xixi!

446
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,510
Wake up!

447
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,390
Xixi.

448
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,870
Xixi.

449
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,080
Watch out!

450
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,530
Young Master and Miss should be in there.

451
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,770
Put out the fire!

452
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,110
Brothers, stop fighting!

453
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,030
Withdraw!

454
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,290
This man is so strange.

455
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,060
Young Master.

456
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,320
Miss.

457
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,420
Young Master!

458
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Hurry! Put out the fire!

459
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,030
Young Master!

460
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,010
Xixi.

461
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,270
You must be alive.

462
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,400
Without you,

463
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,110
what's the point of me living?

464
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,110
[Yu Mansion]

465
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,840
Xixi.

466
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,830
Xixi!

467
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,790
Uncle San.

468
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,710
Young Master, you're finally awake.

469
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,450
You scared me. You were out all night.

470
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,030
Young Master!

471
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,140
Young Master!

472
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:37,830
His clothes.

473
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,830
♫Autumn is coming and the wind ripples the pond♫

474
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,270
Young Master!

475
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,500
Young Master!

476
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,540
♫I don't know♫

477
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,680
Young Master, you're awake.

478
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,720
♫I know, the water flows east, and the moon rises in the west♫

479
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,910
How is Xixi?

480
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,510
Don't worry, Young Master.

481
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,430
The doctor said

482
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,100
♫All remains the same♫

483
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,910
that Miss is fine.

484
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,670
She just had too many knockout drops

485
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,180
♫Your hair wraps around my finger♫

486
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,080
and was shocked.

487
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,190
That's why she is in a coma.

488
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,950
Fortunately, after taking some medicine

489
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,910
♫I'm lost in my dream and I don't know anything♫

490
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,790
and resting for a few days,

491
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,710
she will recover.

492
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,260
♫After having a drink, you left♫

493
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,010
♫I wanted you to stay♫

494
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,450
You may leave.

495
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:17,100
♫Silly, sentimental lover in this mortal realm♫

496
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,720
♫Drizzling raindrops in the coolness of an autumn night♫

497
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:34,620
♫Mountains have trees, and trees have branches♫

498
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:42,640
♫I love you, but you are unaware♫

499
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,790
♫How many partings and reunions on the divine mountain♫

500
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,910
♫Though reluctant to part, what matters most is not being together every day♫

501
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,350
Xixi, I'm sorry.

502
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,360
I failed to protect you.

503
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,520
Master, you’re here.

504
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,430
Father.

505
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
It's good that you're fine.

506
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,390
Kneel.

507
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,870
I said, "Kneel."

508
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,650
OK.

509
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,600
Master, no.

510
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,630
The young master has just recovered. He's still weak.

511
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,750
Step aside.

512
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,630
Master.

513
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,030
Get out of the way!

514
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,870
Master.

515
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,470
I am also responsible

516
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,500
for what happened to Young Master this time.

517
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm willing to accept the punishment on behalf of the young master.

518
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,440
Master,

519
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,790
please punish me as well.

520
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,310
Who

521
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,800
are those people?

522
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,520
We don't know yet.

523
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,590
But

524
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,580
they seem to be coming after Yu Zhao.

525
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,600
You don't know?

526
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,990
Chenxing.

527
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,910
I'll give you one last chance.

528
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,420
You have to ensure

529
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,880
that the red jade Yu Zhao has

530
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,410
is the Red Jade of Cangqiong that we are looking for.

531
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,750
If you fail again,

532
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,670
you know the consequences.
