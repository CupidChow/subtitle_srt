[Episode 19]

4
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,500
The dishes are ready.

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,070
There's no wine.

6
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,990
In the kitchen, there's some fine Daughter's Red

7
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,270
left from before.

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,220
I'll go get it.

9
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,650
Uncle San.

10
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:02,830
There's no need.

11
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,850
Save it for tomorrow.

12
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,280
For tomorrow?

13
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,970
For what?

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,320
Firstly,

15
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,860
thanks very much to everyone

16
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,270
for saving me at all costs.

17
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,230
Grateful beyond words.

18
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,550
Additionally,

19
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,550
there are a few things I'd like to share with everyone.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
I am Feng Zihe.

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,790
Although

22
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,950
I don't know when I became Yu Zhao,

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,050
I remember clearly

24
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,900
that I am Feng Zihe.

25
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,300
My father was the head of the Golden Blade Sect,

26
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:38,290
Feng Lie, the Knife Master.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,970
And...

28
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,040
Huo is my younger brother.

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,800
His name is Feng Zihuan.

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,030
Black and Yellow Immortals

31
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,100
were my father's subordinates.

32
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,660
Feng Zihuan?

33
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,340
I didn't intend to lie to you, Yun.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,680
Feng Zihuan?

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,070
Feng Zihe?

36
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,310
Xixi,

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,310
that makes us sister-in-laws, right?

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,670
This has just added another layer of kinship between us.

39
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,740
What kind of logic is that?

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,570
From now on, everyone can just call me Huo.

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,890
Ruoyu.

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,840
I remember you now.

43
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,560
Zihe.

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,900
Thank you for your concern over these many years.

45
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,250
In the prison of Lu Ming Manor,

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,570
I've thought a lot

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,460
and understood a lot.

48
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,230
Only by facing the past

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
can one continue to move forward.

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,390
Now, I want to move forward.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,829
I want to marry Yu Xixi.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,980
In fact, I've been in love with you from the beginning.

53
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,390
It's just that, in the past,

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,620
I didn't know how to express it.

55
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,990
But now, I understand.

56
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,260
To love someone

57
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,990
means to give her more respect.

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,160
Whether I am Yu Zhao or Feng Zihe,

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
I will love you in this way.

60
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,900
Tomorrow,

61
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,480
I am officially marrying you.

62
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,330
Are you willing?

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,510
Manager Yu, since you have said so,

64
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
how could I not be willing?

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,250
Mrs. Yu will be happy for you

66
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,910
in the underworld.

67
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,490
This...

68
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,460
This place is rather shabby.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,070
I'm afraid it is not good enough for you two.

70
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,940
It's okay, Uncle San.

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,909
The formality is not important.

72
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,270
Young Master, rest assured.

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,920
Today, you and Miss

74
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,590
can go around nearby,

75
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,530
take a stroll,

76
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,760
have some fun.

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,560
The rest of us will be at home

78
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,170
preparing for tomorrow's wedding.

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,430
Okay.

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,910
Let's eat.

81
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,890
Yes, let's eat.

82
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,570
Try this, Yun.

83
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,020
This is a pigeon I specifically shot for you.

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,180
When did you shoot a pigeon?

85
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,250
Are there pigeons around here?

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,070
Why didn't I see any?

87
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,760
Last night, I couldn't sleep,

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,470
so I went out for a stroll.

89
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,880
Got two pigeons with one arrow.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,220
Pigeon?

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,450
Where?

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,270
This...

93
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,020
Forget it.

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,940
Let him eat it.

95
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:34,880
Never mind.

96
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,720
I can eat this.

97
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,040
This kid.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,930
Master.

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,370
The Mirror Commander has arrived.

100
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,159
Okay.

101
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,350
Where is him?

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,620
He is waiting for you in the lobby.

103
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,690
Okay.

104
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,530
Mirror Commander, I was unaware of your arrival,

105
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,590
and I apologize for not welcoming you from a distance.

106
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,270
Please forgive me, forgive me.

107
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,520
You still recognize me as the Mirror Commander?

108
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,620
Commander, why did you say that?

109
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,390
I've sent you 7 letters.

110
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,310
Why no response?

111
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,290
I've been overwhelmed with affairs

112
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,290
and truly couldn't find time to respond to your letters, Commander.

113
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,130
Overwhelmed with affairs?

114
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,590
What kind of affairs?

115
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,480
Tell me.

116
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,780
It's...

117
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,300
It's...

118
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,800
It is about Feng Zihe, isn't it?

119
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,159
Commander, you've already known?

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,680
Commander, I truly dare not conceal it.

121
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,500
It's just that...

122
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,250
How could you let him escape?

123
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,440
I told you to kill him immediately

124
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,670
to prevent future troubles.

125
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,560
But you insisted on creating a big scene with the Feng Slaughtering Conference.

126
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,100
Now what?

127
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,430
He has been rescued from Lu Ming Manor.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,040
You not only failed to stand out

129
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,940
but instead lost face.

130
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,560
Mirror Commander, you are right.

131
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,840
I acknowledge my mistake.

132
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,770
You losing face is a small matter.

133
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,850
If he recalls anything,

134
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,540
we won't be able to keep

135
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
what happened 13 years ago hidden.

136
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,790
If the martial world learns of this,

137
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,270
chaos will ensue.

138
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,520
If the higher-ups find out,

139
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,590
I'll be in trouble.

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
As for you,

141
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,670
the renowned Sword Master involved in such matters,

142
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,030
do you think the martial world will still accept you?

143
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,430
Mirror Commander, please rest assured.

144
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,830
I will definitely capture Feng Zihe

145
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,870
and ensure everything is trouble-free.

146
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,390
Where is Ruoyu?

147
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,480
Is she still with them?

148
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,470
Yes.

149
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,070
Ensure her safety.

150
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,270
Bring her back.

151
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,150
Yes.

152
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,710
Chief of Sects?

153
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,630
You!

154
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,830
How dare you lie to me,

155
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,260
claiming to be Huo.

156
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,610
I had no choice.

157
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,960
I was afraid you might be in danger.

158
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,870
So,

159
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,110
what should I call you now?

160
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,690
Young Master Feng?

161
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,030
Zihuan?

162
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,330
Huo.

163
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,230
Come over and help!

164
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,240
Coming, Uncle San.

165
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,120
Call me husband.

166
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,530
You little rascal!

167
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,280
What did you say?

168
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,950
Uncle San, get out of my way!

169
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,970
He was talking nonsense.

170
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,760
-Huo, what's wrong with you?
-Stop!

171
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,260
Why did you provoke our Yun again?

172
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,940
-Okay, enough.
-Stop!

173
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,580
Stop talking nonsense!

174
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,270
Stop chasing him. Get to work.

175
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,420
Miss Liu.

176
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,770
Miss Liu?

177
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,760
You're just too stubborn.

178
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,770
Whatever you want to say, say it.

179
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,550
If you want to cry, just let it out.

180
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,680
Mengniang,

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,890
I initially thought

182
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,350
I would be very sad.

183
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,650
But when Zihe said

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
he wanted to marry Yu Xixi,

185
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,840
I suddenly felt incredibly relieved.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Truly.

187
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,150
It was an

188
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,650
unprecedented sense of relief.

189
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,630
I think he was right.

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,890
I should look forward.

191
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,150
People change.

192
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,050
We've all grown up.

193
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,160
We're no longer

194
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,470
the innocent boy and girl we used to be.

195
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,530
Miss Liu,

196
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,350
I'm glad that you can think like this.

197
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,140
Exactly!

198
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,290
With your looks and talents,

199
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
there's no type of gentleman you can't find,

200
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,550
right?

201
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,930
Since I was a child,

202
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,140
I believed that all the admiration from others

203
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,200
doesn't compare to a single glance from Zihe.

204
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,350
Now, looking back,

205
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,950
I realized how foolish I was back then.

206
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,500
I, the proud Liu Ruoyu,

207
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,250
actually became that humble.

208
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,630
Mengniang,

209
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,030
don't worry about me.

210
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,220
Go help your Jin Gang.

211
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,880
Look at the way he gazes at you, so infatuated.

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll go then, Miss Liu.

213
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,400
Go.

214
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,080
Jin Gang, wait for me.

215
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,660
Young Master,

216
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,380
do you think everything you've done

217
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,350
for Yu Xixi is worth it?

218
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,670
Now she’s marrying someone else.

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,730
Is it worth betraying the Master for this?

220
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,950
What are your plans?

221
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,210
Are you just going to follow them, pass the days,

222
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,640
and lead a secluded life?

223
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,200
Young Master,

224
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,310
you are destined for greater things.

225
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,950
Greater things?

226
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,640
What greater things?

227
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,530
I've never thought about achieving something grand.

228
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,480
I just want to be an ordinary person,

229
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,020
having a loved one by my side,

230
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,450
getting married, having children,

231
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
dealing with the daily grind,

232
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,710
experiencing joys and sorrows.

233
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,110
I've never dreamed of becoming someone important.

234
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,320
It's just that my father...

235
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,740
Young Master.

236
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,620
Please don't say such things anymore.

237
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,020
You know what?

238
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,850
I actually envy you a lot.

239
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,030
No matter how hard I try,

240
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,130
I'm just a servant of Lu Ming Manor.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,250
No matter how high my martial arts skills are,

242
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,210
I can't practice

243
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,490
the 10th level of Lu Ming Sword Skill.

244
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,440
If only we could trade identities.

245
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,150
Everyone's fate

246
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,730
is predetermined.

247
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,070
We can't change it.

248
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,940
Young Master.

249
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,710
Once this matter is settled,

250
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,670
come back to the Manor with me

251
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,140
and apologize to the Master.

252
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,470
He will forgive you.

253
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm sure I can't go back.

254
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,100
I stabbed my father.

255
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,440
Lu Ming Manor...

256
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,890
I know him too well.

257
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,180
My father is vengeful.

258
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,130
He won't tolerate me.

259
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,000
I was smart all my life,

260
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,110
didn't expect it to end up in nothing.

261
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,500
By the way,

262
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,880
are you hiding something from me?

263
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,020
With our relationship, you must not lie to me.

264
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,990
Young Master, we've grown up together.

265
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,910
We are not brothers,

266
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,140
but we are like brothers.

267
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,070
I trust you.

268
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,030
Let's go.

269
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,270
We'll get married tomorrow.

270
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,870
After that,

271
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,560
what are your plans?

272
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
I haven't figured it out yet.

273
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,310
But...

274
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,010
after tomorrow, we'll be husband and wife.

275
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,990
We should share joys and sorrows,

276
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,310
face everything together.

277
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,670
Don't worry.

278
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,400
I've got your back from now on.

279
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,990
Keep your word.

280
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,900
I'll follow your lead from now on.

281
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,590
Okay.

282
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,260
You won't run away this time, will you?

283
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,510
No.

284
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,040
Anyway, no matter where I go,

285
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,560
you'll find me.

Uncle San.

315
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,690
What are you doing here acting mysteriously?

316
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,840
I've been cleaning

317
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,740
and waiting for you two to come back.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,640
I didn't expect you

319
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,210
to come back so late.

320
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,280
I was worried.

321
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,760
What made you come back so late

322
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,270
from the wilderness

323
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,910
at this hour?

324
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,410
Nothing.

325
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,440
Nothing.

326
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,250
Miss.

327
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,230
Miss, why is your face

328
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,430
so red?

329
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,280
Have you caught a cold?

330
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,600
Let me take a look.

331
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,110
No.

332
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,790
Uncle San.

333
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,550
If you have something to say, just say it.

334
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,560
We're all ears.

335
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,350
Tomorrow, you two will be married.

336
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,170
I have a few words of advice.

337
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,250
Okay.

338
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,630
Normally,

339
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,990
you shouldn't see each other today.

340
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,340
However,

341
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,880
considering the special circumstances,

342
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,170
we'll let it slide.

343
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,790
But tonight,

344
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,590
you two

345
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,550
must sleep in separate rooms.

346
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,580
Okay!

347
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:45,880
We definitely will.

348
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,510
Miss, as long as you understand.

349
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,160
Perfect.

350
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,750
I've already

351
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,280
tidied up the rooms.

352
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,080
The east wing is for Young Master,

353
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,310
and the west wing is for Miss.

354
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,890
Tomorrow morning,

355
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,109
Miss, you'll move from the west wing to the east wing,

356
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,710
as it's a formality.

357
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,990
Alright.

358
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,170
Rest early.

359
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,510
I'll go back to rest too.

360
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,430
Okay.

361
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,230
Uncle San?

362
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,590
Go back to your own rooms.

363
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,840
That way.

364
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,790
That way.

365
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,410
Yu Xixi!

366
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,310
Why are you here?

367
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,400
Why am I here?

368
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,260
What day is it today?

369
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,130
Why am I here?

370
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,360
Today?

371
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,390
It's your wedding.

372
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,190
You're still sleeping.

373
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,730
Hurry, get up, freshen up, and dress up.

374
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,080
I'll go find Yu Zhao.

375
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,420
Sit down!

376
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,610
Before the wedding,

377
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,680
the bride wants to see the groom?

378
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,480
Show a bit of restraint!

379
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,780
Well,

380
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,650
what should I wear today?

381
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,410
Just wait.

382
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,990
Is it pretty?

383
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,420
What is it?

384
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,730
The current wedding custom is the groom wears red and the bride wears green.

385
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,040
This is your wedding dress.

386
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,580
Yesterday, your best friend, I,

387
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,030
ran through several villages with Huo overnight

388
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,790
and borrowed it.

389
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,190
I personally picked it out.

390
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,370
You picked it out?

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
Got it. I like it.

392
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,600
You like it, right?

393
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,590
Hurry up and change into it.

394
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,360
I think I'll stick to my previous clothes.

395
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,750
I think getting married in my old clothes

396
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,330
is also fine.

397
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
How can that be allowed?

398
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,610
Although this wedding is relatively simple,

399
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,000
everything that should be there must be there.

400
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,760
I don't want to get married in this outfit.

401
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,610
Whether you want to or not,

402
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,590
you have to wear it.

403
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,710
No.

404
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,710
No?

405
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,430
You don't want to wear it?

406
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,510
You don't want to change into it?

407
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,150
Let me check you for Yu Zhao!

408
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,110
What are you doing here?

409
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,910
Miss asked me to deliver something.

410
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,710
What does Liu Ruoyu want to do?

411
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,210
What are you waiting for?

412
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,460
Come and give me a hand.

413
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,970
What's this? It's so heavy.

414
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,130
Brother, why are you laughing?

415
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,570
Nothing.

416
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,060
Who is it?

417
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,420
Zihe, it's me.

418
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,570
What is she here for?

419
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:13,950
Open the door.

420
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,710
Ruoyu, what do you mean?

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,890
Don't make any mistakes.

422
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,450
I came

423
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,920
to deliver your wedding dresses.

424
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,590
Since I was a child, I dreamed of marrying you.

425
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,470
So, I found the best tailor in the capital

426
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,810
and made a set of wedding dresses

427
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,470
for both the bride and groom.

428
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,180
It's just a dream that one day,

429
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,660
you and I can wear wedding dresses,

430
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,220
stand between heaven and earth,

431
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,760
become husband and wife,

432
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,350
and never be separated.

433
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,510
This time, I brought the wedding dress with me

434
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,850
on the way here

435
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,580
because I was determined to marry you

436
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,050
when I find you.

437
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,270
But now

438
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,520
it seems a bit ridiculous.

439
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:34,910
Actually,

440
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,520
I couldn't sleep all night last night

441
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,170
and thought a lot.

442
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,820
Even if I'm not the bride,

443
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,310
I still hope you can wear this wedding dress.

444
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,360
It can be considered fulfilling my wish.

445
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,790
As for the bride's dress,

446
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,020
I've already asked Mengniang to give it to Yu Xixi.

447
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,390
It feels so good

448
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,100
to say it out loud.

449
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,480
Zihe,

450
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,110
let me change you into the wedding dress.

451
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,510
It's okay, Ruoyu.

452
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,470
Jin Gang will help me change.

453
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,690
Yun, how do you think?

454
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,940
So beautiful.

455
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,840
Really?

456
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,530
Yes.

457
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,920
In a while, Yuzhao will definitely be unable to control himself.

458
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,030
He will be charmed to death by you.

459
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:15,390
So annoying.

460
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:15,990
It's about time.

461
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,780
Let's hurry over.

462
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,670
Don't miss the auspicious moment.

463
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,520
Hurry up.

464
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,380
Xixi, hurry up.

465
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,650
Can you move aside a bit?

466
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,360
Step over.

467
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,310
-You...
-Don't forget to take the Tuanshan.

468
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,690
Cover your face.

469
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,150
Are you ready?

470
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,600
Miss Liu.

471
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,550
You're welcome.

472
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,670
For Zihe's wedding,

473
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,690
I certainly have to ensure his dignity.

474
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,790
Don't be careless,

475
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,910
and mess up the wedding.

476
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,360
Okay.

477
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,350
Brother.

478
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,880
Young Master.

479
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,950
Miss.

480
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,160
Take three steps forward.

481
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,900
Uncle San.

482
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Am I acting as the father

483
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,270
or the mother?

484
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,950
I...

485
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,160
Fine.

486
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,350
I'll just play both roles,

487
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,630
and just stand here.

488
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,550
Jin Gang.

489
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,600
-Let’s start.
-Okay.

490
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
First bow to the heaven and earth,

491
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,850
Second bow to the ancestors,

492
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:57,680
♫People are having fun with fireworks and lanterns♫

493
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,320
Husband and wife bow to each other.

494
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:06,740
♫The heartbroken man is speechless in the cold spring breeze♫

495
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:15,010
♫They should have loved each other♫

496
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,980
Spread these in the eastern part of the curtain.

497
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,350
Light fills the tent, embroidered hibiscus blooms.

498
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,830
The bride is not clearly visible,

499
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,270
not knowing how beautiful she is.

500
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,890
♫But it seems to be an unrequited love♫

501
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,750
Spread these in the western part of the curtain.

502
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,370
Fragrant wind surrounds the ground, auspicious clouds descend.

503
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:26,610
♫Who is awake in the middle of the night?♫

504
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,530
Peach blossoms fly over the bank, with red rain.

505
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,910
Beginning to believe that the Peach Blossom Road is not lost.

506
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,910
Spread these in the southern part of the curtain.

507
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,120
Pearls and jade are in the Furong Lake.

508
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,950
A thousand flowers charmingly encircle the beauty.

509
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,520
Tonight, the Green Phoenix will try to experience the marriage.

510
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,190
Spread these in the northern part of the curtain.

511
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,360
Powdered makeup arrives for the first time, unrecognized by the people.

512
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,880
Red curtains, green surroundings, guarding the fragrant dust.

513
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:48,130
♫We dance all night♫

514
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,580
Smiling, lifting the fragrant cover, bowing to the jade mat.

515
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,470
Spread these in the center of the curtain.

516
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,840
Mandarin ducks pillow, sleeping soundly.

517
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
Musk continuously fills the golden ducks.

518
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:56,640
♫Midnight is the saddest time♫

519
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,470
Don't ask about the time.

520
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,550
♫All the splendor of life is gone in an instant♫

521
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,980
Since you've cut a strand of hair,

522
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,350
I'll cut one too.

523
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,570
♫But the flowing water doesn't understand my feeling♫

524
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,060
♫There is nowhere for me to express my miss♫

525
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,230
Searching for the place where,

526
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,500
Hand in hand, we weave a heart knot.

527
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,740
♫I wish you and me are like the moon and the star♫

528
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,140
One for each.

529
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,320
♫Which can dance together all night♫

530
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,760
On an auspicious day and a beautiful night, we share a cup of couple's wine.

531
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,750
♫I want to go back to when we were together♫

532
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,350
Orchid-like sentiments, hoping for a courtyard full of fragrance.

533
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:41,150
♫There's you, me, songs, and the moon♫

534
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,460
Okay.

535
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,480
Since you've already shared the couple's wine,

536
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,270
both of you are to share joys and sorrows,

537
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,390
♫How much I want to have the spring♫

538
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,870
until death do you part.

539
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,030
-Good!
-All right.

540
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,750
Let's all go out and celebrate with wedding wine.

541
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,060
Let's drink until we're intoxicated.

542
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,710
Let's go.

543
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,980
Aren't we supposed to mess up the bride and the groom?

544
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,530
You little rascal! Hurry up and leave!

545
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,230
Let's go.

546
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,620
Brother.

547
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,430
Honey.

548
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,820
Honey, we...

549
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:27,510
Okay.

550
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,960
The...
