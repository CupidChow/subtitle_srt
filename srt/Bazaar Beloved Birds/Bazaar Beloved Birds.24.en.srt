[Episode 24]

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,910
Here's your sweet water.

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,830
Try it.

6
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
There is no such thing in the capital.

7
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,470
How is it? Is it delicious?

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,760
Good.

9
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,880
To make the sweet water,

10
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,400
the first step is to get some pine sugar, spring water, ageratum leaves,

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,510
spikenard and ginger, and cook them in proportion.

12
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,190
Then, strain out the soup,

13
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,450
and add some musk, mung beans and white sandalwood powder.

14
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,780
Finally,

15
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,180
ice the soup. It tastes amazing.

16
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,130
I didn't expect

17
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,079
the Young Master of the Lu Ming Manor

18
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,360
to know these.

19
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,540
I know all beer and skittles.

20
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,540
You're right.

21
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,240
That's why your father

22
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,400
dislikes you.

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,630
Whatever.

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,610
-I... -Do you know who convened the Martial Arts Competition?

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
Ye Yunqing.

26
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,040
Who else could it be?

27
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,940
After all, he's the Chief of Sects.

28
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,060
Your chief didn't tell you the truth?

29
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,190
He left in a hurry after receiving the Summon Order.

30
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,350
Listen.

31
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,290
Feng Zihe convened the Competition.

32
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,670
Feng Zihe?

33
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,200
The assembly will be held at the Golden Blade Sect.

34
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,950
Most of the chiefs went there

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,470
with top masters of their sects.

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,510
What do you think

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,980
they are going to do?

38
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,110
I'm afraid

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,390
there will be a bloody fight.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,910
So,

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,280
let's enjoy ourselves.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,510
The world will be in chaos again.

43
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,630
Let's have fun in time.

44
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,750
You're right. Have fun in time.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,490
Well, do you know

46
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,270
why did Zihe hold the Martial Arts Competition?

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't know.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,590
But he must

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,780
have his own purpose.

50
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,190
How about

51
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,430
not going back to the capital?

52
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,630
What?

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,930
Let's go to the Golden Blade Sect.

54
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,220
But

55
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,900
it might be dangerous there.

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,190
It's okay. I'm not afraid of danger.

57
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,990
Besides,

58
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,870
you promised to protect me.

59
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,350
Are you determined to go there?

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,670
Fine.

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,790
It's not far from the Golden Blade Sect.

62
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,330
Let's keep flying.

63
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,570
OK.

Welcome, Mirror Commander.

66
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,340
Then,

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,690
I'll leave it to you

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,700
and take my leave.

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,730
Wait.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,140
I think we should make it clear.

71
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,550
My lord,

72
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,540
what do you mean?

73
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,810
I'm referring to the fact that you betrayed the martial arts world

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,150
and killed a lot of masters of different sects.

75
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,490
What?

76
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,970
What do you mean?

77
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,080
Everyone,

78
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,600
he is the one who schemed

79
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,760
what happened 13 years ago.

80
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,230
He forced the Laugh Master to create the poisonous insect,

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,320
and tricked Feng Zihe into taking it.

82
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,350
After Feng Zihe became the Demon Boy, his power increased

83
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,110
but he went crazy.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
However, since Zihe remained his humanity,

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,659
he only hurt people but did not kill them.

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,640
Ye Yunqing

87
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,380
didn't satisfy with the result.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,340
To achieve his goal,

89
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,690
he hired someone to impersonate the Demon Boy and killed many people.

90
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,460
Then he tried to kill the killer.

91
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,270
Don't you want your daughter to live?

92
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,420
After you die,

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,320
I will take her myself.

No need.

97

You let me help you kill the disciples of all sects.

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,950
Maybe

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
I misunderstood.

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,150
Heroes,

103
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,600
I think you know

Do it.

Everyone, enter the hall.

118
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,130
I'll find someone to open the door.

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,430
Mr. Chen will take you out of here.

120
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,350
What about you?

121
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,470
I have to ensure everyone's safety.

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
I know what you want to do.

123
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,430
I won't let you go.

124
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,880
Yu Xixi!

125
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,710
Look at them.

126
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,179
Do as what I say.

127
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,470
Live well.

128
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,990
Do you remember?

129
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,350
Mr. Chen.

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,270
No.

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,690
Yu Zhao.

132
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,880
Huo,

133
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,360
find a chance to take Li Yun away.

134
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,470
No!

135
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,370
You're my brother.

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,450
You shall take the responsibility to revive the Golden Blade Sect if I die.

137
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,510
Zihe!

138
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,430
Everyone,

139
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,920
the truth

140
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,510
has been revealed,

141
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,420
but it's all because of me.

142
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,520
So I have the responsibility to get you out.

143
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,630
Mr. Feng,

144
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,710
tell us,

145
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,790
what do you want to do.

146
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,510
Demon Boy.

147
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,270
If I go mad and lost control,

148
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,510
my power will increase significantly.

149
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,030
Then, I can withstand the attack of the Mirror Department.

150
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,030
By then, you can break through the chaos.

151
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,750
Whether you can survive

152
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,070
depends on your fate.

153
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,270
What about you?

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,330
The tragedy began as I became the Demon Boy,

155
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,150
now it will end as I will become the Demon Boy again.

156
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,670
It is a satisfactory ending.

157
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,150
Once I go mad, I'll lose control.

158
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,950
Stay away from me.

159
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,630
Ye Mo,

160
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,030

Chenxing,

168
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,720
come with me.

169
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,310
I have gathered three pieces of Red Jade of Cangqiong.

170
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,870
I've been waiting for this moment

171
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,290
for so long time.

172
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,180
As long as I get the treasure,

173
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,360
I'll regain my power soon.

174
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,230
Let's go.

175
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,370
I've made up my mind.

176
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,630
I won't go with you.

177
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,790
Mo!

178
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,360
Are you leaving too?

179
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,830
Young Master,

180
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,780
we grew up together.

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,170
I've treated you as my brother.

182
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,010
I didn't expect that we would end up like this.

183
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,040
Young Master,

184
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,270
I have to go.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,630
Young Master,

186
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,770
please take care.

187
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,450
Thank you for saving us today, Young Master Feng.

188
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,980
Never mind.

189
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,520
I didn't expect that

190
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,570
Ye Yunqing has tricked us for so many years,

191
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,690
and we let them run away in the end.

192
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,730
Yes.

193
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,800
This is a hidden danger.

194
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,630
Look.

195
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,630
They have ruined the martial arts world.

196
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,190
We can't let them go.

197

Yes.

198

Everyone,

199
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,050
it's better to make friends than make enemies.

200
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,150
And you need to rest.

201
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,910
Okay, we'll obey your words.

202
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,220
But the martial arts world should have a leader.

203
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,320
In my opinion,

204
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,140
Young Master Feng, you should be the Chief of Sects.

205
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,920
Thank you for your kindness.

206
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,720
But I am just a merchant.

207
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,340
Besides,

208
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,090
I just want to spend the rest of my life with Xixi.

209
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,230
Fine.

210
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,230
Let's talk about it later.

211
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,930
Why do you have the antidote?

212
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,740
Do you remember my father's posthumous work in the secret room?

213
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,140
I secretly brought it out.

214
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
In the Whirlwind Stronghold,

215
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,550
I not only broke the mechanical ball,

216
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,750
but also developed

217
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,510
the antidote to the poison in your body.

218
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,680
Give me the jade.

219
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,460
What is

220
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,280
the secret of the treasure?

221

replaced his brother,

232
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,030
and took over the Golden Blade Sect.

is different from what he imagined.

235

not bad.

But when he heard that Miss Liu came to see him,

254
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,870
he was still flustered.
