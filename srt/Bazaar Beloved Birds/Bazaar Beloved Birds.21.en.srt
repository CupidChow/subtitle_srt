There are

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,190
so many dead poisonous insects.

One hundred grams of Scorpion Grass.

Add them to the soup

20

and feed the poisonous insects with the soup.

21
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,790
Then this poison is formed.

22
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,180
The incense is the trigger of the efficacy

in a poison-making book.

27
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,920
This is a prescription for poison production.

With our current situation,

of the Laugh Master is not here,

110
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,110
then where else could it be?

111
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,990
Yu Mansion?

112
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,090
Yu Mansion.

113
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,550
There must be something we don't know.

114
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,070
Don't tell anyone about this.

115
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,430
Yes.

116
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,430
It seems that my father didn't find

117
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,710
Yu Zhao and Xixi.

118
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,430
But Jin Gang was arrested.

119
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,440
I wonder

120
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,470
how Zihe is now.

121
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,240
Don't worry.

122
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,380
Judging from how angry my father is,

123
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,840
I guess they are fine.

124
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,020
I hope so.

125
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,160
It's getting late.

126
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,990
Miss Liu, you shall rest early.

127
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,820
I really don't know

128
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,680
why your father locked us up.

129
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,380
I know him

130
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,030
very well.

131
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,150
After stabbing him,

132
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,510
he has stopped

133
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
seeing me as his son.

134
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,770
He only cares about

135
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,230
his career.

136
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,550
And I am

137
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,480
just a prisoner of his.

138
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,110
But what I'm worried about now

139
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,490
is that you might have become a prisoner of his.

140
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,940
From the beginning,

141
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,700
my father probably didn't want you

142
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,890
to go back to Mirror Commander.

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,740
Because in his eyes,

144
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,820
Mirror Commander was just a pawn.

145
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,900
He could control him

146
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,450
by controlling you.

147
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,120
Well...

148
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,750
But don't worry, Miss Liu.

149
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,310
I am always by your side.

150
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,630
I will protect you.

151
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,150
Protect me?

152
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,760
Yes.

153
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,170
It's getting late.

154
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,570
Miss Liu, you shall rest early.

155
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,930
I'll sit here.

156
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,450
Come in. No one is inside.

157
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,290
Brother, I checked. No one is here.

158
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,390
How did you know

159
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,570
they wouldn't wait for us in the cellar?

160
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,430
Ye Yunqing would never expect

161
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,410
we would come back.

162
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,550
So it's safer here.

163
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,910
I need to go out.

164
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,470
Get out?

165
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,990
I need to go and save Jin Gang and Uncle San.

166
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,790
Yu Zhao, are you crazy?

167
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,830
It's heavily guarded outside.

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,600
If you go out now, you can't save anyone.

169
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,700
On the contrary, you'll put yourself in danger.

170
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,830
I need to know

171
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,270
if they are still alive.

172
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,470
But...

173
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,590
I have something important to ask Uncle San.

174
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,560
Why is there a secret chamber belonging to the Laugh Master here?

175
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,890
What does he have to do

176
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,400
with me being demonic when I was young?

177
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,320
Probably only Uncle San knows the answers.

178
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,840
Alright.

179
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,670
I'll go with you.

180
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,330
Me too.

181
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,780
No.

182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,480
It's more convenient for me to be alone.

183
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,350
This is

184
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,390
a mechanical crossbow I made.

185
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,670
There are six arrows on it.

186
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,030
Press here

187
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,930
and you'll shoot an arrow.

188
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,110
Press this button

189
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,150
and you'll shoot an arrow with a special chain.

190
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,750
Press it again and it will be withdrawn.

191
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
It can help you escape.

192
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,400
You must wear it.

193
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Huo, stay here and take care of them.

194
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,750
Okay.

195
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,180
Let's check it.

196
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,190
Uncle San.

197
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,950
Uncle San.

198
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,060
Young Master.

199
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,890
Why are you back?

200
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm here to get you out.

201
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,790
Leave now.

202
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,120
Look at my injury.

203
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,030
I can't leave.

204
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,660
Jin Gang's injuries are worse than mine.

205
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,530
If I hadn't hit his acupoints,

206
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,020
he wouldn't have survived.

207
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,620
Leave now.

208
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,950
Take Miss Xixi out of here.

209
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,950
What about you?

210
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,490
Leave us alone.

211
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,390
Don't worry.

212
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,830
We won't be in danger.

213
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,630
Ye Yunqing won't kill us.

214
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,770
He still needs us to threaten you.

215
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,250
Leave now.

216
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,450
Uncle San.

217
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,900
I have a question for you.

218
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,030
Young Master, please go ahead.

219
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,020
What's your relationship

220
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,350
with the Laugh Master, Hai Liyuan?

221
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,950
You are the Vice Master of Yixiao Hall, Cheng Wen,

222
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,230
and the sworn brother with the Laugh Master?

223
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,790
Yes.

224
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,109
Bai Linglong is my wife.

225
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,400
In order to hide our identities,

226
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,710
she disguised herself as Zang Muxiang,

227
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,440
and I used an assumed name of Uncle San.

228
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,910
I became her servant

229
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,260
rather than her husband.

230
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,450
What about Yu Xixi?

231
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,070
Yu Xixi

232
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,620
is the daughter of the Laugh Master, Hai Liyuan.

233
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,950
Yu Xixi is the daughter of Hai Liyuan?

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
Yes.

235
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,510
Thirteen years ago,

236
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,390
the Laugh Master saved you from the Golden Blade Sect.

237
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,840
That year, you were 12

238
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,950
while Xixi was 6.

239
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,070
Have Cheng Wen and Bai Linglong arrived?

240
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,550
They've been waiting in the lobby for a long time.

241
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,550
Take the kid in first.

242
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,330
I'll be there soon.

243
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,810
Yes.

244
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,660
Who is this kid?

245
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,780
He's badly injured.

246
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,570
His meridians are in disorder.

247
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,550
Brother. Mrs. Hai.

248
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,760
Brother. Mrs. Cheng.

249
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,570
I called you here tonight

250
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,850
because I have a request.

251
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
Just tell me.

252
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,430
This is Chief Feng Lie's eldest son,

253
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,160
Feng Zihe.

254
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,590
Something happened at the Golden Blade Sect tonight.

255
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,520
I saved Feng Zihe tonight.

256
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,850
I want to leave him to you.

257
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,670
Leave...

258
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,930
Leave him to us?

259
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,800
I will also leave my daughter to you.

260
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,630
Mr. Hai, what happened?

261
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,100
Ask no more.

262
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,230
Take them to a place where no one knows them

263
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
and live a good life

264
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,660
with a concealed identity.

265
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,910
I've sealed

266
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,030
all their memories with point striking.

267
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,680
They won't remember what happened.

268
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,550
Don't let them enter the martial arts world again.

269
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,510
Please.

270
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,470
I discussed with Linglong.

271
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,140
If our names should be changed,

272
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,610
we might as well

273
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,650
alter all our identities completely.

274
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,680
Linglong was good at medicine,

275
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,000
especially facial reshaping.

276
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,750
So the two of us

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,270
reshaped our faces

278
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,930
and settled down in Xianyun City.

279
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,310
We built Huixian Restaurant

280
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,280
with the money left by Brother Hai.

281
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,520
You know

282
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,500
what happened later.

283
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,620
Yixiao Hall was slaughtered

284
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,180
because of this?

285
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,710
I didn't know.

286
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,650
The day after Yixiao Hall was slaughtered,

287
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
I went back to check secretly.

288
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,350
All the corpses at the scene

289
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,390
were from Yixiao Hall.

290
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,510
Obviously,

291
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,710
someone tampered with them.

292
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,930
And the wounds of the bodies

293
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,730
were all caused by the Yanling Sword.

294
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,930
The Yanling Sword?

295
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,460
Isn't that the sword used in the army?

296
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,800
Yes.

297
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,940
So it was very strange.

298
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,320
Looking back,

299
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,620
I thought Brother Hai

300
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,560
knew something.

301
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,430
Uncle San.

302
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,980
Did Hai Liyuan have anything to do with me being demonic?

303
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,060
What do you mean?

304
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,070
We found the secret room of Hai Liyuan.

305
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,840
There were some strange things written in it.

306
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,350
The secret room?

307
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,320
To be honest,

308
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,630
I didn't know there was a secret room

309
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,230
in the basement

310
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
until today.

311
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,130
I only knew that Brother Hai

312
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,420
came to this courtyard regularly

313
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,600
and locked himself in the room on the east all day long.

314
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,760
What about the the Red Jade of Cangqiong of Hai Liyuan?

315
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,070
Let's see if that old man is dead.

316
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,430
Young Master, you must leave now

317
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,820
before it's too late.

318
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,400
Hurry!

319
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,090
Young Master.

320
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,760
Brother.

321
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,460
How are they?

322
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,680
How are Uncle San and Jin Gang?

323
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,920
They're all alive.

324
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,700
Did you ask everything?

325
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,220
I'm tired. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

326
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,380
Okay.

327
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,230
Yu Xixi

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,760
is the daughter the Laugh Master, Hai Liyuan.
