[Episode 22]

4
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,840
Leave this Uncle San to me.

5
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,610
Kill

6
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,020
the other one.

7
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,510
Yes, sir!

8
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,770
You can't kill Jin Gang!

9
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,010
Jin Gang!

10
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,190
Jin Gang!

11
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,480
Jin Gang!

12
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,030
Jin Gang!

13
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,840
Jin Gang!

14
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,880
Jin Gang!

15
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,180
He's still breathing.

16
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,790
-Jin Gang, wake up!
-He's breathing.

17
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,980
Young Master.

18
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,090
It's Ye Mo.

19
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,310
Ye Mo?

20
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,860
Ye Mo saved me.

21
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,290
Ye Mo saved you?

22
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,820
What should we do now?

23
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,600
They haven't gone far.

24
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,210
Let's get out of here through the tunnel in the secret room.

25
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,540
-Okay. 
-Okay.

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
-Let's go.  
-Let's go.

27
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,710
Be careful.

28
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,370
Over there.

29
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,950
Be careful.

30
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,540
Huo.

31
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,430
Take them to the east later.

32
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,440
Uncle San told me

33
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,350
there was a dock over there.

34
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,220
Find a boat owner named Ruan

35
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,840
to give you a ride.

36
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,460
What about you?

37
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,490
I have something to do.

38
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,730
Yu Zhao.

39
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,630
Where are you going?

40
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,780
Aren't you coming with us?

41
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,640
Tell me. Where are you going?

42
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Xianyun City.

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
We just escaped from death. Why do you want to come back?

44
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,030
What happened?

45
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,240
Please don't ask.

46
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,550
I'll go to you when I'm done.

47
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,950
Don't lie to me.

48
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,670
Can you come back safely if you go back?

49
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,880
What is going on?

50
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,840
If you don't tell me,

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,870
I'll follow you wherever you go.

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,430
Uncle San told me a story.

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,340
What story?

54
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,080
Do you really want to know?

55
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,560
Uncle San's real name is Cheng Wen.

56
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,370
My mom's real name is Bai Linglong.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,990
They were husband and wife.

58
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,250
They were sworn brothers with the Laugh Master, Hai Liyuan.

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,310
Wait.

60
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm a bit confused.

61
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,730
And you are the daughter

62
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,270
of the Laugh Master, Hai Liyuan.

63
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,690
Xixi is the daughter of Hai Liyuan?

64
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,570
I'm the daughter of Hai Liyuan?

65
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,480
This mechanical ball

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,980
is exactly the same as mine.

67
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,050
[Laugh]

68
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,090
Xixi, you know,

69
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,100
jianghu is complicated and people are sinister.

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
I don't want you to get hurt.

71
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,210
But the slaughter of the Golden Blade Sect and Yixiao Hall

72
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,960
is not that simple.

73
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,110
Besides,

74
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,950
the truth of my being demonic is still unfound.

75
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,230
So I have to investigate it.

76
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,830
After all, it was started by me.

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,670
I have to end this, too.

78
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,190
I'll go with you.

79
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,710
We're married.

80
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,030
We're a family.

81
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,550
We have to face everything together.

82
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,430
Besides,

83
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,310
it's not all your fault.

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,780
Since the Laugh Master is my father,

85
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,580
I need to figure this out.

86
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,130
I'll always be on your side.

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,870
Nothing can separate us.

88
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,620
We're going too.

89
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,400
Yes.

90
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,690
Let's set off.

91
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,530
Xianyun City is far.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,630
Master.

93
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,300
We're at the fork road.

94
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,110
Stop here.

95
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,730
Send Young Master and Miss Liu back to Lu Ming Manor.

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,340
Let's go to Xianyun City.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,110
Yes.

98
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
What's going on?

99
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,360
That's the direction of Xianyun City.

100
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,820
Xianyun City?

101
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,980
Maybe he already knew that Feng Zihe

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
would return to the Yu Mansion.

103
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,600
So they want to wait for him in advance.

104
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,990
What should we do?

105
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,110
We have to tell Zihe.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,520
Who can we save now?

107
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,940
We can only pray for them.

108
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,710
You're right.

109
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,050
Look at you.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,010
If you practiced martial arts hard when you were young,

111
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,560
we wouldn't have been trapped in this carriage.

112
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,520
Am I wrong?

113
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,130
Both your father and Ye Mo left

114
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,880
because they think

115
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,250
you are unable to escape.

116
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,159
You have no idea.

117
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,960
The people my father brought here today

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,730
are top masters of Lu Ming Manor.

119
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,520
Top masters?

120
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,580
It's unnecessary to

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,140
use top masters to get us.

122
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,320
How could you say that?

123
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,270
I'm the young master of Lu Ming Manor, okay?

124
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,940
Young Master?

125
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,830
Ask them

126
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,990
if they know you are the young master.

127
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,170
Go ahead.

128
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,020
Your young master asked you to stop.

129
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,810
Did anyone hear me?

130
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,810
You see?

131
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,270
Master Ye.

132
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,090
Mirror Commander wants to see you.

133
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,060
Ask Ye Mo to come here.

134
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,830
Yes, sir.

135
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,950
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

136
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,480
What can I do for you?

137
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,570
Where is Ruoyu?

138
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,960
Miss Liu is...

139
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,270
I'm looking for her.

140
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,680
My men saw it.

141
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,210
They saw your men

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,310
drove three carriages

143
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,160
to Lu Ming Manor

144
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,030
at a fork road 30 kilometers outside the city.

145
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,520
There's nothing I can hide from you.

146
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
Indeed.

147
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,630
To ensure Miss Liu's safety,

148
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,550
I've decided

149
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,980
to keep Miss Liu in the Lu Ming Manor.

150
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,430
I knew

151
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,190
what you think.

152
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,470
You just want to threaten me with Ruoyu.

153
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,050
Who do you think you are?

154
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,170
How can you threaten me?

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,750
If I hadn't concealed

156
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,350
your betrayal of jianghu back then,

157
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
everyone would have known about it.

158
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Remember,

159
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,390
you'll always be my dog.

160
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,160
A dog that can be abandoned at any time.

161
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,230
If you dare lay a finger on Ruoyu,

162
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,100
I will

163
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,610
destroy your Lu Ming Manor.

164
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,820
I dare not.

165
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,590
Solve the Demon Boy as soon as possible.

166
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:04,820
Let's go.

167
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,590
Master.

168
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,780
Are you alright?

169
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,730
I'm fine.

170
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,630
Get the last piece of red jade

171
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,550
as soon as possible.

172
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,830
Everything

173
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,690
will be solved.

174
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,310
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,350
Qian?

176
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,690
Manager Yu.

177
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,050
Miss Xixi.

178
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,610
Please come in.

179
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,050
Let Jin Gang rest inside.

180
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,620
Young Master. Miss Xixi.

181
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,880
Why are you back?

182
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,320
Looks like you knew about the Yu family.

183
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,090
The Yu Mansion is being watched closely.

184
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,260
I heard that you and Miss Xixi were missing.

185
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,840
I was so worried.

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm relieved to see you today.

187
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,950
Qian, is it safe here?

188
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,390
Don't worry.

189
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,110
Everyone in this inn is our men.

190
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,700
Jin Gang is badly injured.

191
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,940
He might stay here for a few more days.

192
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,500
How did he get hurt?

193
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,190
It's a long story.

194
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,500
By the way, my wife knows some medical skills.

195
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,530
I'll call her over.

196
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,120
Also, I'll ask them to prepare some food and liquor.

197
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,750
Have a rest, please.

198
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,700
Thank you.

199
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,940
Yu Zhao.

200
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,910
You said I am the daughter of Hai Liyuan,

201
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,810
and you are Feng Lie's son.

202
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,470
But why were we all in the Yu Family?

203
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,790
What happened 13 years ago?

204
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,440
Uncle San didn't know neither.

205
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,470
But he told me

206
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,490
the mechanical ball you often play with

207
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,420
was left by Hai Liyuan.

208
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,350
I guess the truth might be in it.

209
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,280
So I have to go back to Yu Mansion.

210
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,940
Zihe, I'll go with you.

211
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,630
Do will I.

212
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,120
Just stay here.

213
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,230
Huo is good at kung fu.

214
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,150
I'll be safe with him.

215
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,330
[Yu Mansion]

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,370
Wait here.

217
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,220
I'll go in alone.

218
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,030
Let's go inside together.

219
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,770
We can take care of each other.

220
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,850
I'd better enter alone.

221
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,570
If anything happens,

222
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,430
don't worry about me.

223
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,030
Go back to Qian's.

224
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,410
Take Yu Xixi and Li Yun out of the city.

225
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,310
Zihe.

226
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,150
Be thoughtful.

227
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,300
Who is it?

228
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,750
Come out!

229
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,130
Xiang.

230
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,150
Young...

231
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,300
Young Master, why are you back?

232
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,480
Where are the others?

233
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,790
Uncle San dismissed them

234
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,220
when he left.

235
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,820
I was left here to watch the mansion.

236
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,430
Now the Yu Mansion

237
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,440
has been surrounded by the people of Lu Ming Manor.

238
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,520
Young Master, please leave now.

239
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,270
It's too late.

240
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,310
What should we do?

241
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,630
Are the fireworks I prepared for Xixi

242
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,970
still in the warehouse?

243
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,790
Yes.

244
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,500
What's the use of them?

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,590
Wait for me at the door of the warehouse.

246
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,810
I'll get the carriage from the backyard.

247
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,600
Young Master. Miss Liu.

248
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,720
Rest early.

249
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,900
Rest early.

250
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
It's not the first time we've been like this.

251
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,830
What do you mean?

252
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,950
I mean

253
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,620
we were locked up

254
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,760
in the same room

255
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
of the lake house before.

256
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,450
What a fate.

257
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,600
I came out for Zihe.

258
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,560
But I was locked up with you again and again.

259
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,980
And now I am forced to marry you.

260
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,180
How pathetic and ridiculous!

261
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,110
It would be nice

262
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,180
if I  could fly out with my wings.

263
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,599
Wings?

264
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,640
Ye Chenxing!

265
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,619
What are you going to do?

266
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:16,980
No, I was about to...

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,730
Calm down. Control yourself.

268
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,760
Calm yourself down.

269
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,760
-I...
-Ye Chenxing.

270
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,680
I respect you for being a gentleman.

271
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,990
You can't act recklessly.

272
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,540
The walls have ears.

273
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,530
Miss Yu, something bad happened!

274
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,490
What's happened?

275
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,340
When I was about to check the situation,

276
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,010
I found lots of soldiers entering the city.

277
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,270
I think there must be something wrong.

278
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,520
Soldiers?

279
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,390
Oh no! Huo and Zihe are in danger!

280
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,860
We have to save them.

281
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,830
Let's go.

282
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,520
Let's go.

283
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,350
Open the door!

284
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,030
Open the door!

285
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,770
Miss Yu, I'll stall them.

286
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,340
Leave through the back door.

287
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,140
If we leave now,

288
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,590
what about Jin Gang and Mengniang?

289
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,700
I'll stay with Jin Gang.

290
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,770
They think Jin Gang is dead,

291
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,460
so they won't do anything to me.

292
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,770
It's fine.

293
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,850
I have an idea.

294
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,390
Take care.

295
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,480
Open the door.

296
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,030
Coming!

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Don't worry about me if anything happens inside.

298
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,700
Return to Qian's immediately

299
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,980
and take Yu Xixi and Li Yun out of the city.

300
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,050
Here we are again.

301
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,890
You were the masked man,

302
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,510
weren't you?

303
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,440
It was me.

304
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,690
Okay, let's compete again.

305
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,520
Sure.

306
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,150
Let's go.

307
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Guards!

308
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's go back!

309
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,320
Don't move.

310
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:57,920
Young Master Feng.

311
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,710
We meet again.

312
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,290
Young Master Feng,

313
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,700
you worried about Yu Xixi.

314
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,050
But it doesn't matter.

315
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,660
As long as you come with me,

316
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,260
I'll let you two meet.

317
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,220
Step aside.

318
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,900
You also hid something

319
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,300
from Yu Xixi, didn't you?

320
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,210
You're here

321
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,590
for Laugh Master's Red Jade of Cangqiong, right?

322
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,380
Give it to me.

323
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,560
If you do, I'll let you leave.

324
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,380
I don't know what you're talking about. Get out of the way!

325
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,140
Get him!

326
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,010
-Yes, sir. 
-Yes, sir.

327
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
Master Ye.

328
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,490
Long time no see.

329
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,720
Who is it?

330
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,710
It's you.

331
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,550
You're not dead?

332
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,590
I said I would save you.

333
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,600
Then I have to do it.

334
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,390
I never break my promise.

335
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,500
Take him down!

336
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,570
The rest of you, take Yu Zhao down!

337
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,360
Yes, sir.

338
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,420
I'm coming to help!

339
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,430
Mr. Yu, hurry to leave!

340
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,990
Thank you.

341
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,300
Yu Zhao, hurry up.

342
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,090
Hya!

343
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:37,860
Go after him!

344
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,170
Hya!

345
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,250
Xixi!

346
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,600
Move!

347
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,620
Hya!

348
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,270
Huo, get on the horse.

349
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,860
Go after them!

350
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,800
Ye Chenxing!

351
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,330
What's wrong?

352
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,570
According to your plan,

353
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,040
can we escape?

354
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,450
Don't worry.

355
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
My plan will be fine.

356
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,590
What we need to do now

357
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,170
is to wait patiently.

358
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,900
But what can we do

359
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,510
when we get out of here?

360
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,770
Well...

361
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm going to find Zihe.

362
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,490
I understand.

363
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,250
But

364
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,190
even if I escape from here,

365
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,690
in a few days,

366
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,490
my father will get me back.

367
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,840
If I escape again,

368
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,610
he will lock me up again.

369
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,890
It will be endless.

370
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,170
Why don't we be together?

371
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,320
Be together?

372
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,290
I mean

373
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,160
let's go save Zihe together.

374
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,140
After confirming their safety,

375
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,160
you can come back to the capital city with me.

376
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,410
I don't believe

377
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,290
your father dares to catch you at the Mirror Department.

378
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,130
Compared to you,

379
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,460
I feel ashamed.

380
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,120
You can pursue true love without hesitation.

381
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,710
You can also resist your father.

382
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,620
I dare not do these.

383
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,640
But

384
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,430
you stabbed your father before.

385
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,260
Who else could do that?

386
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,900
You have a point.

387
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,070
Look over there.

388
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,080
You know how to play hand shadow?

389
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,280
When I was young, Ye Mo

390
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,690
was my only friend.

391
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,970
But he had to practice swordsmanship hard.

392
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,810
So I could only play with myself.

393
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,850
Every night,

394
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,540
I used hand shadow

395
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,750
to tell myself stories.
