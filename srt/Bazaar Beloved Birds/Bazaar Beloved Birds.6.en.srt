11
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,950
Yes.

12
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,270
They are so fierce.

13
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,030
So scary.

Are they

sent by Yu Zhao to guard against Ye Chenxing?

16
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,170
Probably.

I just heard a piece of big news.

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,170
It's just past seven.

196
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,990
Let's go to see Yu Xixi.

197
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,600
Okay.

198
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
Young Master.

199
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,030
Miss Liu is here.

200
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,400
Why is she here again?

201
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,730
Young Master, we...

202
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,510
You

203
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,290
send her away first.

204
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,190
Yes.

205
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,490
Ye Chenxing! Ye Chenxing! Ye Chenxing!

206
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,590
Ye Chenxing! Ye Chenxing! Ye Chenxing!

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,130
What kind of dream is this?

208
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,870
Why did I dream of him?

209
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,530
I must be possessed.

210
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,020
What is it?

211
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,850
[I'm waiting for you! Yu Xixi.]

212
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,200
Ye Chenxing.

213
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Let's go.

214
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,530
Go.

215
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,270
Yu Xixi.

216
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,470
Hurry up.

217
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,740
Hurry.

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Why are you two here?

219
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
This morning,

220
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,540
Liu Ruoyu went to Huixian Restaurant to find me.

221
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,350
Liu Ruoyu?

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,550
Someone is coming.

223
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,230
Why are there two burlap bags

224
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,660
at the door of Miss's room?

225
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,290
She likes strange things.

226
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,830
It's normal.

227
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,480
You're right.

228
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,350
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

229
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,110
Let's go.

230
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,130
Let's go.

231
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,850
That was close.

232
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,390
What were we saying?

233
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,390
Liu Ruoyu was going to see you.

234
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,710
That's right.

235
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,630
She said she wanted to help you sneak out of Yu Mansion.

236
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,610
When did Liu Ruoyu become so kind?

237
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
I guess

238
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,910
she thinks that no one will compete with her for Yu Zhao anymore

239
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,910
if you go to Ye Chenxing.

240
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,750
Yes.

241
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,620
Liu Ruoyu.

242
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,090
Just tell me if you want to sneak out now or not.

243
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes.

244
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,950
Of course.

245
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,190
This matter

246
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,180
seems to have reached an urgent level

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,690
that can't be delayed.

248
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,120
Tell me.

249
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,170
What plan?

250
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,290
We have made

251
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,800
a very thorough plan.

252
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,940
Xiang will wear your clothes and pretend to be you.

253
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,210
I will drive the carriage to pick you up at the door.

254
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,950
Yes.

255
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,770
What about Yu Zhao?

256
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,650
Liu Ruoyu said

257
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,590
that she would take responsibility for that.

258
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,190
She?

259
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,370
It's fine.

260
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,390
I've calculated.

261
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,550
If everything goes well,

262
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,510
you can go back to the room in two hours.

263
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,280
Just pretend nothing has happened.

264
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,030
By the way, Miss,

265
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,110
I'll go in with you.

266
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,040
You'll change into this suit

267
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,510
and I'll put on your clothes.

268
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,030
Then you just wait for the signal.

269
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,170
Okay.

270
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Xixi.

271
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,110
A sense of ritual.

272
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,300
Hurry.

273
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,710
Let's do it.

274
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,360
You brought so many people here today to...

275
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,640
Nothing.

276
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,630
I'm used to it.

277
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,750
What brings you here today then?

278
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,480
I learned a new song yesterday.

279
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,750
I wanted to play it for you,

280
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,710
so I came here early in the morning.

281
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,390
Please forgive me

282
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,750
for disturbing you.

283
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,590
Play the music?

284
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,870
I'm just a businessman.

285
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,470
You may cast pearls before swine

286
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,230
if you do such elegant things

287
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,550
with me.

288
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,470
I remember when I was little,

289
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,830
Zihe liked to listen to me playing the zither.

290
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,630
I don't care if you admit

291
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,830
you are Feng Zihe.

292
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,710
Today,

293
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,040
just treat me as pitiful

294
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,710
and listen to this song.

295
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,850
Okay. Please do it.

296
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,210
Wait for me outside.

297
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,570
Miss Meng.

298
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,960
Wait for me in the yard.

299
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,790
Okay. Sister.

300
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,420
What do you mean?

301
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,670
Have you forgotten?

302
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,620
Ruoyu only plays the zither for Zihe alone.

303
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,580
Jin Gang.

304
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,330
Go out first

305
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,480
and see what Yu Xixi is doing.

306
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,380
Okay.

307
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,080
Please close the door

308
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,460
when you go out.

309
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
What should we do?

310
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,710
He's coming.

311
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,230
Don't worry. We'll see.

312
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,490
Hey.

313
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,730
Are you calling me?

314
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,400
There's no one else here.

315
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,710
I've long heard that the Yu family is wealthy and influential.

316
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,160
I wonder

317
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,270
if you are willing to accompany me for a stroll?

318
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,310
Okay.

319
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Let's go.

320
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,820
Miss Meng

321
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,590
has something.

322
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,990
Indeed.

323
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,630
We must burn incense

324
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,160
when playing this famous zither.

325
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,750
I specially brought

326
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,310
top-grade sandalwood from home.

327
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,150
I'll light it for you now.

328
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,230
It is called Truth Incense.

329
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,860
Special ointment needs to be applied in advance

330
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,390
as an antidote.

331
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,470
Then I'll start playing.

332
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,950
It has been half an hour.

333
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,000
Truth Incense should work now.

334
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,870
Zihe, don't blame me.

335
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
I had no choice.

336
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,380
Let's go.

337
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,330
Zihe.

338
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,660
You're Feng Zihe, right?

339
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,920
What did you say?

340
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,329
Louder.

341
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,720
Zihe.

342
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,270
Zihe.

343
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,680
Zihe.

344
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,250
Zihe.

345
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,590
Zihe.

346
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,170
Zihe.

347
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,880
You're Feng Zihe, right?

348
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,620
Louder!

349
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,440
Are you Feng Zihe?

350
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,720
Tell me.

351
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,350
You're Feng Zihe, right?

352
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,820
Xixi.

353
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,430
Xixi.

354
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,460
Zihe.

355
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,310
Zihe.

356
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,990
Young Master.

357
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,690
What happened?

358
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,350
Young Master.

359
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,710
Young Master!

360
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,920
Xixi.

361
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,230
Young Master.

362
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,070
Xiang.

363
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,130
What happened?

364
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,380
What should I say about you?

365
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,070
What are you doing?

366
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,070
Sir.

367
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,760
Please let us in.

368
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,910
Go in?

369
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,110
How can you get in this place?

370
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,160
How did they go in?

371
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
What do you mean?

372
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,870
How can they go in?

373
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,170
It's simple.

374
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,800
One tael.

375
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,150
Really?

376
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,580
You want to charge me for this?

377
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,310
What news!

378
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,250
What you see inside is really vivid.

379
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,310
I went out in a hurry and didn’t bring money.

380
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,040
Yunyun, did you bring any money?

381
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,790
Me neither.

382
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,630
No money?

383
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,750
Stand aside if you have no money.

384
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,730
It's so hot.

385
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,810
It's so hot.

386
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,020
Yu Xixi.

387
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,950
Lower your voice.

388
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:57,960
Okay.

389
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,150
Miss Yu.

390
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,150
I didn't know it was you.

391
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,630
Please come in.

392
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,640
I'll inform them.

393
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,310
Don't.

394
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,830
Don't tell anyone.

395
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,910
I understand.

396
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,890
It's an unexpected surprise.

397
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,960
I won't say it.

398
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,720
Please come in.

399
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,690
What now?

400
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,830
Miss Yu.

401
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,960
When you are with the young master,

402
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,830
don't forget to promote me.

403
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,470
Go away.

404
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:23,950
Go away.

405
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,380
Okay, I'll get lost now.

406
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,130
Forget it. Let's go.

407
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,860
Yu Xixi!

408
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Yu Xixi!

409
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,070
Miss Yu is here.

410
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,350
Music.

411
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,740
This is too exaggerated.

412
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,060
I'll go first.

413
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,140
Xixi.

414
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,210
I knew you would come.

415
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,900
Actually, I didn't want to come.

416
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,720
You don't have to tell me.

417
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,640
I understand.

418
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,350
I don't think you understand.

419
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,110
I understand.

420
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,250
Get together! Get together!

421
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,160
No. No.

422
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,350
No. No.

423
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,250
I asked you here today

424
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,720
to announce something.

425
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,510
Yes.

426
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,390
Xixi and I

427
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,670
will be together.

428
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,510
Why didn't I know?

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,010
I know.

430
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,520
You've been looking forward to it for a long time.

431
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,540
No. You don't know.

432
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,940
You're too excited to speak.

433
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,880
I've been talking.

434
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,930
It's okay.

435
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,780
Leave it to me.

436
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,720
Let me talk.

437
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,820
Okay, go ahead.

438
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,980
From now on,

439
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,390
no one can

440
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,250
separate us.

441
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
All present are witnesses.

442
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Good!

443
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,670
Bravo! Bravo!

444
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,790
Let her go!

445
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,540
Young Master! Slow down.

446
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,160
Move!

447
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,270
Isn't this Manager Yu?

448
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,110
Young Master.

449
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,270
Xixi.

450
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,100
You can't touch

451
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,180
the people of the Yu family!

452
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,360
Yu, what do you mean?

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,800
Xixi has made her own choice.

454
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,500
I...

455
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,790
Have you made your choice?

456
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,610
No.

457
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,150
Ye Chenxing.

458
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,110
I'm here to make it clear to you.

459
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,220
I only treat you as a friend.

460
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,840
Don't...

461
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,430
Don't...

462
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,390
What?

463
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,370
Don't flatter yourself.

464
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,850
Let's go home.

465
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,980
Xixi.

466
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,950
Stop looking.

467
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,590
The plan failed.

468
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,590
She's gone too.

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,330
Prepare the backup plan.

470
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,800
Sister.

471
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,990
What happened?

472
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,110
Isn't the plan flawless?

473
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,800
Yu Xixi.

474
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,720
Why are you looking at me like that?

475
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,530
Did you eat something wrong?

476
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,390
I think something is wrong with you.

477
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,450
I have to stay away from you.

478
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,770
I like you.

479
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,020
What did you say?

480
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,440
I like you.

481
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,570
Sometimes,

482
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,300
you can't judge if you like a person

483
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,940
with what you said,

484
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,790
you have to ask ask your own inner self.

485
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,270
Yu Xixi, you're doomed.
