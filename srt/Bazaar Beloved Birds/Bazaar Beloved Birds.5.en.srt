00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,900
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,610
What do you want to say?

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,510
Tell me now.

6
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,760
Zihe.

7
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,509
I don't know why

8
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,789
you don't remember me.

9
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,760
But if it's possible,

10
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,710
can you give me some time

11
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,830
to tell you

12
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,110
about our past?

13
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,870
When we were young,

14
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,460
they all called us childhood sweethearts.

15
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,350
It's really like what's written in the poem. While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,

16
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,650
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.

17
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,150
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse...

18
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,130
I've lived in Yu's mansion since I was a child.

19
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,250
I've never seen you before.

20
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,460
Maybe your old friend

21
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,930
looks like me.

22
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,220
Feng Zihe,

23
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,150
a martial arts genius.

24
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,760
When he was six,

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,180
he learned all the martial arts of the Golden Blade Sect

26
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,070
and was loved by Chief Feng.

27
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,730
At that time,

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,480
my father was not the Mirror Commander.

29
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,590
He was just a mirror guard of Mirror Department.

30
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,670
Back then, the relationship between the court

31
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,510
and the martial arts world was very good.

32
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,700
Zihe did a good job.

33
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,240
My father and Chief Feng

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,910
got acquainted at that time.

35
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,340
They had the same ambition,

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,230
so they called each other brothers.

37
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,110
Back then,

38
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,880
I was always with Zihe.

39
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,190
That was the happiest time

40
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:19,900
in my life.

41
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,710
It's just that the good times didn't last long.

42
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,300
Four years later,

43
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,350
the court and the martial world became enemies.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,920
My father became the Deputy Mirror Commander of the department.

45
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,950
In order to avoid suspicion,

46
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,829
he no longer contacted Chief Feng Lie.

47
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,530
Since then,

48
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,230
I have never seen Zihe again.

49
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,690
After that,

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,640
I heard that Zihe became insane.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,590
He harmed the martial arts world

52
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,030
because of his superb martial arts skills.

53
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,710
And Chief Feng became a public enemy

54
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,630
because he was eager to protect his son.

55
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,970
In one night,

56
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,750
all sects attacked the Golden Blade Sect.

57
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,070
Zihe and the Golden Blade Sect were buried together in the sea of fire.

58
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,760
The Knife Master's Red Jade of Cangqiong

59
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,020
disappeared too.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
He... He was buried in the sea of fire?

61
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Then why did you...

62
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,950
I don't believe Zihe is dead.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,150
I went to see the body.

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,150
It was burned beyond recognition.

65
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,630
But my instinct tells me

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,290
that wasn't Zihe.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,560
After that,

68
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,710
my father became the Mirror Commander

69
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,890
and got information of the entire martial arts world.

70
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,350
I often sneaked

71
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,720
into my dad's room

72
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,590
to gather information about Zihe.

73
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,909
A few days ago,

74
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,909
I found a note

75
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,250
on my father's desk.

76
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,710
It says

77
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,070
the Red Jade of Cangqiong will appear in Xianyun City.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
The appearance of the Red Jade of Cangqiong

79
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,150
may mean

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,790
that Zihe will also appear.

81
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,550
Because it's something

82
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,070
he wore since he was a child.

83
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,110
So I sneaked out.

84
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,090
I won't give up

85
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,070
even the slightest chance.

86
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,670
Yu Zhao...

87
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,150
After all, I'm the daughter of the Yu family.

88
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,550
He kicked my friend out like this.

89
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,220
How can I be respected in the Yu family

90
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,370
and Xianyun City in the future?

91
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,110
Yu Zhao!

92
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,910
Miss! Miss!

93
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,990
Please don't shout.

94
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,720
What's wrong? Where's Yu Zhao?

95
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,580
A girl wanted to talk with Young Master.

96
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,030
She's in the front hall now.

97
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,910
A girl?

98
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:30,980
Who?

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,230
She's the kind of person

100
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,790
who is beautiful, intelligent, and loved by everyone.

101
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,870
Really?

102
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,190
I want to see her.

103
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,430
Everyone loves her?

104
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,750
What if she compares to me?

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,320
Miss.

106
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,909
Why did you suddenly come back?

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,090
Because of Yu Zhao.

108
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,750
Ye Chenxing came to me today.

109
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,060
He drove him away directly.

110
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,390
The more I thought about it, the more angry I became.

111
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,170
So I came here.

112
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,450
I didn't expect him to secretly meet a beauty here.

113
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,430
Are you furious?

114
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,630
A little.

115
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,270
Is it hard to hide the anger in your heart?

116
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,420
Yes.

117
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,950
Are you jealous?

118
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,450
Yes.

119
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,190
Why would I be jealous?

120
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,680
How could I be jealous because of him?

121
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,510
Anyway,

122
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,740
we will always support you.

123
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,790
That's right, Miss.

124
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,590
We will always be your strong support.

125
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,510
Okay. Backup. Let's go.

126
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,190
Let's go.

127
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,060
Miss. Young Master is meeting a guest.

128
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,740
No. Uncle San. What are you doing?

129
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,909
Zihe.

130
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,740
Please recognize me.

131
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,290
Miss. You let go.

132
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:46,900
Xixi. You are here.

133
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,550
This is...

134
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,810
Let me introduce. This is...

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm Liu Ruoyu,

136
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,550
the daughter of the Mirror Commander.

137
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,870
The Mirror Commander?

138
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,630
It's the third rank official

139
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,440
in charge of the martial arts world for the court.

140
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,550
The steward.

141
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,830
Okay, got it.

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,710
May I ask who you are?

143
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,790
She is...

144
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,310
Why did you appear in the main hall of the Yu Mansion

145
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,630
wearing servant clothes?

146
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,950
Let me introduce myself.

147
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,070
Yu Xixi.

148
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,040
The true daughter of the Yu family.

149
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,630
Well. It's really hard to tell.

150
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:39,770
You...

151
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,890
Excuse me.

152
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,670
Miss Liu.

153
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,750
Why did you come to look for Yu Zhao Yu Zhao today?

154
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,150
Yu Zhao?

155
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,510
Who is Yu Zhao?

156
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm here to see my Zihe.

157
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,820
What? Did you change your name?

158
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,970
No.

159
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,070
Zihe is my childhood friend.

160
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,250
Miss Liu. Are you sick?

161
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,910
Why are you talking nonsense?

162
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,830
Yu Mansion is not a clinic.

163
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,270
We can't cure you.

164
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,310
Zihe is the medicine for my illness.

165
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,890
I think you took the wrong medicine.

166
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Sometimes,

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,300
the medicine won't take effect so quickly.

168
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,830
We need to wait.

169
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,970
It seems that

170
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,260
you don't welcome me.

171
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,590
Then I'll go back to Huixian Restaurant

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,110
and wait for my medicine to take effect.

173
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,470
Huixian Restaurant?

174
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,960
I have already booked a first-class room

175
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,429
at Huixian Restaurant.

176
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,630
Does Huixian Restaurant

177
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,950
opens its doors for business

178
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,270
but not allow people to enter?

179
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,950
No.

180
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,710
Please do whatever you want.

181
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,630
Miss has slim chances of winning.

182
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,760
Well done! Yu Zhao!

183
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,200
You don't allow me to interact with Ye Chenxing.

184
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,550
But you met a beauty here in secret.

185
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,320
I...

186
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,020
What?

187
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:12,780
You...

188
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,390
What?

189
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,600
You misunderstood me.

190
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,630
What did I misunderstand?

191
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,540
Did you forget?

192
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,260
You kept calling her Miss Liu.

193
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,870
And you even...

194
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,830
Why don't you treat me like that?

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,040
Clearly I wanted to push her away.

196
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,270
And she's a guest.

197
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
You're not a guest.

198
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,630
A guest?

199
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,260
So you treat a guest like that?

200
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,640
I really don't know her.

201
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,870
Oh my god. Yu Zhao.

202
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,320
You didn't know her,

203
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,710
but you cheated her feelings

204
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,580
and didn't admit it.

205
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,870
You are so cruel.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,230
What did I cheat her?

207
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,480
You're quite smart.

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,470
You even know to give yourself a stage name when playing around.

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,100
Zihe. Bah!

210
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

211
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,870
I can smell it.

212
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,590
What?

213
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,010
You are jealous.

214
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,590
Jealous?

215
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,800
No.

216
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,550
I'm not jealous.

217
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,420
You hear me? I'm not jealous.

218
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,430
I didn't know you're here.

219
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,390
Please forgive me

220
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,040
for not greeting you in advance.

221
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,740
Master Ye. Please get up.

222
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,400
My lord, you...

223
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,490
Ruoyu ran away from home last night.

224
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,070
She must have gone to Xianyun City.

225
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,270
Miss Ruoyu?

226
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,390
Why did she do this?

227
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,870
She saw the letter you wrote to me.

228
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,160
I'll send someone to escort her back.

229
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,780
Protect her secretly.

230
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,150
I understand.

231
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,190
How's the matter with the Red Jade of Cangqiong?

232
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,580
I'm working on it.

233
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,630
Please rest assured. Mirror Commander.

234
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,200
[Lu Ming Garden]

235
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,430
Young Master.

236
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,190
The daughter of the Mirror Commander Liu Ruoyu

237
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,230
has come to Xianyun City.

238
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,350
Master asked us to secretly protect her.

239
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,910
You can leave now.

240
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,830
Tell me in detail.

241
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,120
The daughter of Mirror Commander

242
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,680
and Feng Zihe grew up together.

243
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,510
After meeting Yu Zhao yesterday,

244
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,870
she stayed at Huixian Restaurant.

245
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,590
Is Yu Zhao...

246
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,140
Master also asked us

247
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,590
to use Liu Ruoyu

248
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,250
at an appropriate time.

249
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,640
I see.

250
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,760
Send some masters to protect her secretly.

251
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm going to see Yu Zhao now.

252
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,740
Along the way, I'll find another chance

253
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
to meet Liu Ruoyu.

254
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,830
Okay.

255
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,680
Feng Zihe.

256
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,310
Cheers.

257
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,480
Yunyun, you are so nice to me.

258
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,670
Every time you visit me,

259
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,950
you bring me good drinks.

260
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,820
We're good friends. Don't be so polite.

261
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,430
I didn't expect

262
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,900
that you would still be willing to be friends with me

263
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,930
after I became a servant from the daughter of the Yu family.

264
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,860
If you were a man,

265
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:53,710
I would marry you.

266
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,550
Stop.

267
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,880
I can't afford

268
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,930
to offend Manager Yu.

269
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Don’t mention him.

270
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,790
Yunyun,

271
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,190
let me ask you something.

272
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,160
I have a good friend.

273
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,350
She doesn't like a boy.

274
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,510
But every time

275
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,950
she sees that boy with another woman,

276
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,940
she gets very angry.

277
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,100
Why?

278
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,750
Yu Xixi.

279
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,270
Do you have any particularly good friends

280
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,630
besides me?

281
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,030
Oh.

282
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,440
You have secrets now.

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,990
No.

284
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,030
She is really

285
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,350
a very good friend of mine.

286
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,900
What's wrong

287
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,710
with your really close friend?

288
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,440
Do you know the reason

289
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,870
why she would get angry?

290
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,190
She's jealous.

291
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,430
How could I?

292
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,890
I...

293
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
My good friend

294
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,910
definitely doesn't like that man.

295
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,830
Listen.

296
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,940
You don't understand.

297
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,960
Sometimes,

298
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,620
you can't judge whether you like a person

299
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,360
with what you say.

300
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,110
You need to ask your own inner self.

301
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,710
Sometimes,

302
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,190
you say you don't like him,

303
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,470
but your heart

304
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,570
has silently made a choice for you.

305
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,300
So, follow your heart.

306
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,880
Follow my heart?

307
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,890
All right.

308
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,340
I have a soccer date.

309
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,660
I have no time to talk to you.

310
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,930
Take your time to figure it out.

311
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,040
Follow my heart.

312
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,590
Hey. You've never loved anyone either, have you?

313
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:25,920
You're wrong.

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,350
I don't like him.

315
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,160
Definitely not.

316
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:50,110
[Yu Mansion]

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,750
Yu Mansion.

318
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,830
Who is it?

319
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,990
Excuse me.

320
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,550
I'm Ye Chenxing.

321
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,970
I want to see Manager Yu.

322
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,560
Our young master doesn't see guests.

323
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,870
Do you have anything else to do?

324
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,550
I'm an old friend of your young master.

325
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,430
Our young master has no old friends.

326
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,270
In that case,

327
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,750
don't blame me for being rude.

328
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,430
You think you can stop me with this height?

329
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,640
Ridiculous.

330
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,750
Are you surprised?

331
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,690
How could you

332
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,830
break into Yu Mansion?

333
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,710
It's a misunderstanding.

334
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,300
Listen to me.

335
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,860
Misunderstanding?

336
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,350
Guards. Someone broke into Yu Mansion without permission.

337
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,670
I'll catch you!

338
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,070
Catch him!

339
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,530
Catch him!

340
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,550
Catch him!

341
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,900
Together. Catch him!

342
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,850
Together. Don't let him escape.

343
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,350
Forgive me for not being able to

344
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,740
bow to Manager Yu now.

345
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,390
Stop!

346
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,870
Get him!

347
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,630
Stop.

348
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,910
Today,

349
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
I specially came to see you today.

350
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,310
Young Master Ye, why did you come to Yu Mansion

351
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,270
so enthusiastically?

352
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,210
I have something important to tell you.

353
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,470
Then let's talk here.

354
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,400
Here?

355
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,180
I don't think it's a good place.

356
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,010
Okay, come with me to the front hall.

357
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,230
Mr. Yu, please.

358
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,920
What's the use of you?

359
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,710
A bunch of losers.

360
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,480
Miss Yu.

361
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,910
Isn't this Miss Yu?

362
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,030
If I'm not mistaken,

363
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,819
Miss Yu is the servant now, right?

364
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,130
Sister.

365
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,310
Miss Yu is really in the humour.

366
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,579
She's the daughter of Huixian Restaurant,

367
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,880
but she likes serving people.

368
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,839
We ordinary people

369
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,920
can't understand it.

370
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,690
-I…
-Miss.

371
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,910
You don't look well today.

372
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,770
I guess

373
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,540
you didn't get the medicine last night.

374
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,680
No hurry.

375
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,350
I have plenty of time.

376
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,760
Miss Meng.

377
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,150
I'm a little hungry.

378
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,570
Shall we sit down

379
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,480
and try the cooking of Huixian Restaurant?

380
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,030
Sure, sister.

381
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,800
Go.

382
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,860
This way, please.

383
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,710
Miss Liu.

384
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,070
Let me recommend

385
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,240
our signature dishes here.

386
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Ask Yu Xixi to serve us.

387
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,030
She...

388
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,560
Is it that difficult?

389
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,030
Or

390
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,250
does Huixian Building

391
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,270
bully the customers?

392
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,430
No.

393
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,930
Miss Liu, please wait a moment.

394
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,710
Miss.

395
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,670
What's wrong?

396
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,290
Miss Liu asked you to serve her.

397
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,510
Me?

398
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,340
Oh my bad temper.

399
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,670
Miss,

400
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,510
I think you should go there.

401
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,950
You're the servant now and she's a customer.

402
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,760
You should

403
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,140
serve her.

404
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,220
You...

405
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,360
Besides, you

406
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,750
have a gambling agreement with the young master.

407
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,470
If she speaks ill of you,

408
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,110
the young master will definitely punish you,

409
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,710
right?

410
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,290
Bear with it for a while. Everything will be fine.

411
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,400
What brings you here, Master Ye?

412
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,990
Are you here to enjoy tea?

413
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,390
Nothing.

414
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,380
I just want to have a chat with you.

415
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,750
I'm busy.

416
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,960
I don't have time to chat.

417
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,270
If you have nothing to do,

418
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,520
please leave.

419
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,320
It seems that you have

420
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,990
a prejudice against me.

421
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,830
No.

422
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,060
I just don't like you.

423
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,750
Since you are so forthright,

424
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,620
I won't beat around the bush.

425
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,050
I heard that

426
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,710
you have

427
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,190
a top-quality red jade.

428
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,350
I wonder

429
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,990
if you can

430
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,500
show it to me.

431
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,090
I have a lot of red jade at home.

432
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,760
They are all valuable.

433
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,470
Which one are you talking about?

434
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,600
The other half of the red jade

435
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,390
at Xixi's auction.

436
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,930
That one?

437
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,630
Yes.

438
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,240
That's a very ordinary red jade.

439
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,670
It's nothing.

440
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,570
Besides,

441
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,750
why should I show it to you?

442
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,880
I wonder

443
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,110
if you heard of

444
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,440
the Red Jade of Cangqiong?

445
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,190
What is that?

446
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,520
Rumor has it that

447
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,080
the red jade in your hand

448
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,290
is the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

449
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,790
Go ahead.

450
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,920
Fine.

451
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,700
Since you want to hear a story from me,

452
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,320
I'll tell you a story.

453
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,950
A story

454
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,350
about the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

455
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,660
At first,

456
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,560
there were three sects.

457
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,430
Golden Blade Sect, Lu Ming Manor

458
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,080
and Yixiao Hall.

459
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,970
The swordsmanship of the Golden Blade Sect

460
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,400
was fierce.

461
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,590
And it had strong soldiers and sturdy horses.

462
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,590
So its branches spread throughout the world.

463
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,700
It was the greatest sect in the world.

464
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,890
Feng Lie, the head of the Golden Blade Sect,

465
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,190
was also a top martial artist.

466
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
People called him the Knife Master.

467
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,550
Lu Ming Manor was a famous martial arts sect.

468
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,430
It had many disciples in plain clothes with silver swords.

469
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,680
The Lu Ming Sword

470
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,150
was awe inspiring in the martial arts world.

471
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,540
Ye Yunqing, head of Lu Ming Manor,

472
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,170
was upright.

473
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,150
People called him the Sword Master.

474
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,670
Yixiao Hall.

475
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,110
It was more like a chamber of commerce

476
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,440
rather than a gang.

477
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,200
It was in charge of the business in the world.

478
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,060
Their spies were everywhere.

479
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,610
Haili Yuan, Yixiao Hall's master,

480
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,710
was smart and capable.

481
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,890
He controlled this vast wealth network

482
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,220
and intelligence system.

483
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,190
People called him the Laughing Master.

484
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,600
The martial arts world had been separated for a long time

485
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,830
and the sects fought against each other.

486
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,340
It was a foul wind and a rain of blood.

487
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,410
Feng Lie, Ye Yunqing, and Haili Yuan.

488
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
The three men standing at the top of the world

489
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,700
decided to become sworn brothers

490
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,750
to end the struggles in the martial arts world.

491
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,040
To ensure the stability of the martial arts world,

492
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,110
they found a piece of red jade

493
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,310
and divided into three.

494
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,500
It symbolized their rule over the martial arts world.

495
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,680
The centers of the three red jade

496
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,630
were carved with totems of the three sects.

497
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,390
Fire Phoenix, Crane and Flood Dragon.

498
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,550
These three red jade

499
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,510
are called the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

500
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,440
All sects recommended Feng Lie, the oldest one,

501
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,720
as the Head of Wulin,

502
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,380
assisted by Ye Yunqing and Haili yuan.

503
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,830
They were known as

504
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,030
Hero Knife, Sword and Laugh.

505
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,630
The world started the era of Three Heroes since then.

506
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,700
In the beginning, they lived at peace.

507
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,030
Later,

508
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,110
the son of Chief Feng of the Golden Blade Sect,

509
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,450
Feng Zihe was born.

510
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,240
When Feng Zi He was ten,

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
he lost his mind while practicing

512
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,050
and became demonic.

513
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,640
At the same time,

514
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,840
there was a rumor that

515
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,180
the demon boy was going to destroy the martial world.

516
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,380
All sects asked Chief Feng to hand over his son.

517
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,300
Chief Feng was eager to protect his son

518
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,680
and refused their request.

519
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,330
Unexpectedly, all sects

520
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,020
attacked the Golden Blade Sect,

521
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,640
Causing the tragic death of Feng Lie

522
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,710
and all members of the Golden Blade Sect.

523
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,150
Feng Zihe, the eldest son of Feng Lie,

524
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,240
was burned to death.

525
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,520
His youngest son, Feng Zihuan, disappeared.

526
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,410
Feng Lie's Red Jade of Cangqiong

527
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,720
[Heartless]

528
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,960
was also missing.

529
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,810
That night,

530
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,790
Yixiao Hall was also robbed.

531
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,400
Master Hai and his family were wiped out.

532
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,630
The era of Three Heroes officially ended.

533
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,130
Wonderful.

534
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,910
The story is a good.

535
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,310
But I don't know what it has to do with me.

536
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,220
In that case,

537
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,450
I'll leave you alone.

538
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:06,920
Bye.

539
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:46,710
Young Master.

540
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,550
Miss Liu is here.

541
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,800
I'm Ye Chenxing, the young master of Lu Ming Manor.

542
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,000
Greetings, Miss Liu.

543
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,250
Lu Ming Manor.

544
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,790
I seem to have heard about it from my father.

545
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,670
Why are you here?

546
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,000
Under the order of Mirror Commander,

547
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,360
I'll protect you secretly.

548
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,220
I'm fine.

549
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,770
I don't need your protection.

550
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,280
But let me tell you,

551
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,870
if you come to catch me,

552
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,280
I won't go with you.

553
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,560
If you dare to force me,

554
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,010
I'll jump from here.

555
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,630
You think too much.

556
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,220
You can go wherever you want

557
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,320
and do whatever you want.

558
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,630
I won't interfere.

559
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,260
I'm just protecting you in secret.

560
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,280
Really?

561
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,110
Father didn't ask you to catch me?

562
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,710
Of course not.

563
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,170
Then what do you want from me?

564
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,190
If there's nothing else,

565
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,190
I’m leaving.

566
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,990
Please wait a moment.

567
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
What do you mean?

568
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Didn't you say

569
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,350
I can go wherever I want?

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,070

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,410
to make a deal.

573
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,750
A deal?
