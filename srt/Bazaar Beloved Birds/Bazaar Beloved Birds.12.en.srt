00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,280
What brings you here today?

7
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to know

8

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
Why do you ask about him?

11
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,190
Nothing.

12
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,320
Everyone says he's a devil child

13
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,930
and a scourge.

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,010
Is that true?

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,040
A lie, if repeated often enough, will be accepted as truth.

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,820
You must know

17
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,710

A scourge?

22
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,940
Impossible.

But everyone says he’s the devil child.

26

No one can escape from their fate.

I have a feeling.

41

The danger

42
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,790

43

Do you have to do like this?

Aren't you tired?

I'm tired.

No.

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,070
I've been practicing martial arts since young.

48

I'll change it, okay?

I like everything about you.

Gosh, we are not suitable for each other.

53

You're younger than me.

So what?

55

I'm taller than you.

56
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
I've seen many young masters

57
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,630

58
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,920
You don't know what you really want.

59

You like this today,

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,270
then tomorrow you like that.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,480
I'm not a young master.

62
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,000
My parents died when I was young.

63
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,670
I grew up with two masters.

64

I'm sorry.

65

It’s Okay.

I won’t be mad at Yunyun.

67
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,920
Don’t call me Yunyun.

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,470
Then what should I call you?

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,380
You're older than me.

70
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,580
Why don't I call you sister?

71
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,790
Forget it. Whatever.

Just give up.

We are not suitable for each other.

77

You haven't even tried.

78
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,670
How do you know we are not suitable?

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,810
I have no feelings for you.

80
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,270
I always think that the two people in love

81
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,510
are destined to be together.

82
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,990
Do you think

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,230

84
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,630
Yes.

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,740
I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.

86
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,190
You don't know what destiny is.

87

Let me teach you.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
Destiny is...

89
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,950
For example,

90
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,080
it's a sunny day now, right?

91
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,820
If we are destined to be together,

92
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,060
it will rain heavily.

93
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,030

95
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,550

if we are destined to be together,

97
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,780
it's raining now, right?

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,210
It will clear up immediately.

99
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,080
It's strange.

No.

I mean,

103
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,750
if we're really destined to be together,

104
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,950
it'll rain again now.

Do you believe it?

What did you say?

115

Nothing.

116

How dare you say that?

123

You kidnapped me before.

What? Now you want to chase Yunyun?

125
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,210

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,070
It's a long journey.

195
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,510
How can I let her go alone?

196
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,380
Then

197
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,750
will we never see each other again?

198
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,910
I had a good time these days.

199
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,880
I'll remember you.

200
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,860
There's another possibility.

201
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,030
Feng Zihe

202
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,630
didn't die at that time.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,880
He was saved.

204
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,110
The red jade is still with him.

205
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,790
That's the scariest thing.

206
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,910
After all, the one who has the red jade

207
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,940
is very likely to be Feng Zihe.

208
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,750
The devil child.

209
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,110
No one can escape their fate.

210
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,950
Making early plans

211
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,160
is the best choice

212
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,820
for you and the people around you.

213
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,010
I have a feeling.

214
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,000
The danger

215
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,510
is coming.

216
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,360
Xixi.

217
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
What should I do?

218
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,680
Welcome.

219
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,450
Xixi.

220
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,420
Ye Chenxing!

221
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,790
Where have you been?

222
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,500
Do you treat me as your friend?

223
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,650
Why didn't you tell me?

224
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,590
I went back to the villa.

225
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,750
My father wanted to see me.

226
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,110
This...

227
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
This person is...

228
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,510
It's a long story.

229
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,430
I'll tell you later.

230
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,920
Tell me what happened to you first.

231
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,240
My father wanted to see me.

232
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,150
Something urgent.

233
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,730
You people in the martial arts world do things so casually.

234
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,740
Find a seat first.

235
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,590
Xixi.

236
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,750
I have something to tell you.

237
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,640
Let's talk here.

238
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,660
It is

239
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,820
not a good place.

240
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,980
I want to talk to you alone.

241
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,830
Okay, let's go.

242
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,630
Let's go.

243
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,190
You can tell me now.

244
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,550
Do you want to know

245
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,030
who your biological parents are?

246
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,010
Of course.

247
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,830
Do you know?

248
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,670
No.

249
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,150
But my father found out.

250
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,840
Then take me to your father.

251
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,630
My father said

252
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,280
if you could persuade Yu Zhao

253
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,110
to hold the Martial Arts Competition in Yu's territory,

254
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,670
he would take you to your parents.

255
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
The Martial Arts Competition?

256
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,240
My father has issued a summoning order.

257
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:18,940
In five days,

258
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,440
the Wulin Assembly will be held in the Yu family's territory.

259
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,280
But

260
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,870
it's not up to me to decide.

261
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,860
That's why

262
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,470
I need you to persuade Yu Zhao.

263
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,640
I...

264
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,950
Holding the Martial Arts Competition

265
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,270
has another advantage.

266
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,750
What is it?

267
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,880
The bet!

268
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,590
The cost

269
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,890
of holding the Wulin Assembly

270
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,950
is 5,000 taels.

271
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,870
5,000 taels?

272
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,550
You can have

273
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,700
at least a 10% share of the money, right?

274
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,190
That's 500 taels.

275
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,310
With 500 taels,

276
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,610
you can win the bet, right?

277
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,120
I...

278
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,230
This is all earned by yourself.

279
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,660
You can find your parents

280
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,890
and win the bet.

281
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,230
It's like killing two birds with one stone.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,690
The Martial Arts Competition?

283
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,840
What do you think?

284
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,870
Kill two birds with one stone.

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,560
I've been here for so many years.

286
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,810
I still don't know what my parents look like.

287
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,470
And they will give us 5,000 taels.

288
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,430
This is a large amount of income.

289
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,550
I don't agree.

290
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,550
Why?

291
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,350
I said no.

292
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,470
Stop talking about this.

293
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,200
If you don't want to talk,

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,470
you have to give me a reason.

295
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,710
Listen.

296
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,110
I don't want Huixian Restaurant to get involved with the martial arts world.

297
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,130
And I don’t want you to get involved in the martial arts world.

298
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,780
The martial arts world...

299
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,710
Why do you always have prejudice against the martial arts world?

300
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,950
Did they offend you?

301
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,430
You know nothing about the martial arts world.

302
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,800
Do you know the martial arts world?

303
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,320
Of course.

304
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,090
In novels, they come straight to the point

305
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,070
and have a strong sense of justice and ready to help the weak.

306
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,510
Those are stories from storytellers.

307
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,670
Have you ever seen the real martial arts world?

308
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,610
Do you know how dangerous it is?

309
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,050
Do you know the world?martial arts world?

310
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,310
Stop your prejudice.

311
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,230
My prejudice?

312
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,350
Yes.

313
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
You have prejudice against the martial arts world.

314
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,110
The Martial Arts Competition.

315
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,610
What a grand event!

316
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,150
And if we really hold it at Huixian Restaurant,

317
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,990
we will make a hit, right?

318
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,380
I don't want to.

319
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,750
Why are you so stubborn?

320
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,070
Can't you think about it?

321
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,970
I don't need to think about it.

322
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,400
But...

323
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,550
But what?

324
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,600
I said no.

325
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,390
Do you understand?

326
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,830
Why are you so fierce?

327
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,510
I'm talking to you nicely.

328
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,280
I know.

329
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,680
You just want me to suffer.

330
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,590
You don't want me to find my parents,

331
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,070
and you don't want me to complete the bet.

332
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,890
That's why

333
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,150
you can trap me in the Yu Mansion

334
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,680
to satisfy your desire to control me.

335
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,030
The Yu family is like a cage.

336
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,450
You are the gatekeeper of the cage.

337
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,950
It's Ye Chenxing again.

338
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,200
Xiang.

339
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,950
Do you think the Martial Arts Competition can be held?

340
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,510
Everyone can see that

341
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,820
Manager Yu

342
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,650
doesn't like Ye Chenxing.

343
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,860
Well,

344
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,070
it is hard to say.

345
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,670
In fact, our young master is very accommodating to Miss Xixi.

346
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,510
But he can't express himself.

347
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,110
Your young master can't,

348
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,750
what about your Miss Xixi?

349
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,460
I think

350
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,910
she is eager

351
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,620
to marry your young master.

352
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,710
Really?

353
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,870
That's great.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,260
In this way,

355
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,450
Madam can rest in peace.

356
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:25,880
Xiang.

357
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,750
What do you think of

358
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,320
him?

359
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,790
He...

360
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,440
When

361
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,470
we first met,

362
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,470
he was malicious-looking

363
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,340
and scary.

364
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,800
But gradually,

365
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,090
he seems quite innocent and cute.

366
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,110
Really? I don't think so.

367
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,960
Miss, what’s wrong?

368
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,580
Does Young Master disagree?

369
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,710
Yu Zhao

370
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,440
is deliberately against me.

371
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,790
What did he say about the Martial Arts Competition?

372
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,270
What Martial Arts Competition?

373
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,450
It's all ruined.

374
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,400
Don't worry.

375
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,950
Maybe you can give Yu Zhao some time

376
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,030
to change his mind,

377
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,800
right?

378
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,069
If Yu Zhao can change his mind,

379
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,510
the sun will rise from the west.

380
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,800
[Lu Ming Garden]

381
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,310
Manager Yu,

382
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,670
you must be here for the Martial Arts Competition, right?

383
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,950
You should talk with me about what you want.

384
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,760
I don't understand.

385
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,910
Is it wrong for me to let you make money?

386
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,950
Then why does your father

387
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,589
know

388
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,339
about Yu Xixi's biological parents?

389
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,369
My father's spies are all over the world.

390
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,970
It's not hard to find someone.

391
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,510
I don't care what you think.

392
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,390
You should stop thinking about it.

393
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,790
And you're not allowed to covet Yu Xixi.

394
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,590
What are you talking about, Manager Yu?

395
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,170
I mean no harm.

396
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,820
Lu Ming Manor

397
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,070
wants to hold the Martial Arts Competition in Xianyun City.

398
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,680
And the Yu family

399
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,630
is the top merchant of Xianyun City.

400
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,630
Of course we should hold it in the Yu family's property.

401
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,970
In this way, Lu Ming Manor will gain face.

402
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,030
Remember,

403
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,510
the Yu family won't have anything to do with the martial arts world.

404
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,380
If you do this,

405
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
it will be difficult for me to explain when I go back.

406
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,590
That's your business.

407
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,830
It has nothing to do with me.

408
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,140
How about this?

409
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,130
As long as Manager Yu

410
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,820
allows us to hold the Martial Arts Competition at Huixian Restaurant,

411
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,590
then

412
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,680
after the Martial Arts Competition,

413
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,740
I will leave Xianyun City.

414
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,480
I will never appear in front of you and Yu Xixi again.

415
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,000
How can I trust you?

416
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,040
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

417
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,990
I have no choice.

418
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,910
But

419
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,910
if you refuse this opportunity,

420
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,990
then

421
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,550
I will always pester you

422
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,550
and Yu Xixi.

423
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,740
You are a smart man.

424
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,470
You must know what to choose.

425
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,050
Okay.

426
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,740
The Yu family will hold the Martial Arts Competition.

427
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,630
I hope you can keep your promise.

428
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,280
Send someone to send a letter to Father.

429
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,440
Everything is settled?

430
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,070
Yes.

431
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,750
Enjoy yourselves.

432
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,470
Young Master.

433
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,860
Young Master, you're here.

434
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,400
Why are you here?

435
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,150
None of your business.

436
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,620
Manager Yu.

437
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,700
Huo came with me to the Public House to help out.

438
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,250
What can he do?

439
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,990
At least Huo

440
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,140
can help,

441
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,190
unlike Manager Yu

442
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,600
who always bosses us around.

443
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,310
Leave if you have nothing to do.

444
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,630
Don't stand in my way.

445
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,260
Young Master, this way please.

446
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,310
Yu Xixi.

447
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,870
Yu Xixi.

448
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,560
The Martial Arts Competition!

449
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,310
The Martial Arts Competition?

450
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,520
Do you want to hold it?

451
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,010
Yes.

452
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,160
Come with me.

453
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,180
Xiang.

454
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,150
We have a chance.

455
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,030
Do you really want

456
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,560
to hold the Martial Arts Competition?

457
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,250
If you know where your parents are and fulfill the bet,

458
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,270
what will you do?

459
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,550
I...

460
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,730
Will you leave the Yu Mansion?

461
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,150
I don't know.

462
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,280
I agree.

463
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,350
I agree that the Yu Mansion

464
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,170
will hold the Martial Arts Competition.

465
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,640
And you're in full charge.

466
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,830
Uncle San will help you.

467
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,160
Really?

468
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,640
I...

469
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,880
Great.

470
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,760
What's the situation now?

471
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,230
What did Young Master say?

472
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,400
Yu Zhao.

473
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,870
He agreed to let me hold the Martial Arts Competition.

474
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,580
Really?

475
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,950
Yes. And I will be in full charge.

476
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
Why did Young Master suddenly agree?

477
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,860
Why?

478
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,750
I don't know.

479
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,390
But it doesn't matter.

480
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,790
I announce

481
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,500
that we will go to the martial arts world tomorrow morning.

482
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,380
No, we'll go to Huixian Restaurant

483
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,570
to hold the Martial Arts Competition.

484
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,310
I must make this Martial Arts Competition

485
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,230
the best one.

486
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,700
And everyone will remember it.

487
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,500
Okay.

488
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,250
[Business closed today]

489
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,550
I believe everyone knows about

490
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,830
the Martial Arts Competition.

491
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,190
We have a tight schedule and a heavy task.

492
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,970
So please stay alert.

493
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,140
Today, let's assign the tasks.

494
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,870
We'll start preparing tomorrow.

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
What about Manager Yu?

496
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,310
Yu Zhao

497
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,330
has fully entrusted this matter to me.

498
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,270
On the day of the Martial Arts Competition,

499
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,510
will Manager Yu

500
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,660
come?

501
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,820
I don't know.

502
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,640
But it doesn't matter if he comes or not.

503
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,070
He's not a martial artist.

504
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,420
Do you not trust me?

505
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,710
Don't worry.

506
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,870
Even if Yu Zhao doesn't come,

507
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,750
I will do my best to hold the Martial Arts Competition.

508
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,790
Alright.

509
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,560
Okay.

510
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,460
Next, Young Master Ye,

511
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,530
please tell us the matters related to the Martial Arts Competition.

512
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,060
Welcome.

513
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,990
The Martial Arts Competition

514
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,250
has always been summoned

515
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,110
by Master Knife, Sword and Laugh.

516
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,470
Each summoning order

517
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,310
bears three marks of the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

518
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,820
That's why it's called the Sanxia Summoning Order.

519
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,990
But

520
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,020
since the accidents of the Laugh Master and the Knife Master,

521
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,650
my father...

522
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,140
What?

523
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,550
Nothing, Young Master Ye. Go on.

524
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,910
My father keeps a low profile.

525
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,840
He only studies martial arts all day long.

526
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,210
But now,

527
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,270
he decided to take on the responsibility

528
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,040
of the Sword Master

529
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,470
and hold the Martial Arts Competition

530
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
to select a new leader

531
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,080
and rebuild the order of the martial arts world.

532
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,990
Young Master Ye.

533
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,180
Uncle San, what's wrong?

534
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,520
May I ask one question?

535
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,470
Now that the Knife Master and the Laugh Master are gone,

536
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,510
the Sword Master issued the summoning order alone.

537
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,520
Is it possible

538
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,030
that no one will come?

539
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,830
Don't worry.

540
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,610
After all, my father is the Sword Master.

541
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,870
People

542
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,560
in the martial arts world

543
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,940
will give him some face.

544
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,900
By the way, where was I?

545
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,590
Order in the martial arts world.

546
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,610
That's right.

547
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,950
My father decided to take the responsibility of the Sword Master

548
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,910
and rebuild the order of the martial arts world.

549
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,070
There are eight orders in total.

550
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,980
They are sent to

551
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,490
the most famous eight sects in the martial arts world.

552
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,230
For example, Yanzi Alliance in Hebei,

553
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,710
Qingcheng Sect in Sichuan

554
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,070
and Yunyi Sect in Jiangnan.

555
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,340
Among these sects,

556
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,870
except for a few who don't agree with my father,

557
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,950
the rest

558
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,030
have decided to participate in the Martial Arts Competition.

559
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,700
Hebei, Sichuan, Jiangnan.

560
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,940
Uncle San.

561
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,590
The food in these three regions

562
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,660
are all different, right?

563
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,650
Yes, Miss.

564
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,850
Listen.

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,860
Southern people like sweets and North people like saltiness.

566
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,120
But Sichuan people like spicy food.

567
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,540
Chop the ginger, garlic, and chives into small pieces,

568
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,610
add water and mash them into a paste,

569
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,750
then add pepper and salt.

570
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,110
That

571
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,470
tastes perfect.

572
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,870
Uncle San. You know how to cook it?

573
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,150
Of course.

574
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,270
Back then,

575
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,070
I was...

576
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,820
Sorry, Young Master Ye. Go on.

577
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,370
Forget it. I'll stop.

578
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,650
If you have any questions,

579
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,550
just ask me.

580
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,670
I have a question.

581
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,080
I want to know

582
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,820
how many people will come.

583
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,190
Is the Huixian Restaurant sufficient for living?

584
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,160
Don't worry.

585
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,490
Only the most famous eight sects will come.

586
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,520
According to the rules set by the Three Heroes,

587
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
each sect leader

588
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,470
can bring two trusted followers at most.

589
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,230
There are 24 people in total.

590
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,110
Uncle San.

591
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,700
How many empty rooms are there tomorrow?

592
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,550
Less than ten rooms left.

593
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,070
Ten?

594
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,580
That should be enough.

595
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,690
Eight masters will live in Huixian Restaurant.

596
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,030
The rest of them

597
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,230
will live in the nearby inns.

598
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,890
Xiang, make arrangements.

599
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,830
Okay, Miss.

600
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,200
By the way, Young Master Ye,

601
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,370
send me the list tomorrow.

602
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,470
Okay.

603
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,630
Uncle San.

604
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,710
Cook different types of dishes

605
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,790
according to the list.

606
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,120
OK. Miss, I’m good at this.

607
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,470
By the way, Yunyun,

608
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,610
I need your help.

609
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,650
The decoration of our venue

610
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,960
is not the style.

611
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,880
Decorate each sect master’s rooms

612
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,150
according to their preference

613
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,350
so that every master

614
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,960
will feel at home.

615
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,250
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

616
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,230
Young Master Ye,

617
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,670
don't forget our agreement.

618
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,350
No matter what,

619
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,550
we must hold

620
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,500
the Martial Arts Competition well.

621
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,040
[Lu Ming Manor]

622
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,670
Master, Young Master sent a message.

623
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,320
Everything is ready and waiting for the good news.

624
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,510
Tell Young Master.

625
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,450
Everything goes according to plan.

626
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,290
We'll meet at the Martial Arts Competition.

627
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,530
Yes.
