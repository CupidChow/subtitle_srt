00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,910
Lord Shadow has ordered.

6
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,190
We need to tighten the security recently.

7
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,690
Yes.

8
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,930
Wealth.

9
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,090
Let's go.

10
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,470
Move.

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,470
Gosh.

12
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,070
It's a stray dog.

13
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,890
The manor is full of stray dogs these days.

14
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,030
You're scared like this because of a dog.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,610
Don't tell anyone that you know me.

16
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,370
Wait.

17
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,610
Who said I was scared of a dog?

18
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,949
When I fought against the Golden Hair Lion King,

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,870
you hadn't come here yet.

20
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,030
My good boy.

21
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,490
Who is there?

22
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,630
Who are you?

23
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,660
Are you Manager Yu?

24
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,060
Yes.

25
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,750
Miss Yu sent me to get you out.

26
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,460
Come on.

27
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Come on, please, this way.

28
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,350
This way.

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,940
Who are you?

30
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,070
Do you know him?

31
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,760
Yes.

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,860
My cousin?

33
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,090
Cousin?

34
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
Who the hell are you?

35
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,150
It's okay. I am a friend of your cousin, Yun.

36
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:10,750
My cousin?

37
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,790
What are you talking about?

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,090
Let's get out of here and then talk.

39
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,870
By then, please

40
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,110
put in a good word for me

41
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,310
in front of Yun.

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,610
Hero,

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
this can wait.

44
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,590
Our Danzhong acupoints are sealed,

45
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,430
so our martial arts are restricted.

46
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,950
Please help us unseal our acupoints first.

47
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,270
Please, this way.

48
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,230
Please.

49
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,980
Manager Yu,

50
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,750
this way.

51
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,060
Let's go.

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,580
Yu Zhao.

53
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,990
-Huo.
-I’m so exhausted.

54
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,440
Are you okay?

55
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,159
I'm fine.

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,950
I'm indestructible.

57
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,909
Wait.

58
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,690
Isn't he your cousin?

59
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,750
What cousin? I'm her lover.

60
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,470
Who are you?

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,110
Her lover?

62
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,670
Miss Yu.

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,600
Where are you going?

64
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,990
Why didn't you tell me that you came to my place?

65
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,430
I could ask Chenxing to pick you up.

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Master Ye, you're busy,

67
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,750
so I didn't want to bother you.

68
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,910
It's okay.

69
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,510
Come in and have some tea.

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,980
You go first.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,280
This is my business.

72
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,750
Miss Yu, keep my gold for me.

73
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,560
Mr. Chen, take care.

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,270
Jin Gang, let's go.

75
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,710
You can't take them by yourself.

76
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,740
We'll stay and help you.

77
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,340
Master, I'm not leaving either.

78
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Your mission is to revive the Golden Blade Sect.

79
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,350
I'll stay!

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,240
Hurry up! Go!

81
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,290
Master!

82
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,870
Go!

83
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm not leaving!

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,630
Go!

85
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,980
Master!

86
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,710
Huang.

87
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,390
Show them our kill shot!

88
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,270
Let those kids run around for a while.

89
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,050
Yes.

90
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,630
Young Master,

91
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,630
you're awake.

92
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,990
Have the people from Lu Ming Manor caught up?

93
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,920
We've been running all night.

94
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,750
I don't think they'll catch up to us soon.

95
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,980
And the horses need a rest too.

96
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,790
Hurry up. Let's continue running after we eat.

97
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,150
You must all be hungry.

98
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,390
Have some food first.

99
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,510
Then let's discuss where we should go next.

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,120
We can't go back to the Yu Mansion

101
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,870
or even Xianyun City.

102
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,090
I suppose it's full of Lu Ming Manor's men now.

103
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,760
How about...

104
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
How about you come to my home with me?

105
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,120
My father is the Mirror Commander.

106
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,190
I don't think

107
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,590
they dare do anything to us.

108
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,670
You have suffered a lot with us along the way.

109
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,190
We shouldn't bother your father.

110
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,390
Go home with Mengniang.

111
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,290
Don't suffer with us anymore.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,270
No!

113
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,740
I just want to follow you.

114
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,200
I love

115
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,370
following you.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
No one can drive me away.

117
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,390
How about...

118
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,750
Huo, let's go to your place.

119
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,670
The Two Immortals House is too far away.

120
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,060
And it's in the opposite direction.

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,790
If we go back the same way,

122
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,490
we might run into pursuers.

123
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,580
Where should we go?

124
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,790
Miss Yu.

125
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,910
Young Master Feng.

126
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,620
We meet again.

127
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,330
Did you sleep well last night?

128
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,760
Right.

129
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,170
Those three yesterday

130
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,010
were really heroes.

131
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,870
But

132
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,410
heroes usually don't end up well.

133
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,690
What did you do to them?

134
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,390
Huo.

135
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,720
Are you their disciple?

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,480
How about I send you to meet them?

137
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,830
Come on!

138
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,419
Ye Yunqing!

139
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,950
You old hag, dark from the inside out!

140
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,750
You keep haunting us.

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,590
Don't you just want that red jade?

142
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,520
Seriously.

143
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,800
What?

144
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,390
Can you become a distinguished man with that jade?

145
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,440
You won't grow any younger.

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,670
Don't you want to do some good deeds for a better next life?

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,510
Why don't you just go back and be your Chief of Sects?

148
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,470
Listen!

149
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,680
If you dare lay a finger on Yu Zhao,

150
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,710
don't blame me for being rude to you.

151
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,240
Yu Xixi, I didn't expect you to be so eloquent.

152
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,150
No wonder

153
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,710
Feng Zihe has to protect you, even if he turns into the Demon Boy.

154
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,940
It seems

155
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,080
that you are the key.

156
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,220
However,

157
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,580
who else will find out

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
if the Demon Boy dies here?

159
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,790
Archers!

160
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,850
I'll go with you.

161
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
But you have to let them go.

162
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,070
Ye Yunqing!

163
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,570
My father is the Mirror Commander of the Mirror Department.

164
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,550
If you dare lay a finger on them,

165
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,130
I'll ask my father to destroy your Lu Ming Manor.

166
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,910
Miss Liu,

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
I can guarantee your safety.

168
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,060
But you can't threaten me.

169
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,980
This is something between our adults. You kids won't understand.

170
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,610
Chenxing, come.

171
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,010
My boy.

172
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,600
I've specially prepared

173
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,080
this moment for you.

174
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,200
Go.

175
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,980
Cut off Yu Xixi's hand

176
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,990
to sever your love for her.

177
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,900
Xixi.

178
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,560
By severing your love,

179
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,920
you can achieve great things.

180
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,630
Father! Father!

181
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,550
I...

182
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,030
Chenxing.

183
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,970
You can do it.

184
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,520
Pull out your sword.

185
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,100
Pull it out!

186
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,750
Ye Chenxing.

187
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,190
I thought you were my best friend.

188
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,630
Xixi.

189
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,970
I...

190
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,350
Chop her hand off!

191
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,470
You'll be free after you chop it off!

192
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,550
Ye Chenxing!

193
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,510
Father, I can't do it!

194
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,710
If you can't, I'll help you.

195
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:03,860
Father!

196
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,550
Zihe!

197
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,030
Master!

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,840
Yu Zhao!

199
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,330
Yu Zhao.

200
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,150
Father!

201
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,850
Kill them!

202
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,680
Yes!

203
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,770
Where are they?

204
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,330
Ye Chenxing!

205
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,710
I'll kill you!

206
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,390
Enough.

207
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
You've caused so much trouble.

208
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,070
How dare you follow us?

209
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,590
Didn’t you see?

210
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,630
Our young master stabbed Master Ye.

211
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,820
That's his father.

212
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,810
And that stab saved Yu Xixi.

213
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,220
Even if we owed you before,

214
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,910
we have paid you back now.

215
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,120
How? How?

216
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,470
How can you repay my masters' lives?

217
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,640
My young master is still in a coma!

218
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,560
What about my young master?

219
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:33,870
All right.

220
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,780
He can no longer return to Lu Ming Manor.

221
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,700
Besides,

222
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,870
Master Ye did all of this.

223
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,130
My young master was compelled.

224
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,240
No, get lost!

225
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,790
Get lost!

226
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,360
Xixi.

227
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,310
Xixi.

228
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,040
Say no more.

229
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,210
I'm very grateful that you stabbed your father.

230
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,550
You can stay if you want.

231
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,050
But I want you to know.

232
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,420
I hate you.

233
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,070
We're done.

234
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,990
Xixi.

235
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,900
Thank you for saving us.

236
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,830
Please take off your mask

237
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,070
so I can thank you face-to-face.

238
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,470
Hero, what do you mean by that?

239
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,640
Who the hell are you?

240
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,030
Did Ye Yunqing send you here?

241
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,710
You can't speak?

242
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,930
Where did you come from?

243
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,630
Have you been spying on us all along?

244
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,760
If I'm not mistaken,

245
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,710
what you just used

246
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,440
is the long-lost Fire Thunder,

247
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,510
a unique skill of Yixiao Hall.

248
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,820
Yixiao Hall?

249
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,860
Cut the crap!

250
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,670
Let's go together

251
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,510
and remove his mask!

252
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,280
All right.

253
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,400
Stop! Stop!

254
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,240
What's that!

255
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,270
Well...

256
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,670
Uncle San?

257
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,600
Miss.

258
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,670
I...

259
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,390
Uncle San?

260
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,070
How come it's you?

261
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,870
If I say

262
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,510
that I was just passing by,

263
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,140
will you buy it?

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,850
So,

265
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,520
when you were young, you were a disciple of the Yixiao Hall

266
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,680
and learned secret weapon techniques and business skills there.

267
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,520
I primarily learned about business.

268
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,810
Secret weapons were acquired along the way.

269
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,940
After all, I need to be able to protect myself

270
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,890
when I do business.

271
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,080
But it's a shame

272
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,360
that I wasn't born to do business.

273
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,040
Thanks to Her Ladyship,

274
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,190
I can work in the Yu family.

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,430
You learned secret weapons along the way.

276
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,330
You can save us from Ye Yunqing.

277
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,790
Mastering it isn't something that easy.

278
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,350
Total fluke.

279
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,890
It must be that I caught Ye Yunqing off guard,

280
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,700
so I took advantage of it.

281
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,140
Take advantage of it?

282
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,160
We just fought against you together,

283
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,600
but you still managed to gain the upper hand.

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,380
Is that a fluke too?

285
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,190
You're all tired from the running,

286
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,900
and you are all injured.

287
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,390
Of course, you can't exert your full strength.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,360
By the way, Uncle San,

289
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,630
why didn't you stay at Yu Mansion

290
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,590
but come to us?

291
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,090
Miss.

292
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,600
After you left,

293
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,370
the men from Lu Ming Manor came back.

294
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,750
It seems that they are searching for something

295
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
in our mansion and Zhao Xi Restaurant.

296
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,470
Looking for something?

297
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,870
For what?

298
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,010
Master.

299
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,670
Speak.

300
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,510
We lost Feng Zihe and the others.

301
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,390
Don't worry.

302
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,350
We're still searching.

303
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,670
We will...

304
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,350
No need.

305
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,110
Leave some people to keep searching.

306
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,349
The rest of you, go back to the manor.

307
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,490
But, Young Master and the others...

308
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,200
Yes, I understand.

309
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,579
I'll arrange it right away.

310
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,180
Tomorrow,

311
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,660
I have an important task for you.

312
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,710
Please tell me.

313
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,910
Chenxing

314
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,110
still has feelings for Yu Xixi.

315
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,000
Young Master...

316
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,870
Do you know why

317
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,470
I only chased after Yu Xixi but didn't catch her?

318
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,150
I don’t know.

319
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,810
All along,

320
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,750
someone has been following us.

321
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,570
What?

322
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,870
I'll take him down now.

323
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,390
No.

324
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,030
This will only alert him.

325
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,310
I believe

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,680
this man must know

327
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,950
the secret of Yu Xixi.

328
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,800
So, you mean...

329
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,210
Tomorrow,

330
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,310
I will corner Yu Xixi to the dead end.

331
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,580
The person who has been following us

332
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,910
will definitely show up and save her.

333
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,420
We'll intentionally make a mistake

334
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
and let them go.

335
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,230
I believe

336
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,150
the secret I want to know

337
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,340
is hidden in the place they want to go.

338
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,210
You mean

339
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,550
you want me to lead a group of men

340
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,760
to secretly follow

341
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,540
and find their hiding place?

342
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,430
Not good enough.

343
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Please enlighten me.

344
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,430
Tomorrow,

345
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,190
I will keep pushing Chenxing to harm Yu Xixi.

346
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,720
When Chenxing can't take it any longer,

347
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,710
I'll push him to betray me.

348
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,280
In the chaos,

349
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,990
he can only go with Yu Xixi and the others.

350
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,280
You can use it to stay by Yu Xixi's side

351
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,650
to help me uncover the mystery.

352
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,220
But

353
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,960
after all that we have done,

354
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,080
will Yu Xixi still accept us?

355
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,640
Don't worry.

356
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,550
Yu Xixi and the others are just like Chenxing.

357
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,910
They are too sentimental.

358
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,070
It's taboo to achieve great things.

359
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,620
Are you sure

360
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,920
that the Young Master will save Yu Xixi and the others?

361
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,710
He is my son.

362
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,440
I know him too well.

363
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,590
What if the man who has been following us

364
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,390
didn't show up to save them?

365
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,830
It doesn't matter.

366
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,110
I can always find an excuse

367
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,820
to let them escape.

368
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,790
The man who should show up

369
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,630
will show up sooner or later.

370
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,730
It's always good for us

371
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,760
to let you stay with Yu Xixi sooner.

372
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,790
Take this with you.

373
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,190
This is...

374
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,750
This is the carrier pigeon that I carefully raised.

375
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,140
When you come to Yu Xixi's hiding place,

376
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,010
keep in touch with me.

377
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,920
Yes.

378
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,610
Also,

379
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,360
the note can't be tied to the pigeon's legs.

380
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,180
It's very easy to be noticed.

381
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,910
Then what should I do?

382
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,570
The paper is specially made.

383
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,430
You can feed the paper to the pigeon.

384
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,750
When the pigeon flies back,

385
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,390
I can get the paper

386
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,710
from its stomach.

387
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,270
Yes.

388
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,110
After this,

389
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,860
I'll take you as my adopted son.

390
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,510
You have great martial arts skills.

391
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,240
You have a bright future.

392
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,410
Yu Zhao, you're awake.

393
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,840
-Master.
-Zihe.

394
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,630
You're awake.

395
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,570
Young Master.

396
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,470
Yu Zhao, what's wrong with your eyes?

397
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,870
Nothing.

398
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,670
Hit him!

399
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,560
Nothing?

400
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,240
That's weird.

401
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,930
Uncle San, take a look at him and see

402
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,430
if there is something wrong that we don't know about.

403
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,750
His pulse is stable.

404
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,310
He's fine now.

405
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,760
Well...

406
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,230
Your hand...

407
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,750
Why is your hand so pale?

408
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,190
What's going on?

409
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,710
Let me check it out.

410
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,830
No need.

411
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,650
Uncle San, really, no need.

412
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,630
Well,

413
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,270
Yu Xixi fell asleep on this hand.

414
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,750
Well...

415
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,830
Be gentle.

416
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,720
He hasn’t fully recovered yet.

417
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,840
Go.

418
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,770
Zihe!

419
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,630
Why is Ye Chenxing here?

420
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,810
He can't go back to Lu Ming Manor.

421
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,070
He stabbed his father

422
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,730
and saved us all.

423
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,020
He stabbed his father?

424
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,570
Don't worry too much.

425
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,590
You fell into a coma for so long.

426
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,350
I was worried sick.

427
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:18,990
I'm fine now.

428
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,160
By the way,

429
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,350
how did you find me?

430
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,330
You knew about it?

431
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,040
Jin Gang told me all about your dirty tricks.

432
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,750
I wondered why you could always find me,

433
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,430
no matter where I went before.

434
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,510
I did it for your own good.

435
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,230
I don't care.

436
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,620
It's mine.

437
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:45,800
Okay.

438
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,740
Then...

439
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,070
What about the marriage contract?

440
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,600
Marriage contract?

441
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,470
What marriage contract?

442
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,260
The paper I gave you when I left that day.

443
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,820
That one?

444
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,110
I lost it.

445
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,960
Lost it?

446
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,320
Of course.

447
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,330
You have no idea

448
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,750
how much hardship we went through to save you.

449
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,280
It's normal to lose something.

450
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,710
Are you sure that you lost it?

451
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,280
Are you sure

452
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,070
it won't suddenly reappear?

453
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,190
I'm sure.

454
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,170
I'm relieved then.

455
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,160
If it's lost,

456
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,870
should

457
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,700
we...

458
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,390
It hurts.

459
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,810
-I'm sorry.
-It hurts.

460
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,720
Are you alright?

461
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
What are you doing?

462
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,630
Why are you sneaking around in the middle of the night?

463
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,300
Feeding the horses. Is there anything wrong with that?

464
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,070
Feeding horses?

465
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,030
You even brought the fodder?

466
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,550
My horses only eat this type of fodder.

467
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,470
It's really fodder.
