49
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,710
why did you suddenly want to buy all the distiller's yeast in the city?

50
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,980
Because Xixi wants to make wine.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,470
So you spent so much money on the distiller's yeast?

52

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,500
she and Ye Chenxing came out together.

194
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,510
Together?

195
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,630
Where did they go then?

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
To the Jianghu Public House.

197
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,630
Let's go there.

198
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,390
But your schedule is full today.

199
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,280
Mr. Wang will be here soon.

200
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,150
Here comes Mr. Wang

201
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,560
Here he is.

202
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,910
Go and keep an eye on them. I'll be there later.

203
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,210
Okay.

204
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,870
Come in, please.

205
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
This is the Jianghu Public House.

206
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,780
Welcome.

207
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,400
This is...

208
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,960
This is Young Master Ye of Lu Ming Manor.

209
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,670
Young Master Ye.

210
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,830
This is...

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,190
She is my best friend, Li Yun.

212
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,350
Nice to meet you, Young Master Ye.

213
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,230
Nice to meet you too.

214
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,559
Have a seat.

215
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,039
Please.

216
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,460
Xixi. Menu.

217
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,549
Your restaurant has a unique style.

218
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,300
Of course.

219
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,790
Thank you.

220
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,760
Your dishes are interesting.

221
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,120
Are you sure these are dishes?

222
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,180
The best twin.

224
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,070
Fish head with two kinds of chillies.

225
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,750
Shoot through the heart with one arrow.

226
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,650
Roasted chicken heart skewers.

227
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,670
Green Dragon Laying on Snow.

228
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,010
Cucumbers with white sugar.

229
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,470
Am I right, Miss Xixi?

230
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,820
You are smart, Young Master Ye.

231
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,530
You are flattering me.

232
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,870
By the way,

233
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,770
what do you want me to do?

234
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,190
Actually,

235
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,640
I want to cooperate with you.

236
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,990
I hope you can help advertise our restaurant

237
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,930
as you a high social status.

238
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,830
No problem.

239
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,330
Since you asked me for help,

240
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,270
I will definitely do it for you.

241
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,630
From now on,

242
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,610
I will come here every day.

243
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,910
Not only me,

244
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,390
every one of the Lu Ming Manor

245
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,700
will come to the tavern.

246
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,110
Really?

247
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,730
Yeah.

248
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,990
And then

249
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,360
What's wrong with his throat.

250
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,720
It's fine. I'll treat him.

251
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,910
Mo, do you still want to redeem your sword?

252
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,770
It's fine.

253
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,480
Let's celebrate with a bottle of wine.

254
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,520
OK. Xiang, go get the wine.

255
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,950
Go.

256
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,240
Come on.

257
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,870
Come on.

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,550
Thank you.

259
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,030
Take it.

260
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Cheers for our cooperation.

261
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,160
Cheers! Cheers!

OK. Manager Yu, you can be assured.

Our troupe

282
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,860
will let the best performers

283
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,990
perform at the Huixian Restaurant.

284
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,970
OK. I’m leaving.

285
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,320
Goodbye, Mr. Zhao.

286
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,830
Guards, see Mr. Zhao off.

287
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,910
Mr. Zhao, please.

288
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,140
Which table ordered this dish?

289
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,220
The second table upstairs.

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,670
Here are all the dishes you ordered.

291
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,270
Manager Yu comes.

292
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
Serve the dishes.

293
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,630
Did we come to the wrong place?

294
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,950
No.

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm sure it is Jianghu Public House.

296
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,590
Okay, right away.

297
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,720
Well...

298
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,200
It's for work. For work.

299
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,110
I'm a little busy today.

300
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,380
Have a seat.

301
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Xiang, take Young Master to have a seat.

302
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,110
Coming.

303
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,990
Young Master, this way please.

304
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,530
Young Master.

305
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,120
Young Master, this way please.

306
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,620
Music!

307
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,990
Sorry, Young Master,

308
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,770
there are too many people today,

309
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,850
there's no empty table.

310
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,970
So you have to share a table with Young Master Ye.

311
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,930
Mr. Yu, nice to meet you.

312
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,840
Xixi is a cute girl.

313
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,150
What did you call her?

314
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,390
Xixi.

315
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,700
How dare you call her like that?

316
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,710
He who comes is surely ill-intentioned.

317
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,570
Mo, go up and have a sword dance

318
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,680
to cheer everyone up.

319
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,740
I...

320
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,330
Do you want to redeem your sword?

321
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,080
Okay.

322
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,780
Jin Gang, dance with me.

323
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,190
Yes, sir!

324
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,310
OK.

325
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,150
Young Master Ye,

326
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,020
I heard you were frightened by a cat a few days ago.

327
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,340
It didn't leave you traumatized, did it?

328
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,460
It is said that Young Master Ye

329
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,540
rushed out in a terrible state.

330
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,000
You might be embarrassed.

331
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,010
Thank you for your concern.

332
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,280
But thanks to the assassin,

333
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,730
I could meet Xixi.

334
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,350
By the way, Mr. Yu,

335
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,630
I heard that Xixi broke up with you

336
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,820
on the night of the wedding.

337
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,330
It is said that...

338
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,480
It's just a rumor.

339
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,750
It's not trustworthy.

340
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,560
Xixi and I didn't break off our engagement.

341
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,290
We just postponed it.

342
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,280
Then why you postponed the engagement?

343
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,020
Is there a reason?

344
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,270
I respect Xixi's opinion.

345
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,300
Respect her opinion?

346
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,510
No problem.

347
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,470
I know some good doctors.

348
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,470
If you need to see a doctor,

349
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,910
I can introduce them to you.

350
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,480
I promise you will be cured.

351
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Bravo! Bravo!

352
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,590
Excellent!

353
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,570
I didn't expect Young Master Ye

354
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,880
would believe those rumors.

355
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,990
How ridiculous.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,930
You're straightforward.

357
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,480
I like it.

358
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
However,

359
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,910
you think the engagement is postponed,

360
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,590
does Xixi

361
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,880
think so, too?

362
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,890
Are you okay?

363
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,420
OK.

364
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,000
Mr. Yu,

365
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,520
I don't know

366
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,450
if I should tell you one thing.

367
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,150
Go ahead.

368
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,390
Xixi told me

369
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,780
Mr. Yu

370
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,880
is an arrogant,

371
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,450
conceited

372
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,450
and narcissistic man.

373
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,150
She said she wouldn't marry you

374
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,840
even if she died.

375
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,840
Bravo!

376
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,130
Ye Chenxing!

377
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,630
Bravo!

378
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,450
Bravo!

379
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,310
I suggest everyone here toast Yu Xixi,

380
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,069
the owner of the Jianghu Public House.

381
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,220
Wait.

382
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,640
I suggest we

383
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,150
toast Young Master Ye

384
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,020
to thank him for everything he did for the tavern.

385
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,870
Love shot!

386
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,080
Love shot! Love shot!

387
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,750
Love shot! Love shot!

388
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,630
Love shot! Love shot!

389
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,590
Love shot! Love shot!

390
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,510
Love shot! Love shot!

391
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,070
What's going on?

392
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,550
Love shot! Love shot!

393
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,340
Love shot! Love shot!

394
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,280
Love shot! Love shot!

395
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,240
Love shot! Love shot!

396
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,200
Love shot! Love shot!

397
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,040
Love shot! Love shot!

398
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:34,600
♫We dance all night♫

399
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,030
Yu Zhao!

400
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,920
You are the boss of the Huixian Restaurant.

401
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Why do you keep pestering me?

402
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:43,110
♫Midnight is the saddest time♫

403
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,870
Come back and make it clear.

404
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:52,020
♫All the splendor of life is gone in an instant♫

405
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,040
♫But the flowing water doesn't understand my feeling♫

406
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,530
♫There is nowhere for me to express my miss♫

407
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,200
♫I wish you and me are like the moon and the star♫

408
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,430
Do you want to explain to her?

409
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,350
How?

410
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,740
♫Which can dance together all night♫

411
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,100
Xixi,

412
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,020
I kissed you because I like you.

413
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,290
No, no.

414
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,530
It's embarrassing.

415
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,750
Yu Zhao!

416
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,350
You are the boss of the Huixian Restaurant.

417
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,810
Why do you keep pestering me?

418
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,540
Because marrying you

419
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,780
is the most important thing.

420
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:35,960
Xiang,

421
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,010
do you think Yu Zhao was a bit strange today?

422
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,140
Miss, you don't understand.

423
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,220
Young Master is jealous.

424
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,500
Why?

425
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,160
He is jealous of Young Master Ye.

426
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,440
Why is he jealous of Ye Chenxing?

427
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,910
We're just good friends.

428
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,760
And I have nothing to do with him.

429
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Why is he jealous?

430
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,820
I think

431
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,200
Young Master really likes you.

432
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,380
Stop it.

433
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,510
He was just showing off to Ye Chenxing today.

434
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,470
Miss,

435
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,260
stop lying to yourself.

436
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,790
Think it over.

437
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,350
Think about it.

438
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,000
How did you feel

439
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,030
when Young Master kissed you?

440
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,030
My heart is racing.

441
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
That's right.

442
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,470
It is said that

443
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
only the moment

444
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,830
when the person you like kisses you,

445
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,540
your heart will beat faster.

446
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,350
How did you know?

447
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,680
I read it from novels.

448
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,150
Stop reading novels.

449
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,520
You've learned something bad.

450
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,080
Only when the person I love kisses me, my heart will beat faster?

451
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,640
Seeing this sword is like seeing the Master.

452
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,600
You brought us back.

453
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,260
Did my father come out?

454
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,810
Master was very angry

455
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,070
that you left the manor without permission.

456
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,740
Shadow,

457
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,790
please listen to my explanation.

458
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
Young Master went there

459
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,300
for the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

460
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,630
We've already arranged people

461
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,940
in every shop, hotel, and theater

462
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,700
in the Xianyun City

463
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,210
to find out where the Red Jade of Cangqiong is.

464
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
He did so

465
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,800
with the intention of helping the Master.

466
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,110
Am I right, Young Master?

467
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,650
Yes.

468
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,190
Anyway,

469
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,150
it's your fault that you left the villa without permission.

470
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,550
You two

471
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,760
should reflect on yourselves in the secret room.

472
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,350
The Master will decide

473
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,910
how to punish you

474
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,930
after he comes out.

475
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,240
Young Master, bad news!

476
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:03,700
Say it.

477
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,320
There is a fight in the Jianghu Public House!

478
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,850
Who?

479
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,760
I don't know.

480
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,150
It's a mess.

481
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,630
How's Yu Xixi?

482
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
There are too many people. I didn't see her.

483
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,780
Call all the servants of the Yu family

484
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,470
to come with me.

485
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:15,990
Yes.

486
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,160
Manager Yu.

487
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,350
Where is Yu Xixi?

488
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,070
Xi.

489
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,810
She's...

490
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,950
Here.

491
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,890
Miss Liu, are you alright?

492
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,660
Is anyone hurt?

493
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,440
Some injured have been sent to the hospital.

494
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,190
Where is Xiang?

495
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,310
Xiang.

496
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,430
Uncle, I'm here.

497
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
Xianaxiang, are you okay?

498
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,590
I'm fine.

499
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,550
What happened?

500
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,130
It's a huge loss.

501
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,600
Look.

502
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,670
There's a bench.

503
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,330
What happened?

504
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,070
It's...

505
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,450
Junior,

506
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,260
I didn't expect to see you here today.

507
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,420
You hurt our master and betrayed us.

508
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,740
You should go back with me and apologize.

509
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,960
Senior,

510
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,660
I've long broken off with our master.

511
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,230
Why do you keep pestering me?

512
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,790
In that case,

513
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,740
junior, show me your sword.

514
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,630
I've always wanted to compete with you.

515
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,990
Stop. We should have peace and love.

516
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,150
We should bury the hatchet.

517
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,310
Listen to me. Don't fight.

518
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,220
Happiness brings sorrow.

519
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,630
Is this the correct way to do business?

520
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,230
Those men are punks.

521
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Look how messy this place is.

522
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,960
It was an emergency.

523
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,670
Emergency?

524
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,770
All coincidences are inevitable.

525
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,000
In my opinion,

526
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,280
you should stay away from Ye Chenxing.

527
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,070
Without him,

528
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,710
would the tavern be like this?

529
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,590
I'll take responsibility.

530
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,300
You?

531
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,280
How?

532
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,720
How?

533
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,990
Uncle,

534
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,030
have you done the calculation?

535
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,200
Young Master,

536
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,590
around 70% of the tables and tableware

537
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,650
are destroyed.

538
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,860
If we buy new ones,

539
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,850
it will cost about 50 taels.

540
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,000
50 taels?

541
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,450
And the medical bills

542
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,190
of the injured customers

543
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,470
are about 50 taels in total.

544
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,640
Another 50 taels?

545
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,190
Subtract the profit earned past days,

546
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,750
the tavern lost 85 taels.

547
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,840
Seriously?

548
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,910
I worked so hard,

549
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,690
but now I owe so much money?

550
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,280
So...

551
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,230
So...

552
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,230
Just give up.

553
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,670
Go back with me and prepare for the wedding.

554
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,040
No.

555
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,590
Give me another chance.

556
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,520
I can make it.

557
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,420
Okay.

558
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,010
I'll wait.

559
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,230
Manager Yu.

560
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,020
Let's go.
