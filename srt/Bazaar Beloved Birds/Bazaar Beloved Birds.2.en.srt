[Episode 2]

4
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,590
How about we unveil the cover now?

5
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,789
Wait.

6
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
I haven't decided yet.

7
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,370
At this point, what are you thinking about?

8
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,110
Now is the time to think even more.

9
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,160
I won't marry you.

10
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,550
What?

11
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,380
I've had enough of you.

12
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,400
Everything has to be done according to your will.

13
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,750
After Mother's death,

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,430
it has become more critical.

15
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,430
What else can I do?

16
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,240
Letting you have your way?

17
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,180
What's wrong with letting me have my way?

18
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,990
I am a living person,

19
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,360
and of course, I have my own thoughts.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,150
Moreover, I don't even know

21
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,230
who my biological parents are.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,850
In the Yu Mansion, I am just a dependent.

23
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,720
Now I have to marry you in this way.

24
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,310
Have you considered my feelings?

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,590
Your feelings?

26
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,940
Then tell me.

27
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,410
I want to study mechanical arts.

28
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,440
I feel that it's related to my identity.

29
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,550
It's all your imagination.

30
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,670
Besides, as a young lady,

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,150
you expose yourself too much, and if word gets out...

32
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,190
Must a young lady always be gentle and agreeable?

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,810
Besides, I don't want to marry someone

34
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,650
I don't love.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Parental arrangements are someone else's rules,

36
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,160
not mine.

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Wait.

38
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,910
What?

39
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,160
Before Mother passed away, she wanted me to marry you

40
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,730
because she was concerned about your future

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,100
and wanted me to take care of you.

42
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,810
You have to prove to me

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,630
that you can take care of yourself.

44
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,100
So that

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,530
I can fulfill my promise to Mother.

46
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,990
How do you want me to prove it?

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,020
It's up to you. I'll follow your lead.

48
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,670
How about this?

49
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,030
In 3 months,

50
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,630
if I can earn enough money,

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,970
the engagement will be completely canceled.

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,840
And if you don't earn enough?

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,579
Then we get married, and I'll be devoted to you.

54
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,190
Earning money is too easy.

55
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,090
Even a single copper coin counts as earnings.

56
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,310
Let's set a target.

57
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,110
How much do you want to set?

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,470
Your monthly expenses,

59
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,030
including all the miscellaneous things,

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,590
are at least 50 taels.

61
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,270
So, for 3 months, it's at least 150 taels.

62
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,350
I'll cut you some slack

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,060
and make it 100 taels for 3 months.

64
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,430
100 taels.

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,700
100 taels?

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,079
How about 80 taels?

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,110
150 taels.

68
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,640
100 taels. Deal.

69
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,350
It's a deal.

Not at all.

99
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,660
Young Master, you still look handsome as ever.

100
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,590
Why do they all look at me strangely?

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
This seat is taken.

102
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,400
Young Master,

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,470
you have a hidden ailment, don't you?

104
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,100
I understand.

105
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,960
The top-quality Autumn Stone.

106
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,440
You only need 3 taels of it per day,

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,790
taken with spring water,

108
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,430
which guarantees your vitality.

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,310
This box lasts for 3 months,

110
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,630
for only fifteen taels of silver.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,310
What nonsense is this?

112
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,260
Jin Gang, get rid of him.

113
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,550
Stop talking nonsense here.

114
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,340
Hurry up and leave.

115
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,470
The price is negotiable.

116
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,950
Leave!

117
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,550
It can ensure your vitality and rejuvenate your vigor!

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,880
What a lunatic.

119
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,030
Jin Gang, go and inquire,

120
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,290
find out what's really going on.

121
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,840
Okay.

122
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,080
Tell me.

123
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,990
I dare not.

124
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,760
Miss spread rumors in the city that you're having "man's problems."

125
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,510
That's why she called off the engagement.

126
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,870
I...

127
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,700
My reputation in Xianyun City

128
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,340
has been ruined by that Yu Xixi.

129
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,520
Young Master,

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,510
in my opinion,

131
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,790
don't take this matter too seriously.

132
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,990
After all, you indulged Miss in her whims back then.

133
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,550
I just had a disagreement with her, and it reached that point.

134
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,340
Then you can't blame others for this.

135
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,150
How about this?

136
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,830
I'll send the servants out

137
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,640
to clarify it for you.

138
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,790
Yes, Young Master.

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,310
I think Uncle San is right.

140
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,690
We'll go out and spread the word,

141
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,750
let everyone know that you're in good health.

142
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,390
Where is Yu Xixi?

143
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,070
Miss

144
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
went out early in the morning with Xiang,

145
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,310
saying she went to make money.

146
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,180
Make money?

147
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,630
You seem a bit strange today.

148
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,140
How come you have time to invite me out for a stroll in the daytime?

149
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,750
What's the matter? Spit it out.

150
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,820
You've heard about me and Yu Zhao, right?

151
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,890
Of course.

152
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,020
The whole Xianyun City knows.

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,620
Really?

154
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,720
What did they say? Tell me quickly.

155
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,760
Let's not talk about that.

156
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,200
Just tell me what's the matter.

157
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,420
Here's the thing.

158
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,610
I made a bet with Yu Zhao

159
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,030
that I could earn 100 taels in 3 months.

160
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,390
I've been looking for opportunities all morning.

161
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,190
But no one wants to hire me.

162
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,950
So, talk to your father for me

163
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,510
and let me work at your Li Mansion.

164
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,580
The monthly pay doesn't have to be high,

165
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,650
just give me 35 taels a month.

166
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,520
You two can continue your stroll.

167
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,380
I'll head back first.

168
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,280
By the way,

169
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,070
in the future, don't contact me unless necessary.

170
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,700
Are you my sister? Do you have any loyalty?

171
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,950
No, I'm not your sister. I have no loyalty.

172
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
My father, you know what kind of person he is,

173
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,530
calculative and stingy.

174
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,860
It's better to ask for his life

175
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,270
than asking him for 35 taels per month.

176
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,490
I really have something to do, excuse me.

177
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,190
Miss,

178
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,110
what should we do now?

179
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,210
It's okay.

180
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,950
Let's continue to find work.

181
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,320
I don't believe that with my wit,

182
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,380
I can't make money.

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Let's go.

184
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,680
Manager, do you have any jobs

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,780
where there's little work but a lot of money?

186
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,710
Yes.

187
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,990
Is there such a good thing?

188
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,260
If you know where it is,

189
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,730
don't forget to take me with you.

190
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,870
What kind of work do you have here?

191
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,210
Waitress, 10 taels a month.

192
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,890
That's too little.

193
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,100
What about her?

194
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,100
Five taels.

195
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,010
Why is my salary so low?

196
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,390
Deal.

197
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,870
Manager, Manager.

198
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,790
Hold on.

199
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,380
What is it?

200
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,030
Manager, haven't you heard?

201
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,800
Any merchant who hires Yu Xixi

202
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,870
can no longer do business with the Yu family.

203
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,240
We can't afford to provoke the Yu family.

204
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,750
I'd better find a reason

205
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,840
to send her away.

206
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,240
Miss, what should we do?

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,290
Just now, from what the manager said,

208
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,480
it seems that no one in Xianyun City dares to hire us.

209
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,360
But let's not get discouraged.

210
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,660
Xianyun City has 72 restaurants.

211
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,910
Apart from Huixian Restaurant,

212
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,060
there are...

213
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,310
There are still 45 others.

214
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,870
Let's quickly go to the next one.

215
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,990
What's the use of looking?

216
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,360
We've been played by Yu Zhao.

217
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,310
Let's go find him.

218
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,820
Miss...

219
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,310
Yu Zhao, you're bullying me!

220
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,030
Miss,

221
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,390
who are you angry with?

222
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,170
All right, let's eat.

223
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,920
Is it you who's been making moves behind my back?

224
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,810
We had an agreement.

225
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,710
Stop eating!

226
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,540
I did spread some words.

227
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,470
So what?

228
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
So what?

229
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,470
How am I supposed to make money?

230
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,060
No one in Xianyun City dares to hire me.

231
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,370
I did it for the good of the Yu family.

232
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,440
How can the distinguished Miss Yu

233
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,010
work for others? That's inappropriate.

234
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,080
Besides,

235
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,600
even if I hadn't say anything,

236
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,430
do you think anyone would dare to hire you?

237
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,310
But it is not good to play dirty tricks behind my back.

238
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,470
You just made a bet.

239
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,780
And now you are going to give it up?

240
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,350
You...

241
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,110
What's that look?

242
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,190
What do you mean?

243
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,080
I have a way to make money.

244
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,030
Do you want to hear it?

245
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,670
What is it?

246
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,110
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

247
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,670
Come, sit.

248
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,320
Let me feed you.

249
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,360
Why do you want to feed me?

250
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,110
As long as you obediently let me feed you,

251
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,760
I will tell you a way to make money.

252
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,630
This is so embarrassing.

253
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,700
What should I do with so many people watching me?

254
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,270
Oh my god.

255
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,410
Why does Yu Zhao look like a completely different person today?

256
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,740
Here, your favorite crab soup.

257
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,070
Good for you, Yu Xixi, dare to spread rumors about me outside.

258
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,840
I'll let you experience how it feels.

259
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,270
It's so awkward.

260
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,390
I really want to find a place to hide.

261
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,000
No, I have to find a way.

262
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,030
Yu Zhao, wait and see.

263
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,300
Let me wipe it off.

264
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,990
Oh, my. What a coincidence!

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,630
Coming.

372
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,940
Here's the wine.

373
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,160
How is it? Is it good?

374
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,190
Not bad.

375
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,100
I knew it.

376
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,920
What's the name of this wine?

377
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,280
Crest of a crane.

378
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,610
Why are you wasting it?

379
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,470
Do you want me to die?

380
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,290
What?

381
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,320
Crest of a crane.

382
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,920
You misunderstood.

383
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,130
Where does the name 'Daughter Red' come from?

384
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,140
It's the wine for a daughter's wedding.

385
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,560
What about Top Scholar Red?

386
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,230
It's the wine for when someone becomes the top scholar.

387
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,330
What about Crest of a crane?

388
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,840
It's the wine for when you want to kill someone.

389
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,280
You're so foolish.

390
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,440
Crest of a crane is the wine you drink

391
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,330
to celebrate when someone reaches the peak.

392
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,720
The characters were written wrong.

393
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,370
Yun!

394
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,960
I'm sorry, we wrote the characters wrong.

395
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,530
Sorry.

396
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,600
Master, Young Master Ye took the opportunity to slip away while you were in seclusion.

397
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,500
Unfilial son!

398
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,860
Go catch him and bring him back.

399
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,020
I will handle this when I come out of seclusion.

400
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,810
Yes, I will take care of it right away.

401
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,880
How is the thing I asked you to find?

402
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,580
There's no lead yet.

403
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,190
but I've arranged for informants to go to Xianyun City.

404
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,330
It's such a waste.

405
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,440
It's alright.

406
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,350
Miss, there's a new young master in Xianyun City.

407
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,390
There he is!

408
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,670
There he is!

409
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,110
He is very ethereal, isn't he?

410
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,310
As they say in the stories?

411
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:19,980
Look.

412
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,150
So handsome.

413
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,750
Young Master,

414
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,580
where did you get the money to hire so many swordsmen?

415
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,040
I pawned your sword.

416
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,600
What?

417
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,180
This is outrageous!

418
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,070
Apart from hiring these swordsmen,

419
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,020
I also rented a big mansion.

420
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,120
There's still a lot of money left.

421
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,380
Unexpectedly,

422
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,120
your sword is quite valuable.

423
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,150
Young Master,

424
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,800
that's a thousand-year-old mysterious iron.

425
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,660
Enough.

426
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,060
Mysterious iron is still iron, isn't it?

427
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,490
When I make enough money, I'll redeem it for you.

428
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,880
Assassin!

429
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,020
Assassin?

430
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,750
What assassin?

431
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,060
Protect Young Master!

432
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,470
Mo.

433
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,450
I'll blend into the crowd first.

434
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
You must catch the assassin.

435
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,550
Take care of yourself.

436
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,420
I have faith in you.

437
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,070
Young Master!

438
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,150
Assassin!

439
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,160
Where is the assassin?

440
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,590
Assassin? What assassin?

441
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,060
Didn't you just shout about an assassin?

442
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,710
What?

443
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,460
I was shouting for Fourth Brother.

444
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,910
It's my cat's name.

445
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,360
It just got lost.

446
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,360
Assassin.

447
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,060
Assassin.

448
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,340
What is the assassin doing there?

449
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,990
Let's go.

450
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,730
Are cat names this domineering nowadays?

451
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,330
Fourth Brother.

452
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,460
How dare you be an assassin?

453
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,570
How dare you be an assassin?

454
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,510
I'll beat you to death!

455
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,130
Stop!

456
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:07,870
I'll beat you to death!

457
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
Miss, come on!

458
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,150
Help!

459
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,320
Miss, you're amazing.

460
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,120
Let's see if you dare to do it again.

461
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,590
Beat him! Miss, you're amazing!

462
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,110
I'll beat you to death!

463
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,980
Help me!

464
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,630
-Miss, you’re amazing!
-Stop!

465
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,410
Hero, don’t worry.

466
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,600
I have subdued him for you.

467
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,730
No, you misunderstood.

468
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,640
It was him.

469
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,290
Young Master, are you alright?

470
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,110
Young Master?

471
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,840
It's you.

472
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,290
Have we met before?

473
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,030
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,970
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,550
Who are you? How dare you attack our Young Master?

476
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,160
No, I misunderstood.

477
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,240
Knife.

478
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,500
Watch out. Watch out.

479
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,150
Tell me.

480
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,570
Who sent you here?

481
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,900
Say something.

482
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,220
It's a misunderstanding, Mo Mo.

483
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,090
Put down the sword.

484
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,640
No.

485
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,750
I must be responsible for the young master's safety.

486
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,150
As a Young Master, you...

487
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,910
Give me some face.

488
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,340
I must be responsible for the Master.

489
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,470
No suspicious individuals can be let go.

490
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,480
He is so loyal to me.

491
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,660
There's really no other choice.

492
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,610
Wealth?

493
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,510
Let her go!

494
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,510
Who are you?

495
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,640
You'd be scared if I told you.

496
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
He's Yu Zhao, the manager of Huixian Restaurant.

497
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,580
Manager Yu.

498
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,490
Manager Yu, nice to meet you.

499
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,820
I'm Ye Chenxing,

500
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
the Young Master of Lu Ming Manor.

501
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,080
I just arrived in Xianyun City today. I hope you...

502
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,740
Let her go.

503
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,240
You!

504
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,270
What?

505
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,550
Do you believe

506
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,530
I will let your Young Master be pierced by an arrow today?

507
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,790
Xixi.

508
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,890
Sister Xiang.

509
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,240
Xixi. Interesting.
