00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,190
Young Master,

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,430
we received a letter from the Hangcheng branch.

6
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,350
It says there's a problem.

7
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,780
So you need to go there tomorrow.

8
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:10,990
Tomorrow?

9
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,750
Yes.

10
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,690
Mr. Zhao from Hangcheng branch said

11
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,750
it was quite urgent.

12
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,480
You need to handle it in person.

13
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,790
OK.

14
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,400
Hangcheng is not far.

15
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:22,990
Jin Gang.

16
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,160
Go with me tomorrow morning.

17
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,160
We'll be back soon.

18
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,090
Yes, Young Master.

19
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,350
By the way, Yu Xixi,

20
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,810
you went to Ye Chenxing yesterday

21
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,680
without my permission.

22
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,390
You two also had some physical contact in public.

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,490
How should we settle this?

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,460
What do you mean?

25
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,190
What about the thing you did?

26
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,079
What are you referring to?

27
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,810
The carriage.

28
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,430
The carriage?

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,710
Young Master.

30
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,330
Are you alright?

31
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm fine.

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,580
Why are you blushing?

33
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,210
It's hot here.

34
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,070
Are you sure?

35
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,079
It's in the first lunar month yet.

36
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,960
How can it be hot?

37
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,670
Do you feel hot?

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,690
No.

39
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,870
I might be cold then.

40
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,579
I'm full.

41
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,920
I'll go back to my room.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
Jin Gang, let's go.

43
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,630
By the way,

44
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,190
I'll punish you for meeting Ye Chenxing without permission yesterday.

45
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,240
From now on,

46
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,110
you can't go anywhere.

47
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,620
But it's the Lantern Festival tomorrow.

48
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,730
Just because it's the Lantern Festival,

49
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,910
you can only stay at home, waiting for me.

You've got changed?

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,390
It is the Lantern Festival today.

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,550
And I have a date tonight.

56
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,670
You do?

57
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,030
Alright.

58
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,270
Let's set off now.

59
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,070
For your first date,

60

let's be back soon.

61
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
Yes, Young Master.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,320
What about you?

63
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,350
Do you have any plans for tonight?

64
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,390
No.

65
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,700
Young Master.

66
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,350
You've been sitting here

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
and nodding for two days.

68
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,850
It should

69
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,530
have been enough.

70
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,090

71
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,550
Greetings, Master.

72
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,190
Mo.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,870
I've been explaining to Master

74
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,460
for you these days.

75
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,350
But

76
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,950
I can barely hide it from him anymore.

77
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,350
Thank you.

78
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,600
Is it so serious?

79
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,470
You don't understand.

80
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,590
I do.

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,430
How confident I was,

82
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,510
how embarrassed I was

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,110
earlier today.

84
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,670
No.

85
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,970
I can't give up.

86
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,590
By the way,

87
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,100
how is the Yu Mansion?

88
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,159
Yu Xixi hasn't gone out since she went back.

89
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,310
There are many guards outside Yu Mansion.

90
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,220
We can't get close to it.

91
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,430
However,

92
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,710
I heard that Yu Zhao and Jing Gang

93
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,630
were not in the mansion.

94
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,950
Yu Zhao left for Hangcheng

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,550
to work this morning.

96
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,190
Yu Zhao is not home?

97
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,620
If he's not home,

98
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,180
it will be my chance.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,230
But how are you going to get in?

100
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,480
Well...

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
I need to come up with an idea.

102
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,550
Really?

103
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,790
A bad idea, isn't it?

104
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,510
Yu Zhao is really mean.

105
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,880
He's out for working

106
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,030
but wouldn't let me go out.

107
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,910
He made the Lantern Festival

108
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,720
my lonely festival.

109
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,800
Darn it.

110
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,870
I like you.

111
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,710
Yu Xixi, what are you thinking about?

112
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,830
Xixi, Yu Zhao likes you.

113
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,710
Who are you?

114
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,980
I am your inner mind.

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,190
If you want to know

116
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,270
why Yu Zhao kissed you,

117
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,510
you should ask him.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,440
Should I?

119
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,910
But I don't know how to.

120
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,960
Sober up, Xixi.

121
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,790
Don't listen to her.

122
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,190
I'm your inner mind.

123
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,330
If you really go ask him,

124
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
he will laugh at you.

125
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,750
If he really likes you,

126
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,580
how would he leave you alone at home

127
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,870
and lock you up in your room today?

128
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,630
Xixi.

129
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,640
Don't listen to her.

130
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,710
You have to trust Yu Zhao.

131
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,950
Trust your inner mind.

132
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,990
Don't trust him.

133
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,110
Trust him.

134
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,990
Don't trust him.

135
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,590
Trust him.

136
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,670
Don't trust him.

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,510
Trust him.

138
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,110
Don't trust him.

139
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,990
Trust him.

140
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,870
Don't trust him.

141
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,840
Trust him.

142
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,880
Enough.

143
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,050
Xixi.

144
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,360
Oh my!

145
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,630
Is this a wooden kite?

146
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,240
Yes.

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,110
Where did you get it?

148
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,190
I thought it only existed in  books.

149
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,980
Who am I?

150
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,390
There's nothing I can't get.

151
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,830
By the way,

152
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,270
how dare you come here again?

153
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,470
If it weren't for you,

154
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,880
Yu Zhao wouldn't have locked me up.

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,340
I'm here to apologize to you.

156
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,640
I'm really sorry for what happened last time.

157
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,910
It was so awkward.

158
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,810
I took you as my friend.

159
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,310
But don't worry, Xixi.

160
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,309
I was too hasty last time.

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,870
After what happened last time,

162
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,830
I'll only treat you as my ordinary friend.

163
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,070
The storyteller said

164
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,630
playboys like you

165
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,150
are easy to have crushes on others.

166
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,920
Actually,

167
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,420
you don't even know what you want.

168
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,250
You're right, Xixi.

169
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,030
I'll keep that in mind.

170
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
Alright, I forgive you.

171
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,030
You'd better go back now.

172
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,580
Don't let anyone see you.

173
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,760
Stop.

174
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't have feelings for you.

175
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,160
Miss Xixi.

176
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,990
I mean,

177
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,270
do you want to try this?

178
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,520
Can I?

179
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,270
Of course, you can.

180
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,230
We can go out by this today.

181
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,470
It's the Lantern Festival.

182
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,520
Xixi, you can't go out.

183
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,070
Yu Zhao will be angry if he knows this.

184
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,000
Yu Zhao? But he's not here.

185
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,030
He left you alone on the Lantern Festival.

186
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,150
Why do we need him?

187
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,090
You can't go.

188
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,660
Go with him.

189
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,430
You can't go.

190
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,140
Go with him.

191
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,980
You can't go.

192
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,660
Go with him.

193
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,430
Enough!

194
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,910
I didn't say anything.

195
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,630
I'm not talking to you.

196
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,230
I'll just take a ride on it.

197
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,190
Really?

198
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,710
Let's go.

199
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,470
So beautiful.

200
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,290
It's fun, isn't it?

201
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:11,290
♫Fireworks lighting up in the sky♫

202
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,710
Look at this.

203
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,930
♫Whose love is it?♫

204
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,090
♫A flashing epiphyllum♫

205
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,870
Bravo.

206
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,700
♫Ask, don't wait until the flowers fall♫

207
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,040
♫But who knows the answer?♫

208
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,960
♫Just fall♫

209
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,760
♫How can I get closer?♫

210
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,350
♫How can I smile?♫

211
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,960
♫Where you look back in the lights♫

212
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,050
♫Flowers bloom♫

213
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,040
♫How can I remember it?♫

214
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,640
♫How can I forget it?♫

215
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,920
♫I'm afraid I can never see you again♫

216
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,170
♫How can I remember it?♫

217
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,930
♫How can I forget it?♫

218
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:17,370
♫I'm afraid I can never see you again♫

219
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,860
♫How can I remember it?♫

220
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,590
♫How can I forget it?♫

221
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,270
It's tasty. What's this?

222
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:32,450
♫One more look and I'll never see you♫

223
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,390
Jiaozhui.

224
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,010
Wrap the dough with Chinese date paste inside, make them into balls,

225
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,920
and then fry them in sesame oil.

226
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,110
It's more crispy and tasty

227
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,190
than I can describe.

228
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,150
Jiaozhui?

229
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,830
Haven't you tried it before?

230
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,270
It's a special dish for the Lantern Festival.

231
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,160
My mom said

232
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,870
there were many bad people at night.

233
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,600
They wouldn't let me go out.

234
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,910
It's harder for me to go out after Yu Zhao takes in charge of the family,

235
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,230
especially during festivals.

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,600
It's crowded here,

237
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,580
so I am not allowed to be out.

238
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,710
Poor thing.

239
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,870
Actually,

240
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,970
sometimes,

241
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,360
I think we are quite alike.

242
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,190
I,

243
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,990
since young,

244
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,800
have been forced to practice swordsmanship every day by my father.

245
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,350
He said that I was the young master of Lu Ming Manor,

246
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,350
and I was going to do something big.

247
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,980
We're not alike at all.

248
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,370
At least you have a father.

249
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,390
I don't even know who my parents are.

250
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,570
Let's not talk about this.

251
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,010
But you seem

252
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
familiar with this place.

253
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,790
Of course.

254
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,870
How did you escape before?

255
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,950
I have Mo.

256
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,430
Mo is my father's adopted son.

257
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,230
He's a few years older than me.

258
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,550
He has been more talented in martial arts

259
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,190
than me since we were little.

260
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,790
We practiced swordsmanship

261
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,720
in the manor before.

262
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,320
When we are old enough,

263
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,030
he can do the tasks

264
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,190
given by my father.

265
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,880
So, he can go in and out of the manor freely.

266
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,270
He had sympathy for me

267
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,670
because I was locked up

268
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,750
in the manor every day.

269
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,110
So he secretly

270
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,240
bought me a wooden kite

271
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,230
with all his money.

272
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,390
And then

273
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,750
he took me to the backyard

274
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,640
when my father was away

275
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,980
to practice how to fly this big kite.

276
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,070
It's not long before

277
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,430
I could fly

278
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,110
this wooden kite well.

279
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,190
I used to fly out of the manor

280
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,310
when my father was away.

281
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,190
That's why

282
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm familiar with

283
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,910
the outside world.

284
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,080
Ye Mo is so nice to you.

285
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,570
I think you two...

286
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,730
We two?

287
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,230
It's just...

288
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
What do you mean?

289
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,260
Just tell me.

290
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,780
Do you know why I called you here?

291
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,150
I'm afraid I don't know.

292
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,390
Where is my son?

293
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,290
He...

294
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,790
He has something important to do today.

295
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,790
Something important?

296
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,360
What is it?

297
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,460
It's the important thing that you asked him to do, Master.

298
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,230
I think you've forgotten

299
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,410
what I asked you to do.

300
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,480
I dare not.

301
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,750
Young Master has a thorough plan.

302
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,830
You may rest assured.

303
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,790
What thorough plan can he have?

304
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,230
Will he continue to embarrass himself?

305
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,030
Young Master

306
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,950
wanted to find out the truth

307
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,900
of the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

308
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,390
I think he only wanted to take this opportunity

309
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,550
to hang out

310
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,350
with Yu Xixi.

311
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,700
Don't expect that you can conceal it for him.

312
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,590
Nothing gets past me yet.

313
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,760
I dare not.

314
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,230
He makes friends with Yu Xixi

315
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,750
for the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

316
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,990
I asked you to stay with my son

317
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,230
to keep an eye on him and spur him on.

318
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,390
Even if he's messing around,

319
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,780
you can't mess around with him.

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,580
I'll keep that in mind.

321
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,590
He'll inherit Lu Ming Manor,

322
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,240
so he mustn't fall in love with Yu Xixi.

323
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,070
After getting

324
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,190
the Red Jade of Cangqiong,

325
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,400
if you find him

326
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,230
have feelings for Yu Xixi,

327
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,330
you need to

328
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,440
kill her.

329
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,350
Yes, Master.

330
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,890
Did you see that? It's killing me.

331
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
Yes, it's so funny.

332
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,760
By the way, Xixi.

333
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,550
Look at that mask.

334
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,990
Do you know

335
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,110
the red jade Yu Zhao has?

336
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,840
The red jade?

337
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,230
Which one?

338
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,270
It's...

339
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,370
the one he always wears.

340
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,410
Oh, that piece.

341
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,420
Yes, I saw it before.

342
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,070
He wears it every day as if it is so precious.

343
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,590
What about the red jade Yu Zhao gave you?

344
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,830
Oh, that one.

345
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,320
It's my birthday gift.

346
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,790
I don't know why

347
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,570
he insisted on giving it to me.

348
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,440
But Xiang said

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
other than the sculptures in the middle,

350
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,810
the two pieces of jade look the same.

351
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,030
Well...

352
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,980
What is this?

353
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,380
Young lady,

354
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,310
are you here for fortune-telling?

355
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,830
Fortune-telling?

356
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:46,910
Sure.

357
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,250
50 pence each time.

358
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,910
Here you go.

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,350
Mr. Right...

360
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,830
Congratulations, young lady,

361
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,410
You seem to have met your Mr. Right.

362
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,870
My Mr. Right?

363
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,030
Who?

364
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,360
Don't go. I've paid her.

365
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,870
Let's hear what she will say.

366
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,270
Please be patient.

367
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,910
Let me finish.

368
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,110
But

369
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,710
your fate of marriage with your Mr. Right is not yet fulfilled.

370
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,320
You have to get through three tribulations.

371
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,550
If you can't,

372
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,630
you and your Mr. Right

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,030
will both have an extremely bad ending.

374
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,120
Go on.

375
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,170
Go ahead.

376
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,050
It's obvious that

377
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,070
you are a liar.

378
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,470
Let's go.

379
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,030
Young lady,

380
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,720
here's a poem for you,

381
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,550
"Of Mountain Lu we cannot make out the true face.

382
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,690
For we are lost in the heart of the very place."

383
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,310
Young Master, someone is blocking the way.

384
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,240
Sir, please do me a favor.

385
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,150
Are you Manager Yu?

386
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,310
What can I do for you?

387
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,790
You want money, don't you?

388
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,130
I don't have time to waste here.

389
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,870
I have something urgent to do.

390
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,870
No, I don't want money.

391
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,760
Get out of the way!

392
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,230
Boss.

393
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,350
Jin Gang, let's go.

394
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,910
Yes, Young Master.

395
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,190
Boss.

396
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,750
Why did you let them go?

397
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,690
Why does he

398
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,490
look so familiar?

399
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,590
Miss Meng, let's take a break.

400
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,930
Later,

401
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,120
I'd like to go to the silk shop ahead.

402
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,950
Miss Liu,

403
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,830
please spare me.

404
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,990
We've been shopping since this morning.

405
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,590
I'm too tired to walk any further.

406
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,130
It's just a beginning.

407
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,390
Jin Gang and I are going to

408
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,790
watch the lanterns tonight.

409
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,000
How about

410
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,000
I wait for you here?

411
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,850
Look at you!

412
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,370
Miss Liu.

413
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,990
I think I saw Yu Xixi.

414
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,630
Yu Xixi?

415
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
No way.

416
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,810
Zihe is not in town.

417
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,350
Miss Liu,

418
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,150
I don't think it's Young Master Feng.

419
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,980
It's...

420
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,040
Young Master Ye!

421
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,150
Well...

422
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,940
What's going on?

423
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,460
Although the embarrassing thing just happened two days ago,

424
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,910
they are hanging out again today.

425
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,900
Miss Liu,

426
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,430
it's your opportunity!

427
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,070
Why?

428
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,310
Think about it.

429
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,400
If Yu Zhao knows about this,

430
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,820
he will be furious.

431
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,870
You have a point.

432
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,950
How about this?

433
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,040
You stay here.

434
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,150
I'll inform Zihe at Yu Mansion.

435
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,390
Miss Liu,

436
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,710
I have a date with Jin Gang

437
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,010
at the gate of Huixian Restaurant.

438
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,710
Miss Liu!

439
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,970
Bravo.

440
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,720
It's already 9 p.m..

441
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,680
There are still so many people here.

442
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,850
It's still early.

443
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,070
Haven't you heard of the saying,

444
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,990
"The night market is open until midnight.

445
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,230
And then at five o'clock, it is open again."

446
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,750
I'm glad to be here.

447
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,420
I've never been this happy.

448
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,060
Please order

449
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,600
whatever you want.

450
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,330
I don't know what to order. You decide.

451
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,520
Okay.

452
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,590
May I take the order?

453
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,910
Coming.

454
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,160
No menu needed.

455
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,630
One fried sausages, a plate of rabbit meat,

456
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,070
and half a catty of mutton.

457
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,270
A pot of Longjing tea as well.

458
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,030
Don't drink tea. Let's take a horn.

459
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,080
You sure?

460
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,620
Stop nagging.

461
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,010
Serve it up.

462
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,480
Okay.

463
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,990
Looks like you come here quite often.

464
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,870
Of course.

465
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,230
Mo and I often come here.

466
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,870
I really envy you and Mo.

467
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,280
For what?

468
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,560
I envy your relationship.

469
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,970
Again?

470
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,550
I was just pulling your leg.

471
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,470
Fine.

472
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,510
You know

473
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,310
I like jade very much.

474
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,070
Can you show me

475
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,630
Yu Zhao's

476
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,530
red jade?

477
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,790
Don't worry.

478
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,180
I'll return it to you once I see it.

479
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,480
Why did you mention the red jade again?

480
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,710
Jin Gang.

481
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,270
When we arrive home,

482
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,560
get these fireworks in.

483
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,920
Sure.

484
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,670
Young Master, you're in such an aesthetic mood.

485
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,730
You even bought these fireworks from Hangcheng.

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,030
I don't like them.

487
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,990
They're quite expensive.

488
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,180
But they will disappear in a short time.

489
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,350
You're too young

490
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,510
to understand romance.

491
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,110
Later,

492
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,470
I'll ask Uncle San and Xiang

493
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,150
to watch the fireworks together.

494
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,720
No need.

495
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,310
They will be busy

496
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,800
at Huixian Restaurant all night long.

497
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,230
Just put these in the front yard.

498
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,190
Okay.

499
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,230
I could have watched it with you,

500
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,370
but I have an appointment with Miss Meng.

501
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,650
Zihe.

502
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,170
Young Master,

503
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,950
Miss Liu is coming.

504
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,150
When did she come?

505
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,390
I'll go in first.

506
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,990
What brings you here at the Lantern Festival,

507
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,860
Miss Liu?

508
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,240
I happened to see

509
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,520
Yu Xixi and Ye Chenxing

510
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,910
go to Bei Wa.

511
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,470
So I'm here to inform you.

512
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,750
Thank you for your kindness.

513
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,720
I got it.

514
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,660
Anyway, when I saw them,

515
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,750
the two

516
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,110
were talking happily.

517
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,230
They also laughed a lot.

518
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:54,930
Got it.

519
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,330
Thank you.

520
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,190
Zihe.

521
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,190
Young Master.

522
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,310
The fireworks have been put in the yard.

523
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,780
Young Master.

524
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,170
Young Master, where are you going?

525
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,000
Never mind. I have to meet Miss Meng now.

526
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,650
Xixi, stop drinking.

527
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,790
You've drunk too much.

528
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,110
Don't spoil the mood.

529
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,470
By the way, Xixi,

530
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,510
Has Yu Zhao been so unreasonable since he was a kid?

531
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,990
How would I know?

532
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,550
How could you not know?

533
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,910
You two grew up together after all.

534
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,320
You finally stopped talking about the red jade,

535
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,630
but why did you start to bring Yu Zhao up?

536
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,090
Wait a second.

537
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,350
Bravo.

538
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,550
Excuse me, sir.

539
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,170
Please let me put on a show.

540
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,530
Come down.

541
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm Yu Xixi from Yu family.

542
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,550
I'm so happy today.

543
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,810
I'll show you a little trick.

544
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,510
Can you?

545
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,210
♫Fireworks lighting up in the sky♫

546
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,550
♫Whose love is it?♫

547
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,210
♫A flashing epiphyllum♫

♫Just fall♫

♫How can I get closer?♫

552

♫How can I smile?♫

♫Where you look back in the lights♫

♫Flowers bloom♫

Thank you.

561
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,870
This is the happiest Lantern Festival I've ever had.

562
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,200
From today onwards,

563
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,400
♫There is a mist in my dreams♫

564
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,550
you'll be my best friend.

565
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,440
The best friend?

566
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,190
What's wrong?

567
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,180
♫Wake up, don't wait for everyone to leave♫

568
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,190
Nothing.

569

You don't have to thank me.

570
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,670
I had so much fun, too.

571
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,630
By the way,

572
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,900
♫I'll be alone with grey hair♫

573
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,910
how did you make it on the stage?

574
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,470
It was just a trick.

575
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,190
But it was really amazing.

576
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,500
It's called "dancing butterflies in lights".

577
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,110
It's a trick of Phantasmagoria.

578
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,200
Grind saltpeter and golden sea sand into powder,

579
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,080
and then hide the powder in your nails.

580
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,070
If I flick it above the fire,

581
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,290
they will fly like butterflies.

582
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,470
It was really cool.

583
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,120
I admire your talent.

584
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,950
I'm flattered.

585
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,480
I didn't expect you to know these.

586
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,730
When I was young, I had a wooden ball

587
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,070
and several bottles.

588
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,670
But my mother didn't tell me what they were.

589
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,970
So I studied it myself.

590
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,940
Later I found out

591
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,470
they were a mechanical ball and a furnace.

592
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,420
So I started to be into those things

593
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,470
which are called "evil things" by Yu Zhao.

594
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,430
I don't think

595
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,910
it's something evil.

596
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,870
What people like to do

597
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,750
and should do

598
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,350
can only be decided by themselves.

599
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,350
Just like me.

600
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,890
I don't like martial arts since I was young,

601
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,950
but I was born in a family of martial arts.

602
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,830
And I only want to live freely,

603
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,920
traveling around the country

604
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,210
and having all kinds of delicious food.

605
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,380
So,

606
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,520
I understand you.

607
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,270
Sometimes,

608
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,680
I think we are really alike.

609
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,190
It's getting late.

610
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,150
I must go home.

611
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,070
I'll take you home now.

612
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,030
Shall we fly back?

613
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,920
Yes, of course.

614
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,000
Are you going to walk in through the front door of the Yu Mansion?

615
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,680
Okay, let's go.

616
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,070
Let's go.

617
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,330
Yu Xixi.

618
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,580
Yu Zhao.

619
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,940
Where have you been?

620
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,550
Nowhere.

621
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
You went to Ye Chenxing's.

622
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,350
No.

623
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,750
He came to me.

624
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,670
Didn't I tell you to

625
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,710
stay here and wait for me?

626
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,140
But...

627
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,610
But what?

628
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,880
Do you know what I bought for you in Hangcheng?

629
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,110
What is that?

630
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,350
Nothing.

631
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
You know nothing, Yu Xixi.

632
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,960
Yes, I know nothing.

633
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
It is the Lantern Festival today.

634
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,800
But you left me alone at home.

635
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,550
I was working.

636
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,500
Yes.

637
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,160
Your job is your priority.

638
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,620
Yu Xixi,

639
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,950
do you know what you're doing?

640
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,090
What's wrong with going out with Ye Chenxing?

641
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,380
Ye Chenxing is ten thousand times better than you.

642
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,310
What did you say?

643
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,040
Yu Zhao, I hate the feelings

644
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,480
that you're always controlling  me.

645
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,500
I'm neither your wife

646
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:54,590
nor your sibling.

647
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,790
Why do you keep controlling me every day?

648
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,870
Yu Xixi!

649
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,860
Oh, I see.

650
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,460
You're used to treating me as your subordinate

651
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,270
and letting me live in your control

652
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,030
because of your self-esteem and desire for possession.

653
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,720
Enough!

654
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,760
I've had enough of you, Yu Zhao!

655
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,020
Listen,

656
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,710
I'll cut all ties with you.

657
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,610
It has nothing to do with you who I hang out with.

658
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,670
No matter Ye Chenxing or Ma Chenxing,

659
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,540
it has nothing to do with you!

660
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,950
Fine.

661
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:44,730
♫People are having fun with fireworks and lanterns♫

662
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:53,800
♫The heartbroken man is speechless in the cold spring breeze♫

663
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:02,060
♫They should have loved each other♫

664
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:06,300
♫But it seems to be an unrequited love♫

665
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:14,270
♫Who is awake in the middle of the night?♫

666
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,730
♫I wish I could be the stars and you could be the moon♫

667
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,560
♫Dancing with you in the palace on high♫
