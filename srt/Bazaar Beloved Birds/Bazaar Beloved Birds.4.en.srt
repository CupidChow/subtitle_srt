we've got 550 taels.

195
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,080
I knew it.

196
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,160
In this world,

197
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,670
there's nothing I can't do.

198
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,310
550 taels.

199
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,030
Let’s see what Yu Zhao will say.

200
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,510
Miss,

201
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,070
why do I feel uneasy?

202
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,000
Young Master gave the jade pendant to you.

203
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,020
But you sold it.

204
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,010
What will happen if Young Master finds it out?

205
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,570
Miss,

206
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,920
I didn't know you can do this.

207
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,390
Yu Zhao said I only know

208
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,620
novel techniques.

209
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,350
How is it? It worked.

210
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,030
But...

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,430
There's no buts.

212
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,110
Isn't it Xixi's capability?

213
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,830
Right?

214
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,030
Put them away.

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,430
Hurry up. Put them away.

216
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,580
Miss,

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,370
did you offend Young Master today?

218
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,830
He looked angry as soon as he came back.

219
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,760
He kept silent for the whole afternoon.

220
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,440
What's wrong with him?

221
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,400
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

222
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,630
Where is he? I am looking for him.

223
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,710
He should be in the front hall.

224
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,480
Be careful with your words.

225
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't say anything wrong again.

226
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,590
I know, Uncle.

227
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
Forget it, I'll go with you.

228
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,710
Young Master, you're here.

229
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,990
Let's go.

230
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Yu Zhao.

231
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,190
You...

232
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,570
Young Master.

233
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,990
Young Master.

234
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,510
What is it?

235
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,350
Miss...

236
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,190
Do you remember the bet on our wedding day?

237
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,180
Yes, why?

238
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,670
Xiang.

239
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,420
Here is 550 taels.

240
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,360
It's far more than the 100 taels of the bet.

241
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,190
I won.

242
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,710
You must keep your promise.

243
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,790
I will.

244
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,650
But how did you

245
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,990
make this money?

246
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,430
It's none of your business.

247
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,870
I won anyway.

248
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,030
Well,

249
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,550
where is the red jade I sent you?

250
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,940
Red jade?

251
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,140
It's here.

252
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,570
That's weird.

253
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,030
Why is it here?

254
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,430
Why is there another jade?

255
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,460
I should ask you why.

256
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,500
I don't know.

257
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,360
Xiang.

258
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,750
Jin Gang, take the money.

259
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,590
Yes.

260
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,350
Wait.

261
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,460
Miss.

262
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,240
You sold the things in my name,

263
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,150
so the money will naturally belong to me.

264
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,760
The most hateful thing is

265
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,200
you sold the red jade I gave you.

266
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,750
I...

267
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,270
Jin Gang,

268
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,470
read it to her.

269
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,940
Yes.

270
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,710
The crimes of Yu Xixi are as follows.

271
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,980
The first crime

272
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,470
is for mismanagement.

273
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,400
With the help of Yu Zhao,

274
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
Yu Xixi managed the Jianghu Public House,

275
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,080
but she colluded with the martial artists

276
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,450
causing the public house

277
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,770
severe losses

278
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,870
in the conflict.

279
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,470
What do you mean by colluding with the martial artists? I...

280
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,600
Miss.

281
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,790
Yu Xixi,

282
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,770
do you admit the first crime?

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,710
Yes.

284
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,490
Go on.

285
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,440
The second crime

286
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,910
is making decisions without permission.

287
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,680
Yu Xixi

288
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,840
auctioned in the name of Yu Zhao behind his back.

289
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,750
This is extremely vicious

290
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,950
and has seriously tarnished Yu Zhao's reputation.

291
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,430
Yu Xixi,

292
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,710
do you admit it?

293
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,870
Yes.

294
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,880
The third crime

295
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,340
is selling the jade pendant given by Yu Zhao without his permission,

296
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,030
which has caused irreversible psychological harm

297
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,680
to Yu Zhao.

298
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,870
Add one term.

299
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,990
The fourth crime

300
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,390
is fabricating the red jade

301
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,150
and trying to fool me,

302
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,100
but you don't know the sincerity couldn't be faked.

303
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,470
What the hell is the sincerity you are talking about?

304
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,360
Miss. Miss.

305
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,070

307
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,230
Enough.

308
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,950
In general,

309
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,920
Yu Xixi committed the crime of being a fool.

310
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,150
Yu Xixi,

311
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
do you admit this crime?

312
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,250
You're bullying me, Yu Zhao.

313
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,120
Looks like you have an objection.

314
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:00,810
I...

315
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,950
In that case,

316
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,910
I declare

317
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,150
the Jianghu Public House will be shut down.

318
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,520
All the items and signatures

319
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,190
will be dealt with to pay off the debt.

320
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,360
No.

321
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,140
It is my last effort.

322
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,470
I admit it.

323
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,830
Fine.

324
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,270
Since you've admitted it, you'll be punished.

325
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,550
From now on,

326
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,570
the Jianghu Public House will be closed indefinitely.

327
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
The reopening time

328
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,200
depends on your performance.

329
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,680
Indefinite closing?

330
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,650
Indefinite closing, or shutdown.

331
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,560
It's up to you.

332
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,310
I'll choose indefinite closing.

333
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,030
It's a wise choice.

334
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,550
You must

335
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,920
wear the red jade all the time.

336
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,790
Don't ever try to sell it to get money again.

337
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,510
Got it.

338
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,750

339
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,560
is still on you.

340
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,040
The bet continues.

341
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,910
I...

342
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,310
The public house is shut down.

343
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,820
How can I continue the bet?

344
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,860
Don't worry.

345
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,280

350
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,760
You want me to be a waitress?

351
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,590
You are making money to pay the debt.

352
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,630
There are

353
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,950
two and a half months left until the bet is over.

354
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,950
But a waitress' salary is to enough to pay it back.

355
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,790
That's not true.

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,340
♫Walk over mountains and seas♫

385
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,060
♫I fly in the air like a swallow♫

386
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,830
♫Looking up, I see mountains and rivers under sunset♫

387
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,730
♫I taste love and see through many people♫

388
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,640
♫I leave without leaving any trace♫

389
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,150
♫All of us are lonely♫

390
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,700
When will it come to an end?

391
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,670
Miss.

392
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,620
Who is it?

393
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,980
Young Master worried that you might be hungry at night,

394
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,030
so he asked the chef

395
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,470
to make the fish soup for you.

396
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,270
Miss.

397
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,230
I don't want it.

398
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,990
I'll take it back then.

399
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,910
Wait.

400
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,859
Don't waste it.

401
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,280
Give me a bowl of rice.

402
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,940
OK.

403
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:37,990
Master.

404
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,720
I told you

405
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,530
not to disturb my cultivation.

406
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,560
There's a clue about the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

407
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,550
Which one is it?

408
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:47,750
I'm not sure.

409
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,030
What do you mean?

410
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,610
It

411
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,090
looks exactly like the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

412
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,670
But the pattern

413
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,890
is a jumping carp.

414
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,630
That's not right.

415
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,280
There were fire phoenix, crane

416
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,520
and dragon

417
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,240
on the Red Jade of Cangqiong of Hero Knife, Sword and Laugh.

418
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,950
There was no carp.

419
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,160
Where did you find it?

420
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,830
Xianyun City.

421
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,480
Xianyun City?

422
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,510
According to the message,

423
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,990
a few days ago,

424
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,790
Yu Xixi, the manager of Jianghu Public House in Xianyun City,

425
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,410
held an auction,

426
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,630
in which there was

427
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,670
a red jade which looked like the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

428
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,350
Yu Xixi?

429
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,960
She is just an ordinary woman.

430
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,780
According to the letter,

431
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,080
there is a pair of red jade pendants.

432
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,230
Yu Zhao, the manager of Huixian Restaurant,

433
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,510
has another one.

434
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,470
But

435
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,870
no one has seen

436
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,070
the pattern on it.

437
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,440
Yu Zhao?

438
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,960
His age

439
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,550
matches it.

440
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,350
Looks like I have to go to Xianyun City.

441
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,690
Calm down. Maybe it's fate.

442
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,620
Young Master has been to Xianyun City.

443
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,670
And he seems to have had contact with

444
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,190
Yu Zhao and Yu Xixi.

445
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,590
Why don't we send Young Master to investigate?

446
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,030
Where is he?

447
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,470
Young Master.

448
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,750
Are you okay?

449
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,910
If you are not feeling well,

450
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,470
you can lean on me.

451
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm fine.

452
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,420
Sorry for getting you into trouble.

453
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,560
Since Shadow came to the Manor,

454
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,990
it seems I have another father.

455
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,710
Now even if my father is in cultivation,

456
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,230
I can't sneak out.

457
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,820
We have no choice.

458
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,270
Master trusts Shadow.

459
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,040
Sometimes when I think about it,

460
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,370
I think everything is boring.

461
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,210
My father forced me to learn the Lu Ming Sword Skill

462
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,230
and taught me how to become a good master.

463
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,680
He even arranged

464
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,470
who I should love  and who I shouldn't love.

465
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,910
But this is not what I want.

466
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,930
Actually,

467
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,230
I envy you a lot.

468
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,750
Envy me?

469
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,940
You've been able to go on missions since your childlhood.

470
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,350
But I could only feel the outside world

471
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,910
through your description.

472
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,990
Young Master.

473
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,910
Forget it.

474
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,070
Let's change the subject.

475
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,030
By the way,

476
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,140
do you think

477
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,510
Yu Xixi has a kind of energy?

478
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,760
What?

479
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,710
I can't say it clearly.

480
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,230
It's

481
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,590
an unyielding vitality.

482
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,590
Compared to her,

483
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,230
I am far from it.

484
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,150
Young Master,

485
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,180
everyone has their own fate.

486
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,950
You are doomed to be

487
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,790
the Young Master of Lu Ming Manor.

488
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:38,950
Fate?

489
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,150
Father,

490
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,670
why did you end the cultivation?

491
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,490
I want you to go back to the Xianyun City.

492
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,480
The Red Jade of Cangqiong

493
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,910
might have appeared.

494
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,830
What? Where?

495
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,600
In the Xianyun City.

496
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,910
Maybe

497
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,360
in the Jianghu Public House or Huixian Restaurant.

498
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Yu Xixi.

499
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,510
You two set off tomorrow.

500
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,420
Besides,

501
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,100
I'll arrange the people and money for you.

502
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,950
Remember,

503
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,260
investigate thoroughly

504
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,750
about the Red Jade of Cangqiong.

505
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,630
Yes.

506
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,120
Yu Xixi.

507
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,910
How could it be?

508
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,550
Yu Xixi.

509
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,680
Young Master,

510
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,830
it's not the time for indulging in love.

511
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,150
You should know your place.

512
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,470
You can't achieve anything with emotions.

513
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,990
I'll get ready.

514
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,160
Let’s go back to the Xianyun City tomorrow.

515
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,410
You know

516
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Master’s tricks.

517
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,510
Okay.

518
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,280
I'll go to Yu Xixi tomorrow.

519
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,440
Now, only you can protect her.

520
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,740
[Huixian Restaurant]

521
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,720
Welcome. Please come in.

522
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,450
Ye.

523
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,590
I am annoyed.

524
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,510
Xixi.

525
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,430
Ye Chenxing!

526
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:27,890
I...

527
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,030
Why did you disappear suddenly?

528
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,170
I went to see you, but you refused to meet me.

529
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,430
Are you my friend?

530
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,460
I was busy with work.

531
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,480
I didn't see you busy

532
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,260
before.

533
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,320
I swear.

534
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
I really had no spare time.

535
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,990
I came to you

536
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,290
as soon as I finished my work.

537
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,570
No use now.

538
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,800
The public house was shut down.

539
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,870
Forget it. Have a seat.

540
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,950
Young Master, let's get down to business.

541
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:53,990
Okay.

542
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,870
Help me find a way to make money.

543
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,590
Make money?

544
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,870
What's wrong?

545
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,920
I heard you had an auction

546
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,790
a few days ago.

547
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:08,550
Yes.

548
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,190
What?

549
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,430
Are you interested in the auction?

550
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,520
No.

551
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,540
I'm just asking.

552
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,830
Don't mention it.

553
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,350
I was angry about the auction.

554
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,230
I don't know what's wrong with Yu Zhao.

555
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,470
It's just a red jade.

556
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,710
Why should I wear it every day?

557
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,070
Can you show me

558
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,710
the red jade?

559
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,470
You want to see it?

560
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,830
Why do I feel

561
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,070
you are weird today?

562
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,990
No.

563
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,790
I just...

564
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,030
Just what?

565
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,070
Look into my eyes.

566
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,800
Are you

567
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,630
interested in jade?

568
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,750
Yes.

569
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,460
I have loved jade since I was young.

570
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:53,830
Here.

571
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,870
The jade pendant

572
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,430
seems to be a pair.

573
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,350
Yu Zhao has the other one.

574
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,630
What does

575
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,970
it look like?

576
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,990
I don't know. I've never seen it either.

577
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
Do you know

578
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,670
how Yu Zhao got it?

579
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,670
I think it is mother's legacy.

580
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,670
Then your mother is...

581
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,020
Please take care of the merchant ship, Mr. Wang.

582
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,860
No problem.

583
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,200
Mr. Yu.

584
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,910
What are you doing here?

585
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,360
Huixian Restaurant

586
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,600
is a famous building in the Xianyun City.

587
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,180
Can't I come?

588
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,590
No.

589
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,860
Mr. Yu is so domineering.

590
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,540
This restaurant is mine.

591
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,990
I have the right.

592
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,300
What if I refuse to leave?

593
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:09,890
See him off.

594
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,920
Stop it.

595
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,700
I lost to you last time because I was careless.

596
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,500
This time,

597
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,700
I'll show you my strength.

598
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,110
Since you insist on competing,

599
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,920
I'll do as you say.

600
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:35,030
Mo,

601
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,320
stop at where you should.

602
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,640
Good.

603
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,950
Bravo!

604
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,380
Mo,

605
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,590
that's all for today.

606
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,480
I don't want to disturb your business, Manager Yu.

607
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,990
See you.

608
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,600
Xixi.

609
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,630
See you.

610
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,690
Young Master,

611
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,750
I don't understand

612
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,490
why did you ask me to fight just now?

613
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Mo, your swordsmanship is better than mine,

614
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,400
but you are not as clever as me.

615
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
I was testing Yu Zhao.

616
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,550
Test?

617
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,350
Yes.

618
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,970
During the competition,

619
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,780
I've been observing Yu Zhao.

620
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,420
His eyes

621
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,680
had no trace of fear.

622
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,230
Do you think

623
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,570
it is normal

624
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,630
for an ordinary guy?

625
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,990
You mean...

626
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,830
I mean

627
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,290
Yu Zhao may not be a businessman.

628
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,630
Or,

629
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,760
the Yu family is not just doing business.

630
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,170
According to Yu Xixi,

631
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,070
the red jade

632
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,130
is Zang Muxiang's legacy.

633
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,870
Then there's something wrong with Zang Muxiang.

634
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,310
First, we need to figure out

635
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,790
what does the red jade of Yu Zhao look like

636
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,230
before making the next arrangement.

637
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,760
What about Yu Xixi?

638
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,800
Do you see anything from her?

639
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,060
I don't think there is something abnormal with her.

640
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,470
She must have no problem.

641
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,270
Young Master, don't be emotional.

642
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,870
I'm not.

643
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,230
Young Master, two girls came to visit you.

644
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,400
They are in the front hall now.

645
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,020
Visit me?

646
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,610
Yes.

647
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,660
Zihe.

648
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,780
Miss, please behave yourself.

649
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,910
Miss, you must have mistaken me for someone else.

650
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,010
Zihe.

651
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,950
Don't you remember me?

652
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm Liu Ruoyu.

653
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,380
I am Ruoyu.
