A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 5

3
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,600
It looks like Lei is going
to confess to Jing.

4
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,720
Aren't they already together?

5
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,680
I thought when they were in Sanya,
they had...

6
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Had what?

7
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Nothing.

8
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,960
What kind of relationship
do they have now, then?

9
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
Jing is someone very important to Lei.

10
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Lei actually suffered
from a mild case of autism.

11
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
His mom was particularly strict too.

12
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
His autism got worse because of that.

13
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,920
We didn't know how to help him.

14
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
Thankfully, Jing appeared.

15
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,520
No matter how indifferent Lei was,
how much he avoided her,

16
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Jing wouldn't stop looking for him.

17
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,240
The reason Lei is who he is today...

18
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,480
LET'S GO PLAY, OKAY?

19
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Is because of Jing.

20
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,920
I have something to tell you.

21
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,280
I--

22
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,080
I know.

23
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,600
Thanks, everyone,
for coming to the party tonight.

24
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,400
please welcome the birthday girl,
Teng Tangjing,

26
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
to make her birthday wish.

27
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Thank you for taking the time
to come to my birthday party.

28
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,440
Today, I'm turning 24.

29
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,640
After my graduation,

30
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,320
it's time to make some
real life decisions.

31
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
There's something

32
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,760
I'd like to announce here.

33
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,400
I've decided

34
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,400
to give up my position
as the heir of Tengtang Investment Group

35
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,840
to join Lawyers Without Borders.

36
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,600
-What?
-Is she really going to?

37
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
I want to help the poor.

38
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,080
Jing, what are you blabbering about?

39
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Dad, Mom.

40
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,120
Please forgive my stubbornness.

42
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Pretend you married off your daughter.

43
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,880
I'll be going back to Paris in a few days.

44
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,640
I've no immediate plans to come back.

45
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
All this while, thanks to my family,

46
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,840
I've led a blessed and comfortable life.

47
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
But I know,

48
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,120
living a comfortable life
without a real purpose

49
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
is not what I want.

50
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,160
From now on,

51
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I no longer need

52
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,280
these beautiful clothes

53
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,600
needing delicate care.

54
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
I want to be myself.

55
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Lei! Hey.

56
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,559
You shouldn't go.

57
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Lei.

58
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,880
I'm sorry.

59
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
I know what you had wanted to tell me.

60
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I cannot say yes.

61
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,800
You only need to say a few words

62
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,880
in support of the partnership
between your mother and my company.

63
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,880
I'd be deeply grateful.

64
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry. I never paid much attention
to my mom's business.

65
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
I can't add much.

66
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,880
All you need to do
is put in a few good words.

67
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I'll be happy to oblige
any requests you have.

68
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,640
If you insist that I say something,

69
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,600
I guess you'll need to wait
until I take over.

70
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,120
Not to mention,

71
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,960
only if your company
could survive until then.

72
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,080
If you won't help, fine. Damn you.

73
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,800
Hey! Why were you eavesdropping?

74
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
Why would I eavesdrop on you?

75
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,080
Stop getting ahead of yourself.

76
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
Who would want to listen
to all your bullshit?

77
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,040
As if you're so incredible.

78
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,280
"As if"? I am incredible.

79
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,240
Do you know how many people
want to see my mom, but they can't?

80
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,960
Anyone that can't see her
come to me instead.

81
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,360
It's a winner-take-all world.

82
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,960
You won't understand.

83
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,480
This is exactly your problem.
You think you're all that.

84
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,600
That's how you managed to get
the model just now.

85
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,960
What a professional!

86
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey, those girls are only after me
because of the Daoming name.

87
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
I would never be with a girl like that.

88
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Why are you yelling at me?

89
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,920
You've brought me nothing but trouble.

90
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,440
Also,

91
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,840
you haven't apologized

92
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,960
for what happened last time.

93
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
Why should I apologize?

94
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,080
-It was your fault!
-What did I do?

95
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
-You never said anything.
-That's why you're an idiot.

96
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,600
You don't even know what you did wrong.

97
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,560
You're the idiot.

98
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,040
Hey. Hey!

99
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,560
What are you doing?

100
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,320
You shouldn't do this in public.

101
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
-Listen up.
-Isn't that Daoming Si?

102
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
You fell on me.

103
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,640
I didn't do anything.

104
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,600
It just looks like I did something to you.

105
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
Gross.

106
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Gross?

107
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
Hey, are you okay?

108
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
Hey!

109
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
Hey! Stop, no!

110
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,560
What the hell?

111
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Mom.

112
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,880
How did I get home last night?

113
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you seriously asking me?

114
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,360
Daoming Si brought you home.

115
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,720
What?

116
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,840
Daoming Si did?

117
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,920
Yes.

118
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,360
Daoming Si is truly a nice guy.

119
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,520
He's handsome and so thoughtful.

120
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
Not to mention, a real gentleman.

121
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,960
If he were my son-in-law,
I'd smile in my sleep.

122
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,120
I feel like my head is exploding.

123
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,560
Sit down and rest then.

124
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Why are you still here?

125
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
-Zhen is there.
-Let's go.

126
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,680
Zhen, what happened at home yesterday?

127
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,880
Is it settled?

128
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
It wasn't a big deal.

129
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
What's wrong? Are you sick?

130
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm fine. I've taken medication.

131
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Oh, Zhen.

132
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you want to see the photos
we took at Jing's birthday party?

133
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
Here.

134
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,400
Xiaoyou and I had so many
French pastries last night.

135
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920
And Jing looked amazingly beautiful.

136
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,520
Aren't these photos great?

137
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
They're great.

138
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,680
And you know what?

139
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,160
Jing actually announced
that she's giving up her inheritance.

140
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
She's going to study law in France.

141
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,040
And she cut off her hair
to show her determination.

142
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,800
-We were all shocked.
-Yes.

143
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,360
I heard from some seniors who were there.

144
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,240
Why are you eating so little today?

145
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,320
Money is a little tight at home lately.

146
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm not feeling well.

147
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
I should go.

148
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,720
Remember to take your medication.

149
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Dong Shancai. Dong Shancai.

150
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
Don't you have anything to say?

151
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,600
What do you want?

152
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
You ruined my suit last night.

153
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
Not even a sorry from you?

154
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,480
You haven't apologized
for what happened last time either.

155
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,680
If you don't want to apologize,
shouldn't you at least thank me?

156
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
Don't forget that I carried you home.

157
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,480
You want me to thank you?

158
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Okay.

159
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Listen carefully.

160
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,760
Thank you. What now?

161
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,760
You were so drunk last night.

162
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,840
You said so many things.

163
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,880
Jing is going back to Paris.

164
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
Is that why you're happy?

165
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,119
Do you think

166
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,520
you can be with Lei now?

167
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Are you all right?

168
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
Do I look like I'm not?

169
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,000
You must be shocked
by Jing's decision too, right?

170
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
Are you going to let her go?

171
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,560
That isn't my decision to make.

172
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
Jing has always been strong-willed.

173
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,160
She chooses her own path.

174
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,400
She doesn't like being dictated to.

175
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,280
This is just like what she'd do.

176
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,080
But if she really left,

177
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,800
she'll be in Paris
while you're in Shanghai.

178
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,720
What if...

179
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,920
What if she fell in love
with someone else?

180
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,440
What then?

181
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,360
Go and stop her.

182
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,200
You want her to stay, don't you?

183
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,320
Maybe she'll listen to you.

184
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,320
No.

185
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,200
Once Jing makes a decision,

186
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,160
nobody can do anything to change her mind.

187
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
When I heard that Jing is going to France,

188
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
there was a brief moment

189
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,200
when I felt a sudden flash of happiness.

190
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
I thought maybe with Jing gone,

191
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,080
Huaze Lei would forget about her
and notice me, who's right here.

192
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,240
But right now,

193
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,320
all those selfish thoughts
are out the window.

194
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,280
This is the first time that I've seen
Huaze Lei so depressed.

195
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,360
Deep down, I don't feel happy either.

196
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Thanks for coming to my party.

197
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
There were too many people.
I didn't have the chance to talk to you.

198
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,320
Why did you want to see me?

199
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Jing.

200
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
Can you not go to Paris?

201
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,920
There are places in Shanghai
for international studies too.

202
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
Did Lei ask you to say this?

203
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,080
No.

204
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,040
It's all me.

205
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,520
I can tell that Huaze Lei

206
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,000
really looked forward to you
coming back from London.

207
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
He didn't try to stop you going to Paris

208
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,080
because he didn't want to pressure you.

209
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,960
Actually,

210
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,880
he really wants you to stay with him.

211
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
He'd be really sad if you left.

212
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,240
So...

213
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,520
So can you please...

214
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,760
not go?

215
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
For Huaze Lei. Shancai.

216
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,600
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I can't do it.

218
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,520
Jing.

219
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,920
I wouldn't want Lei to be sad too.

220
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,480
But...

221
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,320
call me stubborn or selfish.

222
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I won't change my mind for anyone.

223
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,120
Huaze Lei told me the same thing.

224
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,280
But I don't get it.

225
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,520
Don't you like him?

226
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,880
To me,

227
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,600
love isn't the most important thing
in this world.

228
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,480
The most important thing to me

229
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,680
is to go after what I dream of.

230
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,840
I don't like regrets.

231
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm going to push through

232
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,960
and fight for my own dream.

233
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Shancai.

234
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,800
Thanks for your concern.

235
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
I need to go now.

236
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
What are you doing? What was that about?

237
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,440
Who asked you to do it?

238
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
-I thought I could--
-What?

239
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,160
I thought I could persuade her.

240
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,800
Who do you think you are?

241
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,400
Did you think you were being helpful? Stop interfering!

242
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
But...

243
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,800
you two might not meet again.

244
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,400
I don't want to see you sad.

245
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
It's none of your business.

246
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,880
Get lost!

247
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,600
Do a headstand when you want to cry.

248
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,640
This way, the tears won't fall.

249
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,880
Why?

250
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,120
Why was Huaze Lei so angry?

251
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
What did I do wrong?

252
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,280
Who do you think you are?

253
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Did you think you were being helpful? Huaze Lei is right.

254
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,960
What right do I have
to interfere with Jing?

255
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,080
I just made it harder for him.

256
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,440
INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE

257
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,200
You still can't reach Lei?

258
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
He's been out of reach since yesterday.

259
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,840
He knows very well that Jing is leaving.

260
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,920
He didn't answer my call.

261
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Maybe my phone would work. Should I call him?

262
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,640
Huaze Lei won't even come to say goodbye?

263
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,680
Si.

264
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,480
Isn't Lei with you?

265
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,800
He's not here?

266
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
What's that box?

267
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
This?

268
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,880
It's a present for Jing.

269
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,000
It's something special.

270
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,600
I won't show it to just anyone.

271
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,200
-Let me see.
-No.

272
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,120
-Come on, let me.
-No.

273
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,040
Thanks. Thank you!

274
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,800
What is wrong with you?

275
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,280
-What, Qinghe?
-What?

276
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,680
-It was pretty funny.
-Not at all.

277
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,400
If Huaze Lei could be more like this guy,

278
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,160
he wouldn't be so miserable.

279
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,280
Hey.

280
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,240
Why do you look so sad?

281
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,720
You're already ugly.

282
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Looking sad just makes it worse.

283
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,120
Daoming Si.

284
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,400
Do you have someone you like?

285
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,600
Why the sudden question?

286
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
This is how it is when you like someone.

287
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,680
As long as they're happy,

288
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
it's okay to stand

289
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
and watch them from a distance.

290
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,160
How stupid must you be
to say such a thing?

291
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,040
If that's the case,
it's as good as nothing.

292
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,240
What if you died tomorrow?

293
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
A lifetime of regret?

294
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,280
If you won't say it,

295
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,680
do you expect them to drill into your head

296
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
to see how depressed you are?

297
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
What a surprise.

298
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,840
A childish idiot like him
managed to verbalize

299
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,040
the problem that's been weighing heavily

300
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,000
on my mind and Huaze Lei's.

301
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,120
Hey, why are you staring
into space, idiot?

302
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
You're the idiot.

303
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
Nobody curses themselves to die tomorrow.

304
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,960
Jing.

305
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm leaving.

306
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
You guys take care.

307
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,360
-Take care.
-Take care.

308
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,760
All the best.

309
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,760
I'll miss you. Stay healthy.

310
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,480
Shancai, I'm sure you'll find happiness.

311
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,520
You too.

312
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,560
Tell Lei to take care of himself.

313
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,040
Don't worry. I'll beat him up for you.

314
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,360
Also,

315
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,800
stop bullying Shancai.

316
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,640
No one has time for that.

317
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,800
For you.

318
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,360
Jing, watch out.

319
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,480
You know, this box is--

320
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,400
Here.

321
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,320
-Passengers on flight
-I'll cherish it

322
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,560
-AF520 to Paris,
-no matter what it is.

323
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,680
-please check in at the boarding gate.
-Time to go. Goodbye.

324
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,920
-Please have your passport ready...
-Bye. All the best.

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Okay.

326
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
Goodbye!

327
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,920
I can't believe Jing just left.

328
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,520
And Lei didn't show up.

329
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,040
Lei.

330
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,480
When did you get here?

331
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,240
An hour ago.

332
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
But we didn't see you.

333
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,560
I was behind the pillar. Why were you hiding?

334
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
Are you satisfied
with seeing her go like that?

335
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,640
What kind of man are you?

336
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,800
People like you who have everything

337
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
have no idea how to work for something.

338
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,040
Jing is brave enough to find her own path.

339
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,360
Why can't you man up
and go after the person you like?

340
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
Go after her if you really like her.

341
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,240
Follow her wherever she goes.

342
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,520
I'm taking the next flight to Paris.

343
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,120
-Well...
-What's this?

344
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,080
If you said it a minute later,
I would have punched you.

345
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,840
Shancai, you're right.

346
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,840
I can't go on like this.

347
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,880
This time, I'm going to go for it.

348
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,640
Thank you.

349
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,360
-Hey.
-Bye.

350
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
It's fine. It was just a peck.

351
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
-Just a peck.
-A peck.

352
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,240
-I won't have it.
-It was just a peck.

353
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,160
-I'm--
-Hey. Hey!

354
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,520
It was just a peck.

355
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,480
-All right.
-Hey!

356
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,520
It was nothing.

357
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,920
Lei may look timid, but he can be tenacious at times.

358
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,320
Shancai is the one that got to him.

359
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,640
I didn't expect that.

360
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,040
Isn't she infatuated with him? Why did she urge him to go after Jing?

361
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,280
Besides, she didn't get into an argument
while talking to Si just now.

362
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,600
How odd.

363
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,120
Maybe that's the power of love.

364
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,760
It's a mystery.

365
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,800
You had to take Huaze Lei to Jing

366
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,600
and let them have a happy life together.

367
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,720
I actually tried to preach to Huaze Lei.

368
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,280
Shame on me.

369
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,920
Dong Shancai.

370
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,160
Let's date.

371
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,520
What did you say?

372
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,920
Are you deaf?

373
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
It was too noisy. I couldn't hear.

374
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
What was it?

375
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,480
Hey! Are you stupid?

376
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,120
I can't say it again. Is this your secret weapon to get girls?

377
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,280
"Limited edition aphrodisiac perfume
to attract the other sex."

378
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
This is the funniest joke I've ever seen.

379
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,560
Si, you know what?
My friend is the one selling the perfume.

380
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,040
Should I order one for you?

381
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,560
Si, you better stash that away properly.

382
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,400
We won't have you ruin
F4's reputation if people found out.

383
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
Go away.

384
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,520
Come on, you're wasting your resources. You've got two love experts right here.

385
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Why are you reading that nonsense?

386
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
First, we want to know.

387
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,360
Who's the target?

388
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
Could it be Dong Shancai?

389
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
No way.

390
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,320
Shancai is infatuated with the other guy.

391
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,560
Right. No matter who it is,

392
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,920
those ads are to trick nerds.

393
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,440
But you're Daoming Si.
You're not like them.

394
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,480
Now,

395
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,840
just let us handle the dating thing.

396
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,720
Tell me then, what would you guys do?

397
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,000
First, you must never be late

398
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
to a date.

399
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,960
You need to arrive
at least ten minutes early.

400
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,240
So when she sees you,

401
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,400
she'll know how important
the date is to you.

402
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,800
Pick a restaurant with a view
and an awesome atmosphere.

403
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,840
Present her with a rose.

404
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,239
With it, a card
that smells like strawberries.

405
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,880
On the card is written...

406
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,080
More ways to have a wonderful date.

407
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Remember, no matter what she says,

408
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,960
you need to look passionately
into her eyes.

409
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,440
Pay attention to what she says.

410
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,240
I had hives when I was younger.

411
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,560
So every time I ate seafood,
I'd get rashes.

412
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,320
The subject I disliked the most
in high school was Biology

413
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,760
because we had to dissect frogs.

414
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,360
It was so scary!

415
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,360
You must have had hives
because you're too cute.

416
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,880
The reason you're scared
of dissecting frogs

417
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,640
must be because you're full of compassion.

418
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
One thing you must remember.

419
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,000
If she asks about
what your past girlfriends were like,

420
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,480
you must never tell her the whole story.

421
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
Say...

422
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
So...

423
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,120
What kind of girls do you like?

424
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,720
To be honest, before I met you,

425
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,960
I didn't know what kind of girls I like.

426
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,040
If she mentions things that make her sad
or heartbroken and cries,

427
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,920
you need to tell her
with a sincere gaze...

428
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,760
He left me just like that.

429
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,000
What did I do wrong?

430
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,800
It's okay.

431
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,040
He left so I could meet you.

432
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,960
By now, you'd have won her heart.

433
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,880
Keep your manners until the end.
Don't be too touchy at the start.

434
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,880
With romantic music playing,

435
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,880
gaze at her affectionally
while you dance together.

436
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,800
That is the perfect ending to a date.

437
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,200
A date is when the souls
of a man and woman

438
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,000
have an intimate conversation.

439
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,800
A perfect date

440
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,080
is the best compliment
you can give to a girl.

441
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,720
You're going to become
the most memorable man in her life.

442
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,400
Hey.

443
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,200
What was all that crap?

444
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
It sounded gross to me.

445
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,160
What?

446
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,760
You're so pathetic
when it comes to romance.

447
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,360
Yes, that's how I am. Don't you have anything simpler?

448
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,880
All right. I'll tell you something easy.

449
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,800
Four words.

450
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,640
Play hard to get.

451
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Who's Harriet?

452
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,600
Did you get a new girlfriend?

453
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,920
I know, Dad. Stop nagging.

454
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,680
I assure you
I'm not being bullied at school.

455
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,720
If anyone tries to touch me,
I'll slap them and tell them to get lost.

456
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,200
NOTIFICATION FROM MINGDE UNIVERSITY BOARD

457
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,200
Shancai.

458
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Look at this.

459
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,200
Daoming Si mentioned us
on the school's bulletin board.

460
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
I'm going to be famous!

461
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,280
It's only been a month

462
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,280
and I'm already on the bulletin board.

463
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
What?

464
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,160
"To everyone.

465
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,600
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

466
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,680
F4 will be challenging Chen Qinghe
and Dong Shancai

467
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,040
to a game of Poker."

468
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,640
Yes.

469
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,160
I got the Joker card
right after I started school.

470
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,360
I didn't expect the game
to happen so soon.

471
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,760
I bet it's because Daoming Si lost to me
catching squid in Sanya.

472
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,040
So he's eager to even up the score.

473
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,000
I'm going to make a post.

474
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,680
The title will be,

475
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,280
"The Ultimate Challenge with F4."

476
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,640
No.

477
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,680
Maybe "Duel of Masters" is better.

478
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
"The Best Challenge in Mingde's History"?

479
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,680
Shancai, which one is best?

480
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,000
None of them.

481
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,080
We're dead meat!

482
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,640
Why are we dead meat?

483
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,920
We get to choose
what we want to bet on, right?

484
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,960
Let's think how we'll get back
at them when we win.

485
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,960
It's not the right time for that.

486
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,480
Why not?

487
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,680
It'll be too late when we win.

488
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,160
If I won, I'd make F4 wear tutu skirts

489
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,560
and do the Black Swan dance.

490
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,280
Or I'd ask Daoming Si to shave his head.

491
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,320
What do you think?

492
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,560
It doesn't matter.

493
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,600
We'll never win.

494
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,720
Don't worry. I'll get you
some intense poker training.

495
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,200
If that worked,
we wouldn't need the police.

496
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
What?

497
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,800
Nothing.

498
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm just blabbering.

499
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,400
-What's going on?
-Yeah.

500
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
They're here.

501
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,960
-They actually showed up.
-That's him.

502
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,400
They really came.

503
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,320
I thought they'd run away.

504
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,240
The outcome won't change.

505
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,680
We'll wait and see how badly they lose.

506
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,480
Open the door.

507
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,960
Why me?

508
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,320
You're a girl. Ladies first.

509
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,160
Together.

510
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,040
Fine, together.

511
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Three,

512
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,240
two,

513
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,520
one.

514
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,840
Why didn't you move?

515
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,640
My legs are wobbly.

516
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,560
One more time.

517
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,160
Three,

518
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,560
two, one.

519
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,440
Welcome to the Poker Room.

520
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,440
I'm the referee today. Come in.

521
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,920
What an extraordinary match.

522
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,520
To be honest,

523
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,800
I'm feeling a bit nervous now.

524
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,080
Give us all you've got, F4!

525
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,120
I, Chen Qinghe, and Shancai
will do whatever it takes.

526
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,480
If you guys lose today,
you'll be at my mercy.

527
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,280
You'll carry my bag for the day.

528
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,440
Just one day? Make it ten years.

529
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,880
You won't win anyway.

530
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,800
You...

531
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,880
Don't underestimate us.

532
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,640
What if I win?

533
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,520
What do you want?

534
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,960
You two will do whatever I want.

535
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,440
-Okay.
-I...

536
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,560
Agreed.

537
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,400
-Qinghe.
-Don't be scared. I'm here.

538
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,800
Take a seat. We'll begin the match.

539
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,760
You two might as well just admit defeat.

540
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,600
We'll never do that.

541
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,640
No need to waste time with them.

542
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,840
Taking advantage of people
who don't know Poker and winning

543
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,760
should not be something
you should brag about.
