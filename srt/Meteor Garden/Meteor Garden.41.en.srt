A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 41

3
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
Shancai, are you with Si?

4
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,640
No.

5
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,720
Why do you look so sad?

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
What happened?

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,520
Daoming Si wants to break up with me.

8
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Dao...

9
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Daoming Si?

10
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,040
That's impossible. He wouldn't do that.

11
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
He told me himself.

12
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
I know.

13
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,920
It must be related with Daoming Si's mom
and my dad's businesses.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
I've never seen that look
on his face before.

15
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,480
Shancai, don't worry.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,760
I'll think of something
once you return to Shanghai, okay?

17
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,400
Keep in touch.

18
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,760
Bye.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,480
I was just wondering
why is my dad going to London tomorrow.

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Si's mom must be getting impatient.

21
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,320
She wants Si to rush
into the arranged marriage

22
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
This is so unlike Si.

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
And Shancai even traveled
thousands of miles to London for him.

24
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,120
How can he have the heart
to turn down Shancai?

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
This makes no sense.

26
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Something serious must have happened.

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,720
Or else it's impossible for Si
to compromise.

28
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,960
Compromise?

29
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,720
Since he already compromised,

30
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
that means

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,160
he's going to do what his mom says
and marry He Group's daughter.

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,360
Wait.

33
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,240
He Group's daughter?

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
You mean me?

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm marrying Daoming Si?

36
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,200
What happens to Shancai then?

37
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,680
Since you're involved in this,

38
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,720
shouldn't you go
and find out what's going on?

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,560
Or you can think of a way
to stop Daoming Feng.

40
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,800
Are you tired?

41
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,920
I didn't do anything.

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,440
I only ate, drank and listened to music.

43
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,880
You should be the one who's tired.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,080
I am tired because I'm Lei.

45
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
We only have one pound left
after paying for the meal earlier.

46
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,440
This is the first money I earned
from playing music.

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,680
It's so interesting.

48
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,440
It's a very memorable first pound.

49
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,320
You have to keep it safe.

50
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,480
I kept the first 100 yuan I earned
in my diary.

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,720
I can't bear to spend it.

52
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,920
I have to commemorate
the first money I earn in a special way.

53
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,040
Wait a moment.

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
Here.

55
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
This is the only thing
that can be bought with one pound.

56
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Didn't you say you want
to commemorate it in a special way?

57
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,360
Giving you a flower in this city
is special to me.

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,200
How are things progressing?

59
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,440
Xiaozi will arrive in a couple of days. Mr. He will also be coming
from the States.

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,720
Also, the reception is confirmed
at the St. James' Court Hotel.

61
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,680
I've already sent you the details.

62
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,360
Ma'am, is there anything else
I can do for you?

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Regarding Si...

64
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Go ahead.

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,280
Watch him. Make sure
he doesn't cause any more trouble.

66
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay. Si.

67
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,480
Miss Xiaozi is on the line.

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,320
Didn't I tell you I won't take her call?

69
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,800
She said you have to take the call.

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,320
Maybe it's something urgent.
Just take the call.

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
How are you, my ex-fiancé?

72
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,960
I called you so many times,
but you refused to answer.

73
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
What is it?

74
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,760
I heard Shancai traveled
thousands of miles to see you in London

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,960
and you sent her away.

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,760
It's just a family enterprise crisis.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,240
Is that a big deal?

78
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
Do you have to give up on love?

79
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,640
And it has something to do
with my parents, right?

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll just take care of it for you.

81
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Xiaozi.

82
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
It's not as simple as you think.

83
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,040
How is it not that simple?
If I say I can take care of it, I will.

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
This is between me and Shancai.

85
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,800
It's none of your business.

86
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
None of my business?

87
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
What do you mean by that?

88
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,600
I finally decided
to support your relationship.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
Now you're just giving up.

90
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
How can you do this?

91
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,880
Fine.

92
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Even if I can't take care of it
or none of us can help you take care of it

93
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
and you have to break up with Shancai,

94
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,240
shouldn't you at least apologize to her
and explain it properly?

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,160
What does your family enterprise
crisis have to do with her?

96
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
It's not Shancai's fault.

97
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You can't let her leave just like that.

98
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,160
Gosh.

99
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Don't come here again.

100
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,800
Shancai. I'm sorry.

101
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,880
Something happened in my family.

102
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,520
I have to focus entirely

103
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,559
on helping the Daoming Group
get through this rough patch.

104
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,680
I can't be selfish

105
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,360
and pretend like my family is fine.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,640
But we agreed to face everything together.

107
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,280
We can all help you.

108
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,400
Our thoughts were too simple and immature.

109
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
I thought I could do that.

110
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,520
But I'm sorry, I can't.

111
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
I can't be selfish like you.

112
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
Fine.

113
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
I understand.

114
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,280
I apologize for the inconvenience.

115
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,200
Si.

116
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
You haven't eaten anything.

117
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Eat something. What do you want?

118
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,640
I'll buy it for you.

119
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,320
Tell me.

120
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Is that so?

121
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,200
Of course.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
However,

123
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,240
don't give this old woman a hard time.

124
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,640
Even though you're old,

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,520
you should still be able
to run a marathon.

126
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,160
You're making jokes again. What exactly do you want to have?

127
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,560
Is there anything
you can think of? Tell me.

128
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,680
There is.

129
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
What is it?

130
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,680
Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

131
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
All right.

132
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
I'll go buy it for you now.

133
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
No.

134
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll go and have it there myself.

135
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
Are you sure you want to leave?

136
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
Yes.

137
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,520
Don't you want to see Si
for the last time before you go?

138
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,640
He won't return to Shanghai for a while.

139
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,760
If you want to see him, now is the time.

140
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,960
I've already seen him once.

141
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,720
Will seeing him again...

142
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
make any difference?

143
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,520
I'm not sure either.

144
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I just don't want to see you
being so miserable.

145
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,720
Lei.

146
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,200
Thank you

147
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
for always staying by my side.

148
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,760
My feelings for you are beyond love.

149
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,040
You're like a friend and also a pet.

150
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,240
You're really special to me.

151
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,000
We should go.

152
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm bringing Shancai back to Shanghai.

153
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
What do you mean?

154
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,640
You don't deserve her love.

155
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,760
She's here by herself
because you abandoned her.

156
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,080
How can you call yourself her boyfriend?

157
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,400
If this is how you treat your girlfriend,

158
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,280
then I was wrong about you.

159
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
Shancai, let's go.

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Shancai!

161
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,440
Do you still remember
what you promised me?

162
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,080
If you can't promise her anything,

163
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,000
don't give her any more expectations.

164
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,680
Didn't you promise

165
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,200
we'll have hot pot together?

166
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,400
Lei.

167
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
I want to fulfill my last promise to him.

168
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,120
This should be our last date.

169
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,760
Let's spend a nice day in London
and promise not to argue.

170
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Okay.

171
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
It's the London Eye.

172
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,040
Now I can brag to Xiaoyou
that I've been to London when I get back.

173
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,560
Haven't you taken a look around
since you got here?

174
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,640
I'm not here for a vacation.

175
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,720
It's a good thing
my first time here is with you.

176
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,720
Do you want to ride it? The view is great.

177
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,800
I'll just look at it from here.

178
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,200
This is how I envisioned London.

179
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
It's snowing.

180
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Daoming Si.

181
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,880
There's something I need
to apologize to you for.

182
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,480
A thief stole the bracelet you gave me

183
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,680
on my first day in London.

184
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
That's okay.

185
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
Why does it matter?

186
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,360
I lost something you gave me.
Of course it matters.

187
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
What if I also

188
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,960
-return the meteor necklace to you?
-You can't do that.

189
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,200
Shancai.

190
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,640
Everything I gave you
since we got to know each other

191
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,080
is yours.

192
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,800
You can't give them back to me.

193
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Okay? Okay.

194
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,400
Give me your phone.

195
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,080
Why?

196
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,400
Just give it to me.

197
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,480
That guy, "I Call the Shots,"

198
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,720
has prepared to give you this gift
since a long time ago.

199
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,240
"Meteor Garden"? No. I want to place it here.

200
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,200
Your taste is really different
from normal people.

201
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,760
Don't you know that already?

202
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,400
I want to place it here.

203
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,240
Isn't it nice to place it over there?

204
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,720
This is my Meteor Garden.
I can put it wherever I want.

205
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,240
I think it's better here.

206
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
No, place it here.

207
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,960
-Give it to me. I'll move it.
-No.

208
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,320
Shancai.

209
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Si.

210
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,120
Ms. Yue.

211
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,680
You know Shancai?

212
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,480
She came to eat Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles before.

213
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,800
Hi, Ms. Yue.

214
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,640
Turns out the boy
you're looking for is Si.

215
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,400
Shancai, you found Si.

216
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,920
Si, do you know?

217
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,080
That day, when Shancai walked in,

218
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,600
she looked so tired and helpless.

219
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,320
But when she talked about

220
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
coming to London
to look for her boyfriend,

221
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,440
her eyes were full of love.

222
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm still so moved about it now.

223
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,040
Then are you here today to celebrate?

224
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,240
Celebrate your reunion in London?

225
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
Yes.

226
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,360
We're celebrating the best day
we've ever had together.

227
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,600
Ms. Yue.

228
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,600
Please give us the most sumptuous hot pot.

229
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,600
No problem.

230
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
Go and have a seat.

231
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,600
Here.

232
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
I made this sauce from my secret recipe.

233
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
It's not sold anywhere else.

234
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
Try it. I'm sure you'll like it.

235
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,320
It's really good.

236
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,520
It's really good.

237
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,600
I'm glad you like it.

238
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm so happy right now.

239
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,240
Si has a girlfriend already.

240
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,400
It's my treat today.

241
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,560
-Ms. Yue.
-Yes.

242
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
You can't treat us.

243
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,440
I asked Shancai to eat hot pot with me.

244
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,600
It's my treat.

245
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,760
Then I'll treat you next time.

246
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,880
There's no next time.

247
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
You're leaving London so soon?

248
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,400
I'm going back to Shanghai tomorrow.

249
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,640
Gosh. That's such a shame.

250
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,200
I won't treat you then.
His family is rich anyway.

251
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,280
Enjoy your quality time together.

252
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,360
Take your time and enjoy yourselves.

253
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,960
There are so many delicious foods. Which one should I try first?

254
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,600
I'll have some meat first.

255
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,600
This steak is so delicious.
How can it be this good?

256
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm so happy today.

257
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
Every time I see you eat,
I feel like the food tastes even better.

258
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,240
They really taste good.

259
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
It's so delicious.

260
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,640
I really like watching you eat. It feels like everything
is especially delicious

261
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,960
when you're eating it.

262
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,480
Because it's so nice to eat good food.

263
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,880
Is that so?

264
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,480
Yes.

265
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,160
Try it yourself.

266
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,280
Okay.

267
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,600
Is it good?

268
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,600
It's really good.

269
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,960
Why didn't I notice how good
these tasted before?

270
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,880
Because you didn't care
about these things before.

271
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
You're right.

272
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,480
I didn't care
about a lot of things before.

273
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,760
I didn't care about what tastes good,

274
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,960
which type of weather is best for a date,

275
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,280
whether that person likes me,

276
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,080
whether the person who likes me is happy.

277
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,120
Or whether someone is thinking of me
and missing me.

278
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,240
Until I met that girl called Shancai.

279
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,440
Daoming Si!

280
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,680
That's when I realized
I care about so many things.

281
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
What about now?

282
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,600
Do you still care about her?

283
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,600
I care about her so much.

284
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,080
But I don't know
how to protect her anymore.

285
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
All right.

286
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,080
Stop it.

287
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,600
This is so unlike you.

288
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,240
Daoming Si.

289
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
Please...

290
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,320
Can you give me a bad boy expression?

291
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,040
Let's go back to when I first met you.

292
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,680
That self-centered,

293
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,000
God's gift to mankind,

294
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,240
most arrogant

295
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,120
and the coolest Daoming Si.

296
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
All right.

297
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,480
So that's what you like.

298
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,320
You asked for it.

299
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,720
Yes, I did.

300
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,400
Dong Shancai. You're a stupid girl.

301
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,120
I command you
to finish everything in this hot pot.

302
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,360
Serve me some food and a bowl of soup too.

303
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
You're so annoying.

304
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
Why should I listen to you?

305
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,480
Nonsense. Do whatever I say.

306
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,280
I can't do it.

307
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
You can't do it?

308
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Do you want to die?

309
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,320
Sorry.

310
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
"Sorry"?

311
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
Are you apologizing?

312
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
You can make that assumption.

313
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,760
-If apologies work,
-If apologies work,

314
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,600
-why do we need the police?
-why do we need the police?

315
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,920
It's so funny.

316
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
I've got tears in my eyes
from laughing so hard.

317
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,400
-Ms. Yue.
-Yes?

318
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Yes?

319
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,680
I want to have
an Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles.

320
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,680
Sure. I'll make some now.

321
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,160
Ms. Yue.

322
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,280
The creator of Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles is right in front of me.

323
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,480
So she is the one.

324
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,400
I want to eat the noodles she makes for the last time.

325
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,640
For the last time?

326
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,159
Ms. Yue.

327
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,639
Try it.

328
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,000
This is Shancai's Eight Treasure
Spicy Noodles.

329
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,960
This kind of flavor is her specialty.

330
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,320
Okay.

331
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,960
The taste is so unique.

332
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
It should be sweet and spicy.

333
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,120
How come it also

334
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,480
tastes sour and a little bitter?

335
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,160
Did you add pineapples?

336
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,160
Yes.

337
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
How did you think of that? I...

338
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,600
Based on my personal experiences.

339
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,240
Maybe that's the kind of memory
I gave Shancai.

340
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,160
Ms. Yue.

341
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,480
Can you stop selling
Eight Treasure Spicy Noodles?

342
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,720
I can't handle just hearing the name.

343
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,680
Why?

344
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
Because starting tomorrow,

345
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,000
I'll be leaving this girl.

346
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,760
That's such a shame.

347
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,720
Let's eat.

348
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,400
Are you cold?

349
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
I feel like

350
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,320
this day went by too fast.

351
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,600
As fast as the blink of an eye.

352
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,320
As slow as a lifetime.

353
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,360
It would be nice

354
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,240
if we can spend our lifetime like this.

355
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,360
Then let's make a deal.

356
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,320
We'll spend each day like this
in our next lifetime, okay?

357
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,200
It's almost dawn.

358
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,240
You should head home.

359
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,480
I'll walk with you.

360
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
Okay.

361
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,160
London bridge is falling down

362
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,800
Falling down

363
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,240
Falling down

364
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,000
London bridge is falling down

365
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,880
Falling down Falling down

366
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,320
If you continue singing,
London Bridge will really fall down.

367
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,080
Then let it fall.

368
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I don't care even if it does.

369
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,160
Well...

370
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,480
Let's go our separate ways here.

371
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay.

372
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,160
You...

373
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,760
Take a good care of yourself.

374
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,600
Shouldn't I be the one telling you that?

375
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,640
Go.

376
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
You go first.

377
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,880
I want to see you leaving first.

378
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
You go first.

379
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,320
All right.

380
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,680
Then I'll go first.

381
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,040
Daoming Si!

382
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,280
Daoming Si!

383
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,240
Why are you here?

384
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,120
Didn't you promise not to see Si anymore?

385
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,480
And that I won't be seeing you again.

386
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,120
Can you let me see Daoming Si again?

387
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,600
I really miss him. Subtitle translation by Coleen Chua
