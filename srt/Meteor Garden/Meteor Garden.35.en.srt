00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,800
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 35

3
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,479
Shancai, why are you here?

4
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,800
Aren't you off today?

5
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,880
I just happened to pass by.

6
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
I'm telling you.

7
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
There are so many orders today.

8
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,640
I can't handle it on my own.

9
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,320
Our boss went out earlier.

10
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
Do you still have a hangover?

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,760
Come and help me for a while.

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
Okay, sure.

13
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
Go get changed.

14
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
Okay.

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,480
Shancai.

16
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,240
No matter what happens
to my family in the future,

17
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,960
don't disappear on your own again.

18
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
I'm happy that you and Daoming Si
are together.

19
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,320
And I'm even happier to hear
about how you feel.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Thank you...

22
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,960
for not giving up.

23
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Xiaoyou?

24
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
Why are you here?

25
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,520
I was waiting for you.

26
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,440
You just stood here and waited?

27
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,040
It seems you like to surprise people.

28
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,040
I'm sorry for doing this so suddenly.

29
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
It's all right.

30
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,440
What if I didn't come home?

31
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Then I would have left.

32
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
Actually, I'm here to apologize to you.

33
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
Apologize to me?

34
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm sorry about yesterday.

35
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,920
It's okay. I'm used to it.

36
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,080
If I worried about these things,
then I'd be really busy.

37
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,120
I thought you'd be mad.

38
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
It turns out you don't care.

39
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,720
I thought I already caught your attention.

40
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Xiaoyou.

41
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,520
Do you know

42
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,800
why I never dated any girls
in Mingde University?

43
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Because they're too close.
So it'd be too irritating for you?

44
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,680
That's right. You're very smart.

45
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,120
You're Shancai's friend.
Shancai is my good friend's girlfriend.

46
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,680
That means you're even
more irritating than Mingde's girls.

47
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680
Sorry to be so blunt.

48
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,240
However, I think we'd be good as friends,
don't you think?

49
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
It's getting late.

50
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,880
You should go home.
It might be dangerous later.

51
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
I want it all.

52
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,640
Last time, you said we can go on dates,
kiss and hug, right?

53
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
You have to keep your word.

54
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Xiaoyou.

55
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
When did you become so bold?

56
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
You're brave enough to say these things.

57
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
You weren't like that before.

58
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
If I don't learn to say these things,

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,960
how can I like someone like you?

60
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,200
-But--
-Arrange your schedule then let me know.

61
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,480
Sorry to disturb you today.
I'll leave now. Bye.

62
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
Don't you have anything better to do?

63
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,640
Welcome home. Shanghai welcomes you.

64
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,400
Hey. Bottoms up.

65
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,640
-I agree.
-Yes.

66
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,040
I just got back
and you're treating me like this.

67
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,600
Why didn't you let us see you off?

68
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,160
I felt so guilty all these months.

69
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,320
One or two days in a few months
is more like it.

70
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
One day.

71
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
Why are you taking turns
with Si to play cool? You feel like you're the only cool one.

72
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,800
Playing it cool? I was born cool.

73
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,520
Yes, you're the coolest.

74
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,560
-The coolest ever.
-Cool.

75
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,520
Are you as cool as me? Hey.

76
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,200
How's your family situation?
Do you need any help?

77
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,720
It's fine.

78
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,600
They told me to just study hard
and not to worry.

79
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,480
So, are you willing
to come back to us now?

80
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
I never left. You never left?

81
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,160
Then drink some more.

82
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
-Pour more.
-Here.

83
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,560
Full glass.

84
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
-Fill it up.
-Finish it all.

85
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,520
-That's fine.
-That's enough.

86
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Drink it.

87
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Two seconds. Countdown.

88
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
One.

89
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
Two.

90
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,920
You took too long.

91
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,880
One more.

92
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,800
Then let's toast to our friendship.

93
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
Okay. Here.

94
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
-Come on. Cheers.
-Cheers.

95
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
Cheers.

96
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Do you know?

97
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,280
If you don't, then ask me.

98
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
I don't know but I don't want to ask you.

99
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,240
Why don't you have any curiosity
towards your friend?

100
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,720
I really don't.

101
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I don't care. Ask me.

102
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,040
Ask me how I'm doing lately.

103
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,760
-You're doing great.
-Who told you that?

104
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,560
-Aren't you doing great?
-I'm doing great.

105
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,560
All right.

106
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
He played me.

107
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Lei.

108
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,680
Just do what he wants,

109
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
or else he'll make a fuss all night.

110
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,200
We all won't be able to sleep.

111
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,440
Si, I told Lei as soon as it happened.

112
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,280
Not just Ximen and Meizuo,
even Xiaozi told me about it.

113
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Three people. Three versions.

114
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
I don't care.

115
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,240
My version is the original one.

116
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,880
And I want to tell you myself.

117
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
All right.

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
Si, how are you and Shancai?

119
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,280
Shancai and I are officially together.

120
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
All right.

121
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,800
We're together now.

122
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
That's great!

123
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,920
Si.

124
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
Congratulations.

125
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,200
This is great. F4 is now back to normal.

126
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm so moved.

127
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,600
Cut the crap. Let's make a toast!

128
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,200
Let's toast to Si officially being taken.
What do you think?

129
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,520
Not bad.

130
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
Come on. Cheers.

131
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

132
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Lei.

133
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,520
When did you come back to Shanghai?

134
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,240
How's your family situation?

135
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,080
How are you?

136
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,960
Why are you here?

137
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,880
Yesterday.

138
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,520
Good.

139
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,800
Because I want to come here.

140
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
Why are you here?

141
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,000
The same reason as you.

142
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,320
It's so good to have you back.

143
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,800
What are your plans?

144
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
To continue preparing for the recital.

145
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,560
Really?

146
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,360
That's great.
I'd love to hear you play the violin.

147
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,520
Is that so?

148
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Yes.

149
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Shancai.

150
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,720
You and Si are officially together, right?

151
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,240
I think it's a very good start.

152
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Yes.

153
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,960
It just turned out this way.

154
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
Actually, I have mixed feelings about it.

155
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm a little happy and a little sad.

156
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,160
On one hand, I hope things
between you and Si go smoothly.

157
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,400
On the other hand, you're special to me.

158
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
Special?

159
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,800
To put it bluntly,

160
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,400
you're like my pet.

161
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Pet?

162
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Never mind.

163
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
What do I expect you to say?

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,120
You should be happy.

165
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
We all should be happy.

166
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,400
You're my good friend's girlfriend.

167
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,440
This way,

168
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,200
we can be friends forever.

169
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
I'll go to practice now.

170
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,160
Lei.

171
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,480
You know I liked you before, right?

172
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,120
Goodbye, Shancai.

173
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,920
I was able to easily blurt out something
I've had a hard time saying before.

174
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm happy when I heard Lei say,
"friends forever."

175
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
My first love has ended.

176
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,520
This is the moment when love
became friendship.

177
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,520
NEW FRIEND

178
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,760
XIAOYOU

179
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
How are you lately, Master Ximen?

180
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm all right. Still the same as before.

181
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,440
I guess so.

182
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Since your dad retired,

183
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,240
you've been hosting
the tea ceremonies on your own.

184
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
That's so great. Unlike me.

185
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What's the matter?

186
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,800
You've always participated
in the exhibits, right?

187
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
I only participated.

188
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I wasn't responsible for a whole project.

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,080
I just needed to take care of my part.

190
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
It's different now.

191
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,080
Whether it's a major or a minor thing,

192
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,760
I have to put in a lot of effort in them.

193
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,960
And there are so many details
to take care of.

194
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,600
I'm so stressed out.

195
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,000
You're a detailed person,
so you wouldn't have a problem.

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,200
I don't even have time for dates.

197
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,280
I have to go after finishing my drink.

198
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,160
What do you plan to do with Xiaoyou?

199
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,520
What can I do?

200
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,640
I think she's quite courageous,

201
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,680
but you won't do anything to her, right?

202
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,000
Am I crazy?

203
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not as brave as Si.
I don't want to get Shancai's flying kick.

204
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,400
Girls are like drinks at a bar.

205
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,880
Compared to the strong ones,

206
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
the fruity ones are easy to drink,
but we'd end up with a terrible hangover.

207
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,280
You've had a variety of drinks.

208
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,920
What kind of drink is Xiaoyou?

209
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
Harsh words don't seem to be effective.

210
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
I know she's forcing herself.

211
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,080
But she keeps going forward
and chasing after me.

212
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,560
Never hitting the brakes
even when she's speeding.

213
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,000
This girl is really devoted. Be careful.

214
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,880
You don't have to worry at all.

215
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm not the least bit interested
in that kind of girl.

216
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,720
Is that so?

217
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,480
I think you've become warmhearted.

218
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,080
You see even fewer women now.

219
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,800
Meizuo, don't you have a date?

220
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
I should go.

221
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,160
It's hard to date older women.

222
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,319
You're always on call
and under strict supervision.

223
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,800
That's why dating is so much fun.

224
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,160
Age and love are not something
to worry about.

225
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,599
Meizuo, do you still like Caina?

226
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,880
She's a goddess, indeed.
You can worship her if you want.

227
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,840
But don't forget the ordinary humans
around you.

228
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
Ximen.

229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,320
True love requires responsibility.

230
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,200
When it's necessary,
you have to make sacrifices

231
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,840
for that person's future.

232
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
In the 20 years I've known you,

233
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,040
this is the first time you've used
the word, "sacrifice."

234
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Caina is really incredible.

235
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
She taught you about sacrifice.

236
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,360
I have to go now.

237
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,720
Hey, handsome. It's boring to drink alone.

238
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Do you want to have drinks together?

239
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,400
Sorry. I can't today. Maybe next time.

240
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,960
DAOMING SI

241
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
I wonder what he's doing now.

242
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,000
I want to see him but I can't.

243
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,200
It was better when we weren't
officially dating.

244
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,480
No.

245
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,440
What am I doing?
Why am I thinking about nonsense again?

246
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,400
DAOMING SI

247
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,680
DAOMING SI

248
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,880
Hello? Shancai.

249
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,880
Hello? Shancai.
Why aren't you saying anything?

250
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,240
-Who is it?
-What's the matter?

251
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
I'm going there now.

252
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,640
The thief didn't succeed tonight.
He might strike again.

253
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,040
If there's anything suspicious,
call the police immediately.

254
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
Of course, we'll tighten
our security around the area too.

255
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,600
Please lock your doors.

256
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,600
Call the police.

257
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
Call the police if anything happens.

258
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,080
Where's my phone?

259
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,160
My phone.

260
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,520
What's happening? Is the thief back?

261
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,000
He's so smug.

262
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,800
All right.

263
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,120
I'll punish him. I'll destroy him.

264
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,600
Hey.

265
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,360
Why are you so violent?

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,960
Daoming Si?

267
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
Are you thinking clearly now? It's the middle of the night.

268
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,720
Why are you here?

269
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
Silly girl. You had me worried.

270
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,520
If I catch that thief,
I'd surely cut him in half.

271
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
It's a good thing you're here.

272
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,880
I feel safe now.

273
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll find you a nice place.

274
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,600
Don't stay in such a dangerous
area anymore.

275
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
There's no need.

276
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,200
Even though it's nothing great,

277
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,600
but it's my house.

278
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,600
I want to live here no matter what.

279
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,760
Thank you, Daoming Si. Who lives next to you?

280
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,200
Nobody, it's empty.

281
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Don't worry.

282
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
Do you want to stay at my house tonight?

283
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,680
There's no need. I'll just stay here.

284
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,800
Okay. I'll stay with you then.

285
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,760
No.

286
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,560
You can't sleep here. Go home.

287
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Why? It's not like
we haven't done this before.

288
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,240
No. Go home.

289
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,280
Go home and sleep there.

290
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
Are you sure?

291
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,320
-Go home.
-I'm worried about you.

292
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,240
I'll be fine.

293
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,520
-Don't worry.
-Are you sure?

294
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,720
-I'm sure.
-Lock the door.

295
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,920
Okay. All right.

296
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
What are you planning to do?

297
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,920
If the thief comes again,
wouldn't it be dangerous?

298
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,040
What did Daoming Si say?
He must be really worried.

299
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
Yes.

300
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
So?

301
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,240
He asked me to go with him
and sleep at his house.

302
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,520
But how can I do that?

303
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,120
Why not? He's your boyfriend.

304
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,480
That is true,

305
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,360
-but...
-Shancai.

306
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,200
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it with Daoming Si?

307
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,160
-Done what?
-Have sex.

308
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,600
Xiaoyou, what are you saying?

309
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,080
You haven't?

310
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,880
I thought liking someone means
giving him everything you can, right?

311
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,600
I think it's a natural thing.

312
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Xiaoyou.

313
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,960
This topic is too much for me.
I can't take it.

314
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,840
Shancai, you're the innocent type.
I'm not.

315
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,000
How can you not be that type?

316
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm different now.

317
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm not the old Jiang Xiaoyou anymore.

318
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,480
Now, I'm full of fighting spirit.

319
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,160
Xiaoyou.

320
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
I'm very scared of your fighting spirit.

321
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,200
What did Ximen do to you?

322
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,240
Hello?

323
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,800
Do you want to come over?

324
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Okay.

325
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,160
Shancai, something came up. I have to go.

326
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
If our boss asks, just tell her I'm off.

327
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,760
Why so sudden?

328
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,160
-Okay, go. I'll take care of this.
-Okay.

329
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,840
Shancai.

330
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,440
Do you think this lipstick color suits me?

331
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,600
I think this suits you better.

332
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,080
Okay. I'll use the Coral Fauve color then.

333
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,840
This lipstick brand
is very popular lately.

334
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,520
Do I look strange?

335
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,040
Not really.

336
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,160
-But--
-Shancai, let's talk next time.

337
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
I'll get going. Bye.

338
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,080
Shancai.

339
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,280
Isn't the weather really nice today?
Even the air smells sweet.

340
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,960
I really like it.

341
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm so happy today.

342
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,200
Hey, Xiaoyou.

343
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,840
Don't you want to get changed first?

344
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,240
That's right.

345
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,920
Is it because of the lipstick?

346
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,320
I think Xiaoyou seems really happy
and pretty today.

347
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
The air around her
seems to be a light pink hue.

348
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,240
It seems like she's floating.

349
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,320
Si has a bad temper and can be rash.

350
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,280
But he's all right.

351
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,160
Shancai is the same.

352
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,960
Maybe Shancai can only date Si.

353
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,880
That's right. They really suit each other.

354
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,840
We've only been talking
about Si and Shancai.

355
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
Shouldn't we talk about us?

356
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,600
All right.

357
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,560
How's the milk tea shop doing?

358
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,680
Not bad.

359
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,360
Do you have any new drinks lately?

360
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,120
Yes, it's called...

361
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,760
It's called...

362
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,440
It's fine.

363
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,480
I'll just go and try it some time.

364
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
Miss, "You're Most Beautiful Tonight."

365
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,960
That's the name of this dessert.
This gentleman ordered it for you.

366
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Don't hesitate.

367
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
Open it.

368
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
1573.

369
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,040
Does it mean "Our feelings are so true"?

370
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,320
No.

371
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,320
That's my room number.

372
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,400
That's strange.
I thought nobody's staying next door.

373
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,840
Did someone move in?

374
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
He's so clumsy.

375
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,720
The key is still in the door.

376
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
Hello. Is anybody home?

377
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I'm Dong Shancai from next door.

378
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,760
You left your key in the door.

379
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,200
Is anybody home?

380
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,840
I didn't forget it.

381
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,800
I left it especially for you. Why are you here?

382
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,400
I rented this place.

383
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,360
What?

384
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
You're staying next door?

385
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,800
I'm on a secret mission.

386
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
-I need an empty house.
-Secret--

387
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,640
I'm protecting a very precious little pig.

388
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,520
She might be attacked anytime.

389
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
I have to protect her in secret.

390
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,840
Who's a pig?

391
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,880
I didn't say it was you.
Why are you so mad?

392
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,120
There are so many empty houses. Why are you renting the one next door?

393
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,080
The location is good.
It's very convenient.

394
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,840
If your family finds out,
then will the mission fail?

395
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Don't worry.

396
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,720
The landlady won't speak a word.

397
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,160
How come?

398
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,960
Did you stuff her mouth with cloth?

399
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
You're really a very stupid pig.

400
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,800
I have my ways.

401
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,360
Money. I'm sure you used money.

402
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
You're exactly the type.

403
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,760
Or did you threaten her?

404
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,640
Can you let me finish first?

405
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Listen.

406
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,800
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

407
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,800
She fell for my charms, of course.

408
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,520
That's why she rented the house to me.

409
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,680
So? Do you feel proud?

410
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,000
This handsome guy
is not just your boyfriend.

411
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
He's even your neighbor now.

412
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,120
Why are you renting such a small house?

413
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,920
If I'm a very stupid pig,
you're the stupidest pig ever!

414
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,240
Are you crazy?

415
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,600
Don't rent the place anymore.

416
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,960
When the stupid pig encounters danger,
I have to be there right away.

417
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,400
Don't you get it?

418
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,440
Of course I know
that you're worried about me.

419
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,880
That's why you rented the place next door.

420
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,840
But this type of move is too shocking.

421
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,360
Why are you staring at me?

422
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,920
Your boyfriend is really handsome, right?

423
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,040
You and your landlady
seem to have similar tastes.

424
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,360
Would you like a drink?

425
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,000
Do you need a shower first?

426
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,400
Relax.

427
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,360
I wonder if Daoming Si
is already sleeping.

428
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,200
The ceiling's so low.

429
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,360
There's a damp smell in here.

430
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,160
How can it be comfortable to stay here?

431
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,920
So Shancai grew up
in this kind of environment.

432
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,640
So now we're the same.

433
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm also breathing the air
Shancai's breathing.

434
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,960
All the challenges we faced
didn't break us apart,

435
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,320
but pulled us closer instead.

436
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,040
Do people really place more value

437
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,960
on a love that was once lost
then found again?

438
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,720
Should I go to Shancai's place now?

439
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,840
Never mind. It's already late.

440
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,760
She'll get the wrong idea again.

441
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,640
She'll think I want to do
something with her.

442
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
Actually, I really do.

443
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,640
I thought I had to force myself
to enter his world.

444
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,640
I never thought he'd be willing
to come into my world.

445
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,400
I'm so touched.

446
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I want to go there now and tell him that.

447
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,960
But...

448
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,000
if I really knocked on his door,

449
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,840
will he think that I'm a very easy girl?

450
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Don't force yourself. You're not that type of girl.

451
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,640
I'm not interested in a girl
that's shaking all over.

452
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,840
Treasure yourself. I treasure...

453
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I treasure my feelings for you,
that's why I came here with you.

454
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,280
As long as it makes you happy,

455
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm willing to do anything.

456
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,240
It's normal to be nervous the first time.

457
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,000
Please don't mind it.

458
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,480
I won't be nervous again next time.

459
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,360
Ximen.

460
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,320
Please give me some time
and have patience.

461
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
I originally just wanted to scare you.

462
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,480
I never thought
you'd be willing to go through it.

463
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,800
You're not the Xiaoyou I know at all.

464
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,760
But why can't people
who like each other be together?

465
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,400
Xiaoyou, are you sure you want to do this?

466
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,320
I can go through with it.

467
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,960
And then what?

468
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,200
But I'll surely regret it
if I don't follow my heart.

469
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,520
There's always regret in love.

470
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,240
So you also had regrets in love?

471
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,680
That's none of your business.

472
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,800
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

473
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,440
I've already paid for the room.

474
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,240
You can stay to watch the view or leave.

475
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,680
It's up to you. Ximen.

476
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,240
Why can't people
who like each other be together?

477
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,840
Why can't people
who like each other be together?

478
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,920
Why can't people
who like each other be together?
