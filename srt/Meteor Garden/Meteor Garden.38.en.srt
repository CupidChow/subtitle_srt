A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 38

3
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
Goodbye.

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
To me,

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
the "Once in a Lifetime"
for me and Xiaogeng

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,280
was the moment she turned around and left.

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
You're hurting yourself this way.

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,160
Until now,

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
I still can't resist thinking

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,120
that if I went over

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
and hugged Xiaogeng tightly then,

12
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
what would happen to us

13
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,480
right now?

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
Xiaogeng.

15
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
I shouldn't have stood you up.

17
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Would I be able to find it

18
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
without knowing what it is?

19
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,880
Should I give up now?

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,440
I've been to almost
all the buildings in Lujiazui.

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,560
Only a few are left

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
with a view of the Oriental Pearl Tower

23
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
and are accessible at 5:00 a.m.

24
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
What did she want me to see?

25
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm still not sure at this point.

26
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,800
Is that the one?

27
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,360
No way, right?

28
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
It's so unimaginable.

29
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,520
Ximen.

30
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,600
I think I found it.

31
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
I found it.

32
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,160
Ximen.

33
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,880
I have something important to tell you.

34
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,520
You have to see me today, okay?

35
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,760
I'll wait for you at the third stop
of Lujiazui Metro Station.

36
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
You have to be there.

37
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
Okay?

38
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
Someone's inside. Is it a thief?

39
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,640
Or Daoming Si's bodyguards?

40
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
No.

41
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,520
Ms. Zhuang already took care
of the bodyguards. No matter who it is,
I have to make a move first.

42
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,000
Go away!

43
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Get out of here!

44
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
What are you doing? Why are you waving that around?

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,160
Mom.

46
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,160
Thank goodness, it's you.
I thought it was a thief. I was so scared.

47
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,760
It's a good thing
that I have a strong heart.

48
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
Or you'd have scared me to death.

49
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,320
Mom, why are you here?

50
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,680
I called you last night,
but you didn't answer.

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
I wasn't home last night.

52
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
You weren't home?

53
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
Where did you go?

54
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
I spent the night
at Daoming Si's house last night.

55
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Daoming Si's house?

56
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
You two were all alone

57
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,760
and full of passion.

58
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,640
No.

59
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
Not that.

60
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,520
It's not what you think.

61
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Tell me.

62
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,200
Last night, did you and Daoming Si...

63
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,200
I mean, did you two seal the deal?

64
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,680
No.

65
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Mom.

66
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
Don't you trust your daughter?

67
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Yes, I spent the night
at his house last night.

68
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,480
-But I--
-But you're still

69
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,840
pure and innocent, right?

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,400
Mom.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,720
Actually, he and I

72
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,040
are dating secretly. We can't let his mom know.

73
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,160
What?

74
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,040
That wench still doesn't know?

75
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,240
How much more does she want you to suffer?

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,080
Daoming Feng is really crazy.

77
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,919
There must be something wrong in her head.

78
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,440
Where is she? Tell her to come out.

79
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
I want to talk to her.

80
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,520
Mom, stop it. She's not in Shanghai.

81
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,760
That's good.

82
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,520
Or else, I'd give her a piece of my mind.

83
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,520
Mom, how did you find time to visit me?

84
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,760
You know, that idea of yours
is really great.

85
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Our squid business is doing really well.

86
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,000
Business is booming. We're so busy. Your dad and I both have
high hopes for our future.

87
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
I initially didn't have time to come here.

88
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
But I really missed you.

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
I was curious how you're doing all alone.

90
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,840
So I came here today just to see you.

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
-Mom, wait here.
-Okay.

92
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,080
-This is for you.
-What is it?

93
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,840
Mom.

94
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
I know it's hard to do business.

95
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,920
But skin care is also very important.

96
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,080
Look at you.

97
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,440
There are fine lines around your eyes.

98
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
Are you saying that I look old?

99
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,920
All right. I know
you're concerned about me.

100
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,920
Mom. I'm fine here.

101
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,520
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,080
Is Daoming Si being nice to you?

103
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,440
Did he do anything bad to you?

104
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
No. He's quite nice to me.

105
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,640
That's good. I don't need to worry then.

106
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,160
This time, you seem different from before.

107
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,640
You're all grown up. You've matured.

108
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,520
Come on.

109
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,840
This is so nice.

110
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,600
And now for our weather report,
starting on Wednesday,

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,520
due to strong winds from the north,

112
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,600
most of the East China region
will experience cold waves.

113
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,560
EAST CHINA REGION TO EXPERIENCE
COLD WAVES. PLEASE KEEP WARM.

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,320
When the cold waves come,

115
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,040
and the weather continues to be this bad,

116
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,000
it would be impossible for him to come.

117
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,720
So...

118
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
today might be our only chance.

119
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,600
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is not accessible at this time.

120
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
Please try again later.

121
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,160
Hello, Xiaoyou?

122
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,480
You haven't come
to the milk tea shop lately.

123
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Did something happen?

124
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Shancai, did you see Ximen?

125
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,280
I need to talk to him.

126
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,160
It's Ximen again.

127
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Xiaoyou, you...

128
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,320
I haven't seen F4 the whole day.

129
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,640
Then can you ask Daoming Si

130
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,960
if Ximen is with him?

131
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,920
What's the matter?
Why do you sound so anxious?

132
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
I have to see him today.

133
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240
Why?

134
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,120
Just help me look for him first.

135
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,480
Xiaoyou.

136
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,120
For the past few weeks, you've been
keeping a lot of things from me.

137
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,600
I'm really worried, you know?

138
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,160
Shancai.

139
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,560
I know what I'm doing.

140
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Today

141
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
is a very important day for me.

142
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,680
If "Once in a Lifetime" really exists,

143
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,360
I don't want to miss it.

144
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Shancai...

145
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,680
I know you're worried.

146
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,400
I won't let myself get hurt.

147
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,760
Trust me.

148
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
All right.

149
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
I'll help you look for him.

150
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,400
Really?

151
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,720
Where should we meet?

152
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,520
I heard from Daoming Si

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,400
that they're going
to an art gallery here in Shanghai

154
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
for a symposium.

155
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,680
Let's meet there.
I think we'd find them there.

156
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,240
Okay. See you later.

157
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
Bye.

158
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,840
Any progress?

159
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
Still no news from him.

160
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
Xiaoyou.

161
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,120
Do you really need to see Ximen tonight?

162
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
We're going out the day after tomorrow.

163
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,480
Do you want to go with us then?

164
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,520
If possible, I want to see him tonight.

165
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,880
Why must it be tonight?

166
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,400
Because the cold waves are coming.

167
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,160
Cold waves?

168
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,120
Do you want Ximen to keep you warm?

169
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,600
Meizuo.

170
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Stop teasing Xiaoyou.

171
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,800
All right.

172
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,880
I just want Xiaoyou to relax.

173
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
Look at her knitted brows.

174
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,440
Ximen is not here yet,
but you'll have gone old

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
from waiting like this.

176
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,600
Thank you, Meizuo.

177
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm fine.

178
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,080
Actually, you can go home first.

179
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,040
I can wait for him by myself.

180
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,520
All right.

181
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,320
I mean all right.

182
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,600
We'll wait with you until Ximen arrives.

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,160
Xiaoyou.

184
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
It's all right.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,360
We'll wait with you.

186
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,560
It's only 8:00 p.m. anyway.

187
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,000
This stupid girl
can't even fix her own problems.

188
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,040
Yet she's worried about other people.

189
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,760
Hey.

190
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,160
You three.

191
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,760
It's past midnight now.

192
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,880
Ximen is still not here.

193
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,599
Call and tell him to hurry up.

194
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,359
Lei, you call him.

195
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,680
Meizuo, you call him.
See if he's at the bar.

196
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,680
I called the bar earlier. He's not there.

197
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
What are you doing?

198
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
Help me look for him.

199
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,280
Okay, fine. Don't be mad.

200
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is not accessible at this time.

201
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,960
Please try again later.

202
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Ximen, it's past midnight.

203
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
You're still not here.

204
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,800
What's going on?

205
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,680
Listen.

206
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,800
We won't leave until you get here.

207
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,240
And if you don't arrive soon,

208
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,320
we can't be friends anymore.

209
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,920
Because Shancai will kill us all.

210
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,760
We will all be dead.
See you in the next life.

211
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,680
Is that good enough?

212
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,000
Xiaoyou.

213
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,480
It'll be all right.

214
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,520
Please.

215
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,400
Thank you for the lesson.

216
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,960
I'll practice it when I get home.

217
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,080
Ximen.

218
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
When we last saw each other,

219
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
you were still in high school.

220
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,120
You're all grown up now.

221
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
How have you been?

222
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,920
Thank you for your concern.

223
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm fine.

224
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,320
Well, despite all challenges in life.

225
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,160
Life is full of ups and downs indeed.

226
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
You should be happy about it.

227
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,040
If life only goes smoothly,

228
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
that means you'll never grow up.

229
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,960
Thanks for your concern.

230
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,480
Ximen, where have you been the whole day?

231
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,080
Ximen, if you don't come now...

232
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,760
Never mind. I'll just sleep
in the coffee shop.

233
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,880
I regret not bringing
my sleeping bag with me.

234
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
Ximen, it's past midnight.

235
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,560
You're still not here.

236
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,880
What's going on?

237
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,480
We won't leave until you get here.

238
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,760
And if you don't arrive soon,

239
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,840
we can't be friends anymore.

240
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Because Shancai will kill us all.

241
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,520
We will all be dead.
See you in the next life.

242
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,040
Ximen.

243
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
I have something important to tell you.

244
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
You have to see me today, okay?

245
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,400
Hey.

246
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
Based on our height difference,

247
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,440
isn't it uncomfortable
for you to sleep like this?

248
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
It is.

249
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
But I like it.

250
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,320
Xiaoyou.

251
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
We'll just find Ximen tomorrow, okay?

252
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
That's right.

253
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,520
When we find him tomorrow,
I'll surely beat him up for you.

254
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,640
And I'll force him to call you.

255
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Sorry, everyone.

256
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,560
I made you wait with me until now.

257
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,520
Because I...

258
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
I'm too impulsive.

259
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Let's go.

260
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,160
It's all right, Xiaoyou.

261
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,280
I'll surely find Ximen with you tomorrow.

262
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,120
Ximen.

263
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,320
Who do you think you are?

264
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,840
We've waited for you all night.

265
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,760
You were gone the whole day.
Where did you go?

266
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,160
We were all just waiting for you.

267
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,880
Do you think you're that important?

268
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,480
Am I not important?

269
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,840
Then I'll get going.

270
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,040
Get back here.

271
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
-What are you doing?
-I want to beat you up.

272
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
-Cut it out.
-Where did you go? Tell us.

273
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,160
Let Xiaoyou speak to him.

274
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,920
Even though I told you
I won't bother you again,

275
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,440
I think you have a right to know.

276
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
Even if you treat me
like a stranger starting tomorrow,

277
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,960
today, you have to do what I tell you.

278
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
What do you want?

279
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,480
Give me a chance

280
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,560
to show you what Xiaogeng
wanted you to see then.

281
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,000
It seems like the problem is solved.

282
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,560
I'm leaving.

283
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm going with you.

284
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,440
That's great. It's still dark.
We still have a chance.

285
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,200
The elevators are not working
at this hour.

286
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,920
We can only take the stairs
to the rooftop.

287
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
What?

288
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,960
There's no time to waste.

289
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,360
Do you want to have more regrets?

290
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,720
We have to hurry.
There are about ten more floors to go.

291
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,960
Are you all right?

292
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
Can you still go on?

293
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm fine.

294
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
There's no time.

295
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,760
Why don't you go ahead?

296
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,520
I think it's almost time.

297
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,600
I searched all over

298
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,760
before I found this building.

299
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,200
I remember you told me

300
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,880
that Xiaogeng asked you to come

301
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,560
during this season, at this specific time.

302
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,720
At first, I didn't get it.

303
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,640
It was until yesterday morning

304
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,800
when I saw the news about the cold waves.

305
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,440
Then I knew

306
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,680
that if you miss the timing,

307
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
she would never have a chance to tell you

308
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,280
what she wanted to say.

309
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Look over there.

310
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,880
XIMEN BUILDING, MY BELOVED

311
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,200
The words on the building in front

312
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,120
will disappear temporarily

313
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,760
for three minutes

314
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,400
due to the sun's refraction.

315
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

316
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,040
What an idiot.

317
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,440
She asked me to come so early
in the morning just for this.

318
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,040
She's so silly.

319
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,360
She's really silly.

320
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,560
XIMEN, MY BELOVED

321
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,280
Hey.

322
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,320
After waiting for Ximen,
we're now waiting for Xiaoyou.

323
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,200
We had dinner and now breakfast.

324
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,080
How long do we have to wait?

325
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
Go home if you're tired.

326
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,280
Xiaoyou is my best friend.

327
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,120
I won't leave until I hear back from her.

328
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,640
You only care about your best friend.

329
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,960
I wish you had the same concern for us.

330
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,360
What's there to be concerned about?

331
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,960
You think I don't notice

332
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,840
how uncomfortable you are
staying at my house?

333
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,639
What else can I do?

334
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,679
What does this mean?

335
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,880
I've been wanting to tell you this.

336
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,000
I don't want to sneak around anymore.

337
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,040
How long do you think
my sister can help keep this a secret?

338
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,080
So,

339
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,400
you want me to live with you in London?

340
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,360
But...

341
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,480
But my English is very bad.

342
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,120
And the only thing I know about London
is that London Bridge is falling down.

343
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,320
-It's dangerous--
-Shancai.

344
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,200
I want to make our relationship public.

345
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,320
I don't want to sneak around.

346
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm not happy about this.

347
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,880
And neither are you.

348
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,080
-But your mom--
-So before anything happens,

349
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,600
we must convince my mom.

350
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,560
How is that possible?

351
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
How is that impossible?

352
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Even though she's hard to convince,

353
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
she's still my mom.

354
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,640
I think I just need to tell her how I feel
and she'd understand me sooner or later.

355
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,400
Trust me. Just follow my lead.

356
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
That's all. Give me an answer tomorrow.
I'll go and get some sleep.

357
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,960
It's not that simple.

358
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,320
You don't know the things
your mom did to me.

359
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Can I trust you?

360
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,920
Si and Dong Shancai are dating.

361
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,440
What happened to the bodyguards I sent?

362
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,520
They've been paid off.

363
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,600
Paid off?

364
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,000
By Zhuang?

365
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,240
And Si rented the place next door
to Dong Shancai.

366
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,720
They're living closely together.

367
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Your White Jasmine Dew.

368
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,000
Thank you.

369
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Please come again.

370
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,640
Can we resolve this

371
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,080
if we go to London?

372
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,880
Xiaoyou?

373
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,840
Thank you for helping me
look for Ximen that day.

374
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,600
I wasn't even able to thank you then.

375
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,960
Thank you very much.

376
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,760
Your hair... I just had a haircut.

377
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,600
Do I look like a boy?
Does it look strange?

378
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,120
No. It's nice.

379
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,840
-Really?
-Yes.

380
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,840
But why did you cut your hair?

381
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,320
Did something happen?

382
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
No.

383
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,080
I just wanted a change.

384
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,000
And I've had long hair for so long.
I've grown tired of it.

385
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,080
Suddenly cutting her hair short,

386
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,160
suddenly wanting some changes,

387
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,560
those seem to be things
a broken-hearted person would do.

388
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
I'll go get changed then.

389
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,720
Hey, Xiaoyou.

390
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
Did you and Ximen...

391
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,280
Shancai.

392
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,240
I want to date again.

393
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
This time,

394
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,920
I really want to have
a happy relationship.

395
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,400
Sorry.

396
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
I made you so worried

397
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,680
this time around.

398
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,520
But I already did my best.

399
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,040
I feel at peace now.

400
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,160
You did your best?

401
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,600
What does that mean?

402
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,360
Did something happen with Ximen again?

403
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,800
Just give me a little more time.

404
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,520
I'd tell you everything when I'm ready.

405
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,280
You'd listen to me, right?

406
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,600
Yes.

407
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,440
The gentle Xiaoyou

408
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
recklessly did everything

409
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,040
for the person she loves.

410
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,280
I suddenly feel like
Xiaoyou has matured a lot.

411
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,280
She looks especially brilliant
and attractive.

412
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,520
And I

413
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
haven't listened to my heart

414
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,520
like she does for such a long time.

415
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,000
Even though she's hard to convince,

416
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,360
she's still my mom.

417
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,520
I think I just need to tell her how I feel

418
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,520
and she'd understand me sooner or later.

419
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,760
Trust me. Just follow my lead.

420
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,840
This time,

421
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,000
I should also be ready
to fight for my future.

422
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
I have to trust Daoming Si.

423
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,920
-Where are we eating?
-At a western restaurant.

424
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,800
We'll be there soon.

425
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,520
Let's go.

426
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,960
This is the new smart jewelry from Italy.

427
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,080
It's a hot trend right now.

428
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,800
The most important thing is it lets lovers
stay connected with one another.

429
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,400
What do you mean by that?

430
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,360
These bracelets are connected
with the mobile app.

431
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,040
Every time you think of each other
or need each other,

432
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,880
just lightly tap on it like this.

433
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,800
No matter how far you are from each other,

434
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,360
you'll receive the thought automatically
as it lights up and vibrates.

435
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,160
That's amazing.

436
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,960
So every time it lights up,
it means he's thinking of you.

437
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,960
Do you like it? Yes.
