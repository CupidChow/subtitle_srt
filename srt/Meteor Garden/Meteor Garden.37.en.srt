TALENT'S TEA SHOP

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
Hi. Your White Jasmine Dew
and Peach Red Royale.

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
-Please come again.
-Thank you.

6
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,280
Xiaoyou.

7
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,240
Where did you and Ximen go the other day?

8
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
Did anything happen?

9
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,520
Nothing happened.

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
Xiaoyou, listen to me.

11
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,400
You and Ximen can be good friends.

12
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,600
But you can't date him. You'll get hurt, you know?

13
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Why do you always say that about him?

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,200
Because I've seen it with my own eyes.

15
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,760
He dates girls one after another.

16
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,720
You know that too, right?

17
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Ximen won't be serious with you...

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,480
No.

19
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
He won't be serious with anyone.

20
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,400
How do you know?

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you understand him?

22
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,080
You don't. So how can you conclude that?

23
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
How about you? Do you understand him?

24
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
Does he want you to understand him?

25
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,880
That's none of your business.

26
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,720
Asking about other people's privacy
is very impolite.

27
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
You're right.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,240
He doesn't.

29
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm sorry, Xiaoyou.

30
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,840
I was too harsh.

31
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
I just don't want you to get hurt.

32
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Shancai.

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,120
What is it?

34
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,480
One day, if Ximen treats me
like a stranger, don't be surprised.

35
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,920
You're acting really strange.

36
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,720
I've already decided.

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,840
Decided what?

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
Cheers. You're beautiful.

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,200
-You're so sweet.
-Okay.

40
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
How long have you been in Shanghai?

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,440
I just arrived here.

42
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
Really?

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,040
You're the first person I know here.

44
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,200
-Let's toast to our encounter.
-It's too noisy here.

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Let's go somewhere else.

46
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
-Sure.
-It's Xiaoyou.

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Why is she all alone there?

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,880
Did something happen to her?

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
Forget about her.

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
What do you want to drink?

51
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm fine. All right.

52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,480
I think you like fruity cocktails.

53
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
The sweet ones.

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,360
Hey.

55
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
It's okay. I'll order if I want something.

56
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,120
Aren't you here all alone
so that someone else can order for you?

57
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
No, that's not why I'm here.

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,640
I noticed you immediately
when you came in.

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,960
You sat here and didn't order anything.

60
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,040
Weren't you hoping someone
would come over and chat with you?

61
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,720
-Listen to me.
-All right. Buy me a drink.

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't know the rules
since it's my first time here.

63
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
You're such a cute girl.

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,480
No problem. Let's drink.

65
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
It's my treat. Order whatever you want.

66
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,400
Okay. Let's drink.

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,560
I can tell that you're not a girl
who frequents bars.

68
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,320
It's your first time in a bar

69
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
and we met.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
I'm so lucky.

71
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,320
Someone bought me a drink
when it's my first time here.

72
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,600
I'm quite lucky too.

73
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,560
How alcohol tolerant are you?

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
I haven't really drunk that much before.

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,080
Then you will know
how much you can drink today.

76
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Ximen.

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Where are we going later?

78
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Karaoke? A restaurant? Or to your place?

79
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,080
-To your place, of course.
-Really?

80
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
-Xiaoyou is drinking too much.
-One more glass.

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Can she handle it?

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,880
All that guy ordered for her
are strong drinks.

83
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,160
If this continues,
Xiaoyou will get drunk soon.

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,600
Aren't you going to check on her?

85
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,760
You're sitting at the bar too.

86
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm buying this time. What are you having?

87
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,000
You're so cute.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,440
Guys are supposed to buy drinks for girls.

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,440
Not the other way around.

90
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,160
Shouldn't I pay you back
for your generosity?

91
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,600
Let's make a deal first.
If you buy me a drink

92
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,600
and I get drunk,
you have to take responsibility.

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,560
One drink should be fine.

94
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,400
I don't want to owe you anything.

95
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,320
We'll have the same again.

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,400
-Are you drunk?
-I'm not.

97
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,520
-My face is just a bit hot.
-Let me see.

98
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,320
You had too much to drink.

99
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Do you want to get some air outside?

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
-What do you think?
-There's no need.

101
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,080
I want to go home.

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
The drink just arrived. Maybe after this drink?

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,560
I bought that drink for you.

104
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,880
No.

105
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,440
You said you're going home.
So you have to drink this.

106
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,000
That's my wish.

107
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,880
If you don't want to drink it
and want to go home,

108
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll take you home.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
All right.

110
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,440
-I'll leave after I drink this.
-Sure.

111
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,200
I'll take you home after this.

112
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
I'll drink this for her.

113
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,040
-Who are you?
-Done.

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
You can go now.

115
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,840
Bye then.

116
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
You're drunk, right?

117
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,200
You drank so much, of course you are.

118
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,120
I thought I'd be drunk.

119
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
But I can actually drink a lot.

120
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,360
-Want to buy me another drink?
-Why are you doing this?

121
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
Why did you come to such a place?

122
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
If you can come here, I can too.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,360
If you can drink, I can too.

124
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
And I learned how to order drinks today.

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,760
Never mind. I'll buy you a drink.

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,040
-We'll have the same--
-Come on.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,880
I've already decided.

128
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
I want to be with you.

129
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,120
Do you know that you're giving me
a hard time?

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
And you're making me mad.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,880
I know.

132
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,440
Stop being so self-centered.

133
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,640
Don't act like you want to give up
everything for me.

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
That doesn't work on me.

135
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,440
And do you think other girls around me
never acted like you do?

136
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,080
But right now,
I'm the one in front of you.

137
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
You're...

138
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,640
really one of a kind.

139
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

140
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,960
I think I'm a weirdo too.

141
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
So?

142
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,480
What do you want me to do?

143
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,440
Last time, you said
that there's always regret in love.

144
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,240
So did you also have regrets in love?

145
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Tell me.

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
Let me know.

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,600
I promise I'll stay away from you.
I won't bother you anymore.

148
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,000
All right. I'll tell you.

149
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,680
But after this, leave me alone.

150
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
Okay.

151
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,560
What do you want to know?

152
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,480
Everything.

153
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
I knew a girl named Xiaogeng before.

154
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,600
We grew up together.

155
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
She used to live next door

156
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,200
and always came to play at my house.

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,040
Seven.

158
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,320
Nine.

159
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,480
J.

160
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,640
I win.

161
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,200
Don't play poker again.

162
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,600
But I'm better at playing cards
than studying.

163
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,760
I can help you.

164
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,880
I'll help you get good grades.

165
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,880
Am I that easily convinced?

166
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm used to having Xiaogeng by my side.

167
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,320
Being together
was as natural as breathing.

168
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,920
You're not studying at all.

169
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,240
But on the other hand,
she made me breathless.

170
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,720
Even though my family seems
to be doing well,

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,560
it has been long broken.

172
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,560
Can't you just pretend?

173
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
You haven't been coming home.

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
Have you ever considered my position?

175
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,560
Can we stop fooling other people
as well as ourselves?

176
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,560
Let's stop pretending.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Whether we get divorced or not,

178
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,640
I'll take care of you.

179
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
-But we can't go back to the way we were.
-You...

180
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
My parents' marriage was a lie.

181
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,920
They were leading false lives.

182
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,920
And they wanted me to live the same way.

183
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,560
But it was really hard.

184
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,800
Tell me.

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,800
Can people's feelings

186
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,960
remain unchanged their whole lives?

187
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,520
I get it now.

188
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,320
You were influenced
by your parents' relationship.

189
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,960
You don't trust love.

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,760
I always saw and heard my mom crying.

191
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
I've learned one thing.

192
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Love hurts people too much.

193
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,720
Love is like a sharp blade.

194
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,400
The more you hold on to it,
the deeper and more painful your wound is.

195
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,440
I was fortunate
to have Xiaogeng by my side.

196
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,000
She was a switch given by the heavens

197
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,200
that could turn off
all the lies in this world.

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,120
At that time,

199
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,160
I felt relaxed whenever I saw Xiaogeng.

200
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
Chocolate.

201
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,360
Cake.

202
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,840
Ice cream.

203
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,960
They're so delicious.

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
Xiaogeng was different from F3.

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,240
Her existence made me feel at peace.

206
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,560
I hoped our relationship
would never change.

207
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,920
I hoped we would always stay the same
forever and ever.

208
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,760
Men don't seem
to like dolls and stuffed toys.

209
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,640
It depends. To me,

210
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,520
you're the best stuffed toy.

211
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
Me? Do I look like one?

212
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Then I'll become a doll.

213
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,560
But Xiaogeng was not a doll.

214
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
She didn't just want to stay in one place.

215
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,800
She moved closer to me.

216
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,520
I knew she gathered up
her courage to do it.

217
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,400
Look at me.

218
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,680
Do I look like a girl now?

219
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,880
Take me out.

220
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
Okay?

221
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,760
What has gotten into you today?

222
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
Why are you wearing that?

223
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,720
It looks so strange.

224
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,200
Did you also put on makeup?

225
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,960
Don't change so quickly.

226
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,200
Go scare other people.
Don't come and scare me.

227
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,680
I know, right?

228
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,600
I think this doesn't suit me either.

229
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm too boyish.

230
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,880
By the way, I need to go and do something.

231
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,120
I'll get going now.

232
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,160
I'll come again tomorrow.

233
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,880
I hurt her really bad
so that she wouldn't come near me.

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
Xiaogeng.

235
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,880
Please stay where you are.

236
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
It's the best for you and me.

237
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
It's been a while since I tasted
the tea you made.

238
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,640
It's so good.

239
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
You're exaggerating.

240
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
It really is.

241
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
You've been busy lately.

242
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,400
I don't see you when I come here.

243
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,280
What's the matter?
Why were you looking for me?

244
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,119
It's nothing.

245
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,200
Xiaogeng, why don't you find a boyfriend?

246
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,240
What if I have a boyfriend
and you ask me to come for tea?

247
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,920
I won't be able to come then.

248
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,440
You think too much.

249
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm always very busy.

250
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
I ignored how hurt she felt.

251
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,080
And purposely stayed away.

252
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
I thought I was doing the right thing.

253
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,600
But Xiaogeng never came for tea again.

254
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,080
All right. I'm done talking.

255
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,840
Based on our deal,

256
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,160
don't come to me again.

257
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,800
Your White Jasmine Dew.

258
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
Please come again.

259
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,480
Hi, ma'am.

260
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
-Is Xiaoyou not coming today?
-No.

261
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,120
She called and said
she won't be coming for a while.

262
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Why?

263
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,320
She didn't tell me.

264
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
She sounded quite down.

265
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
So I didn't ask.

266
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,200
So you have to work extra hard.

267
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,760
-I'm sorry about that.
-It's fine.

268
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,080
Did you bring your friend home today?

269
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,520
What do you care?

270
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
It doesn't matter if you did.

271
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
We didn't see anything anyway.

272
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,360
We wouldn't say anything if we did.

273
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,080
ZHUANG

274
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
I went back to London.

275
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,160
Take care of yourself.

276
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,680
And take good care of Shancai.

277
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,880
By the way, are you satisfied
with my arrangement?

278
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Arrangement?

279
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,840
That night,

280
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,600
Ximen said his story
with Xiaogeng's was over.

281
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,920
But I don't think so.

282
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
He's still not over it.

283
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,360
I feel so lost going around
all these buildings.

284
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
But I'm determined to do so.

285
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,080
Because I really want to find the answer.

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
Xiaoyou.

287
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,880
Mom.

288
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Come here. I want to talk to you.

289
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,840
Xiaoyou, where do you always go at night?

290
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
You leave in the middle of the night
and return early morning.

291
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,600
Right?

292
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,240
Are you doing something
that you can't tell me?

293
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,640
No. I'm not.

294
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,560
What is this?

295
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,280
What exactly are you looking for?

296
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,400
Names of different buildings
are listed there.

297
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,840
And you marked the places
you've been and haven't been to.

298
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,600
What are you looking for?

299
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,720
I'm not doing anything
you should worry about.

300
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
This might be
a very important time for me.

301
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,000
Mom, I hope you understand.

302
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,160
Hey.

303
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,200
What is it? You scared me, you jerk.

304
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,720
Where are your bodyguards?

305
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,240
My sister took care of them.

306
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Listen carefully.

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,960
You didn't see anything.
And you won't say anything.

308
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,120
Understand?

309
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Wait.

310
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,840
As Daoming family's bodyguards,
that won't work.

311
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,520
Even if you're a bodyguard,

312
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,880
you have to look good
and be more confident.

313
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Ms. Zhuang is so strange.

314
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,240
My sister is really unusual.

315
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,760
Why would she have such
an outstanding brother otherwise?

316
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,720
Ms. Zhuang is really outstanding.

317
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,600
But you...

318
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,040
What?

319
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Say it clearly, stupid girl.

320
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,520
You're the stupid one, the stupidest.

321
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,080
Me? You're the stupidest of them all.

322
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
If you didn't pull down your teammates,

323
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,440
I'd have already conquered
Fantasy Westward Journey.

324
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,360
Fantasy? Fantasy what?

325
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Fantasy Westward Journey?

326
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Yes.

327
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,880
-You can play it, why can't I?
-I...

328
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
I didn't say you can't play it.

329
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,000
But you never played with me.

330
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,160
How would you know
if I pulled down my teammates?

331
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,080
I play with you all the time.

332
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,600
I know clearly how you play.

333
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,000
What?

334
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
All right.

335
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,160
Actually, I'm "I Call the Shots."

336
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,720
You're "I Call the Shots"?

337
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,440
How's that possible?
He's the X9 League champion.

338
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,040
How can you play so well?

339
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,400
You don't believe me?

340
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,200
What do you think? I'm so cool, right?

341
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,200
I've wanted to show you for a long time.
I just haven't had the chance.

342
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,920
You're really "I Call the Shots."

343
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,840
You're amazing.

344
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,400
But don't use codenames to play games
without me knowing again.

345
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,320
I'll do whatever I want. Why do you care?

346
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,200
Shancai.

347
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,240
Is that the medal
in Fantasy Westward Journey?

348
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,880
Yes.

349
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,200
You're amazing.
You got the champion medal.

350
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
I like it so much.

351
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,960
Can you give it to me?

352
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,440
I really treasure this. You wish.

353
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,880
How stingy of you.

354
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,280
It's been days.

355
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,880
I've been going to different buildings
in the city after my class.

356
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

357
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,080
But like Xiaogeng,
I want to do this for Ximen.

358
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,760
So I couldn't stop.

359
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,000
ENTER STREET AFTER 29 METERS

360
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,680
BEEN THERE

361
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,760
Where's Si?

362
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
He should be here soon.

363
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,080
Why do you look like
you're only half-awake?

364
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,360
It's too early.

365
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,080
How is it too early?
It's already noon, okay?

366
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,120
How's your recital practice going?

367
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,280
It's all right.

368
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
How about you?

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,880
I'm quite interested
in your exhibit this time.

370
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,640
I knew you'd like it. We'll be done with the preparations soon.

371
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
You have to be there on the opening day.

372
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,240
Okay.

373
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,400
It's so hard to even go on a date now.
I'm so envious of the college students.

374
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,720
They can have a daily romance.

375
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,120
Ximen.

376
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
How did it go with Xiaoyou that night?

377
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,840
You didn't come back to the bar.
You also didn't answer my calls.

378
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
-Xiaoyou has fallen, right?
-Fallen?

379
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,240
What do you mean?

380
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,440
Nothing. We're talking about someone else.

381
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Xiaoyou?

382
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,920
Oh. Shancai's best friend.

383
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,200
Lei, aren't you usually bad with names?

384
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,760
Hey, didn't you say you will never
touch Xiaoyou?

385
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,960
What's going on?
I just arrived and he left.

386
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,480
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

387
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,120
-Two Peach Red Royales.
-Thank you.

388
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,360
Please come again.

389
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,240
Xiaoyou.

390
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,040
Can you tell me what's going on
between you and Ximen?

391
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
Shancai, stop asking me.

392
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,680
This is between me and Ximen.

393
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,800
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

394
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,120
But I'm really worried about you.

395
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,920
I met Ximen today.
He was also acting quite strange.

396
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
He was?

397
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,400
Yes.

398
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,480
Both of you are not like yourselves.

399
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,880
It's all because of me.

400
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,640
I'll take care of it.

401
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

402
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,680
It'll be fine, Shancai.

403
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
Just cheer for me.

404
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
I hope you can cheer for me.

405
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,160
That's what you said before.

406
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,960
I just want to hear that.

407
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,480
All right.

408
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
You can do it.

409
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,840
By the way, I told our boss
I'd leave earlier.

410
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll leave the rest to you then.
I'll get going now. Bye.

411
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,920
Hey. Wait.

412
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,040
Why? Did something happen again?

413
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,960
Xiaoyou. Hey.

414
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,600
Daoming Si.

415
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm being serious. Bring me to Ximen.

416
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,920
Why?

417
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,760
I don't care. Bring me to Ximen
or we're breaking up.

418
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,600
Have you had dinner?

419
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,960
Yes. Do you believe that?

420
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,280
I don't think so.

421
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,680
Si, why are you here?

422
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,000
Something's up.

423
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,200
Miss, don't be fooled by this wolf
in sheep's clothing.

424
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
Shancai.

425
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,520
Don't you have anything better to do?

426
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,560
Do you know that Xiaoyou's so down
and she's crying every day?

427
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Isn't that because of you? It can't be because of someone else.

428
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,080
Tell me. What exactly happened
between you two?

429
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,280
Nothing happened.

430
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,400
But she has to grow up.

431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,200
No. Let's talk about it outside.

432
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,960
Hey.

433
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,920
Xiaoyou is serious about you.
Why are you so irresponsible?

434
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,840
Do you have to be so mad?

435
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,639
What does Xiaoyou's business
have to do with you?

436
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,880
She's my friend.

437
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,040
How can I not be concerned?

438
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
And you.

439
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,520
You're such a lousy friend.

440
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,280
Can't you just date seriously?

441
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,280
Can't you just treasure nice girls?

442
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,960
That's right.

443
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,320
-Learn from me.
-Haven't you had enough? If you don't like Xiaoyou,
why did you show any interest?

444
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,520
Yes. I did show some interest.

445
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,760
I regret it now.

446
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I'm not a good man.
I'll never be with her.

447
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,520
Satisfied?

448
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,840
Hey, Ximen.

449
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,920
Why did you do that?
Why did you go to Ximen?

450
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,720
I told you I'd take care of it.

451
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,720
Take care of what?

452
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,600
What can you take care of?

453
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,880
I...

454
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,680
You haven't been to work or home.
What are you trying to do?

455
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,360
Ximen said he doesn't like you.

456
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,360
I know. You don't have to remind me.

457
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
Is this all worth it

458
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,680
just for Ximen? Shancai.

459
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Don't mind me.

460
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,760
Just let me do what I want.

461
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,040
He treated you that way.

462
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,840
You still refuse to give up?

463
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,080
I want to know
what the girl Ximen liked did for him

464
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,720
or else I won't feel at ease.

465
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,320
Does it matter if you find out?

466
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,480
Yes. It matters to me now.

467
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,560
Xiaogeng is the only one who knows you

468
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,480
before you led a false life

469
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,360
or maybe even after that.

470
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,960
You left your sincerity
in the Way of the Tea.

471
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,960
She knew that.

472
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,560
Have you ever heard of what they call
"Once in a Lifetime" in the tea ceremony?

473
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,800
The first time I heard of it

474
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,440
was when my teacher mentioned it.

475
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,720
Do you know what "Once in a Lifetime"
means in the Way of the Tea?

476
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,480
It means

477
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,400
a certain encounter
will only happen once in this life.

478
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,840
Treasure every encounter
as if it's the last one.

479
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,920
Do everything you can.

480
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,480
Don't have any regrets.

481
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,600
No matter what you do
or who you encounter,

482
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,560
that's the attitude

483
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,760
you should have in life.

484
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,520
The Way of the Tea's "Once in a Lifetime"

485
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,960
is a pursuit of sincerity.

486
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,480
And...

487
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,640
I could never do that.

488
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,680
What happened between you two?

489
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,160
QZONE MESSAGE FROM XIAOGENG

490
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
Ximen. This is Xiaogeng.

491
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,280
I have something to show you.

492
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,120
I'll send you the address.

493
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,480
See you at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

494
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Ximen said

495
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,080
she never went to his house to have tea,
do homework, and play cards again.

496
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,240
The last time she contacted him
was for a date.

497
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
She set it at a specific location

498
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,440
at a specific time,

499
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,760
which was at 5 a.m.

500
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,520
I keep telling myself it would be fine.

501
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,080
As long as we never begin anything,
there'd be no ending as well.

502
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,920
As long as I don't go there,

503
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,040
Xiaogeng and I can surely
go back to the way we were.

504
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,800
Because I don't want to lose her.

505
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,160
Don't you want to know
what Xiaogeng wanted to show you?

506
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
That day,

507
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,400
Ximen simply deleted
the address Xiaogeng sent.

508
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
He didn't want to look at it.

509
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,120
By not knowing where it was,

510
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,240
he could repress his feelings
and not go there.

511
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,240
Because he didn't have
the courage to find out

512
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
what Xiaogeng wants to confess to him. Did you listen to
the QZone voice message I sent?

513
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,960
I did.

514
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,120
But I went out with my friends
all night yesterday.

515
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,760
I see. Xiaogeng.

516
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,000
I mean, who meets at 5 a.m.?

517
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,480
It's too early.

518
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,520
I had too much fun last night.
I'm going to sleep now.

519
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
Ximen.

520
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,040
It'll be all right.

521
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,080
I told myself

522
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,080
that tomorrow, Xiaogeng
would be back like nothing happened.

523
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,440
She'd surely come to me with a smile then.

524
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,960
We'd surely be back to the way we were.

525
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,160
Because...

526
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,600
I don't want to lose her.

527
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,640
Goodbye.
