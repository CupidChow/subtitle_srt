A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 42

3
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,560
Lei, are you back from London?

4
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Let's meet up.

5
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,120
Is this...

6
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,160
a dream? Daoming Si?

7
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,760
Daoming Si? Daoming Si!

8
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,400
Daoming Si! Wake up!

9
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Daoming Si! Hey!

10
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Are you really dead?

11
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,800
Hey!

12
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,040
Hey!

13
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,880
Wake up!

14
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,560
You almost beat me to death.

15
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,360
You're awake.

16
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,480
Where are we?

17
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't know.

18
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,840
There's nobody around.

19
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,240
My phone is gone.

20
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
What about yours?

21
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
Mine is gone too.

22
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,280
What happened?

23
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Are you crazy?

24
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,440
You know how important he is
to Daoming Group right now.

25
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,560
How could you let him out?
Where did he go?

26
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
If he doesn't come back,

27
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
our family will be doomed.
Don't you know that?

28
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,320
You're the one who destroyed
the Daoming family.

29
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,360
What are you talking about?

30
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,640
It was the same with Zhuang.

31
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,280
Now it's Si.

32
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
They're your children,

33
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,560
-not your pawns!
-Shut up!

34
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,680
Go find him right now!

35
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,080
Si just went out to have some noodles.

36
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,320
He'll be back.

37
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,920
Is he having noodles all night long?

38
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,880
We could make noodles for him at home!

39
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,960
When he's at home,

40
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,200
he doesn't have any appetite.

41
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,240
Mrs. Daoming.

42
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,920
For the former president of our group...

43
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
For his father, for you,

44
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,040
Si has begun to face reality.

45
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,600
Give him some time.

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,400
I don't care.

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,320
Go find him.

48
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm taking him to a party tonight.

49
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,120
Mr. He's daughter will be there.

50
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,520
Mrs. Daoming, Mr. He is on the phone.

51
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Hello? Mr. He?

52
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,080
So, about tonight--

53
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
What did you say?

54
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,920
-How did we get kidnapped?
-How would I know?

55
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,640
How could you not know?

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,760
I was attacked with a taser.

57
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,960
I couldn't even see his face.
How would I know anything?

58
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,120
I wasn't attacked. Why did I faint too?

59
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
Was it...

60
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
your mom?

61
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,200
The person who kidnapped us
doesn't work for our family.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
How can you be sure?

63
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,600
If my bodyguard attacked me with a taser,

64
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
I would have killed him first.

65
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Are you scared?

66
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,320
Aren't you worried?

67
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
We're stuck on an island

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,120
with no water,

69
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
no food,

70
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,440
and no cell phones.

71
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,200
Hey. Where are you going?

72
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,680
If you want to survive, help me out.

73
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,680
Hey.

74
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,440
I found a bag.

75
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,600
A fishing rod.

76
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
A lighter.

77
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,160
And a bottle of water.

78
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,560
Si...

79
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,920
Hello, this is Xitian.

80
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,280
Xitian.

81
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
Has Mr. He said anything?

82
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,640
Does he know who did it?

83
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
No.

84
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
Xiaozi's bodyguard was unconscious.
He didn't see anything.

85
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
What about Zhuang? Where is she?

86
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
Miss Zhuang is fine.

87
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,840
She had a fight with her husband
and went to the Alps alone.

88
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,440
How much money is your son worth?

89
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,160
Have some water.

90
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
Thank you.

91
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
We've been missing for over 24 hours now.

92
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,920
People are probably worried about us.

93
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
But can they find us here?

94
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Don't forget,

95
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,560
I'm missing too.

96
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,000
My mom can find anything in this world.

97
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,920
As long as we survive,

98
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm sure they will find us.

99
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
I suddenly think your mom is so reliable.

100
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,640
Is it okay for me to think that?

101
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
Being on this island
where time is irrelevant,

102
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
nothing is important anymore.

103
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
We should thank the person
who kidnapped us.

104
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,520
If it wasn't for him,

105
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,080
we would've been separated by now.

106
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,720
The sunset is so pretty.

107
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,200
This is our first time watching
the sunset together, right?

108
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,400
Yes.

109
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll go gather some firewood.

110
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
Let's go together.
I need some grass to make a bed.

111
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,040
It's getting dark.

112
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,720
If you get lost, I'll have to go find you.

113
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
Come on.

114
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,960
I made a bed with wood and grass.

115
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
You should go to sleep.

116
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,000
A sea view

117
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,560
and a personal suite.

118
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
This is the best gift I've ever received.

119
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,320
Are you not sleeping?

120
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
There might be wild animals at night.

121
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,080
I need to tend to the fire.
You should sleep.

122
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,520
Wild animals?

123
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
That's very unlikely.

124
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
I'll go check it out.

125
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
Stay here and don't move.

126
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,119
Daoming Si.

127
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,680
Daoming Si. Daoming Si.

128
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
Daoming Si.

129
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,360
Who is it?

130
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,480
Daoming Si.

131
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,520
Is that you?

132
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480
That was so scary.

133
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
Why didn't you wait by the fire?

134
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,360
I heard some noises over here.

135
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,880
I was so scared.

136
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,120
Don't be scared. I'm here.

137
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
Daoming Si.

138
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
Can you never leave me again?

139
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
I'll never leave you again.

140
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
Go to sleep. I'll watch the fire.

141
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
No.

142
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,040
What if someone attacks us at midnight?

143
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,840
You won't be able to fight them off.

144
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,640
I feel scared whenever I think

145
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,240
of those bad guys watching us in the dark.

146
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,960
Go lie down if you can't sleep.

147
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,520
We'll go explore the forest tomorrow.

148
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,080
And you said you weren't tired.

149
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
This way, please.

150
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,800
The He family group is doing the same.

151
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
We'll track their location
through their phones.

152
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
You said the cameras
didn't get the kidnapper's face?

153
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,680
How is that possible? Tell me!

154
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,920
It was a blind spot.

155
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,480
It's obvious that
it was a planned kidnapping.

156
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
-What should I do?
-About that--

157
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,080
Has the kidnapper contacted you?

158
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,120
No, not at all.

159
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
If you can contact the kidnapper,

160
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
please tell him,

161
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll give him any amount he wants.

162
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,160
About that...

163
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,480
What?

164
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,800
What are you saying?

165
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,840
If anything happens to my son,

166
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,520
what am I going to do?

167
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,320
All right.

168
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
Daoming Si!

169
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,040
Daoming Si, where are you? Daoming Si!

170
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
Shancai, I got some squid!

171
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,080
You didn't sleep all night?

172
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,080
It's not a big deal.

173
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,960
It smells great.

174
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,240
If only we had some
Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce.

175
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,480
You don't know how well
the King of Squid is doing.

176
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,920
Of course I know.

177
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,360
You know?

178
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,160
I saw your video.

179
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,960
Also, who designed that hat?

180
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
It's so ugly!

181
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,000
That's what a squid looks like.

182
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
I guess at that time,

183
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,840
Lei was the one by your side.

184
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
All I do...

185
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,840
is hurt you.

186
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,920
Maybe...

187
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,880
Maybe Lei can make you happier than I can.

188
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Daoming Si.

189
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,840
What are you talking about?

190
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,440
You said you like me.

191
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
And now you're pushing me away
to someone else?

192
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,760
Do you think I'll be happier
with someone else?

193
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,280
You're an idiot.

194
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,400
I understand.

195
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,040
No matter what happens,

196
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I won't let go of you.

197
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,160
Actually,

198
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,720
when you came to see me in London,

199
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,600
I was so happy. I really regret

200
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,640
breaking up with you so viciously.

201
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,680
I regret it so much.

202
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,160
The last time we spoke,
Shancai was going to the airport.

203
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,480
But if you think about it,

204
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
she should already be there.

205
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,320
If Shancai's missing, what about Lei?

206
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Did he find her?

207
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,960
Now I can't even get in touch
with Ximen and Meizuo.

208
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
I wonder if something happened.

209
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,560
-What if the plane she was on--
-Hey!

210
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,680
Why would you say that?

211
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,240
That would be
on the international news, okay?

212
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Shancai.

213
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,160
Are you okay?

214
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
I'm fine.

215
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Don't move.

216
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,240
Let me see.

217
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,280
Don't move.

218
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
What are you doing?

219
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,080
That's so ugly.

220
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,280
It's better than your ugly hat.

221
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,200
Let's go.

222
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,720
I feel their presence nearby.

223
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,160
If we run into them, I'll beat them up.

224
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
Have you heard? Si is missing.

225
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
The ICPO is on the case.

226
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,080
I hope they'll be okay.

227
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,520
You mean--

228
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
Daoming Si.

229
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,520
It's getting dark.

230
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,960
There's nobody here.

231
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
What should we do?

232
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
Will we die here?

233
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,080
No.

234
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
I won't let that happen.

235
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,840
Trust me.

236
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,720
Where's the sunshine, beach and hot girls?

237
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,920
Hey.

238
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,480
Did you hear

239
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,440
someone talking over there?

240
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,720
I think so.

241
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
How would I know
the weather would be like this?

242
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
It's so windy. I'm freezing.

243
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,160
Slow down.

244
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,520
Be careful.

245
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
I shouldn't have listened to you.

246
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,520
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

247
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm going to beat you up!

248
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,840
Get over here! -I'll kill you!
-Hey!

249
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,600
Shancai!

250
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,480
-Get over here!
-Calm down, man!

251
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Stop! Stop running!

252
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,800
Stop it!

253
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,520
I'll kill you!

254
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,960
-I got you!
-Why did you do this to us?

255
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Stop!

256
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,960
-I'll kill you!
-It wasn't me!

257
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,720
-Is this a prank?
-Stop!

258
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,600
-Go to hell!
-It wasn't me!

259
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,240
-I'm dying here.
-You think you're so smart.

260
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
-It wasn't me.
-Pranking me?

261
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,200
Shancai, I prepared some drinks for you.

262
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Do you want some?

263
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,760
Xiaozi, what's going on?

264
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,960
Can't you tell?

265
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,000
This is my brilliant plan.

266
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,000
Look at him.
He got chased and then held captive.

267
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,360
Poor thing.

268
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,640
He just wants to be
in a relationship with you.

269
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,440
So, I decided to bring you to this island.

270
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,680
Bring us? That was kidnapping.

271
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Your mom did things to Shancai's friends.

272
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm just giving her
a taste of her own medicine.

273
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,160
So,

274
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,520
your bodyguard used a taser on me?

275
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,640
That was me.

276
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,400
How else could I beat you?

277
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
What a jerk! Stop it!

278
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,760
That scared me.

279
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,600
Don't hit her.

280
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,800
I understand why Monkey did this,

281
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,760
but the three of you got involved too?

282
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,920
Hey, don't take this prank too seriously.

283
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
How about you forgive us?

284
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,960
Despite the weather,
maybe you should do it today.

285
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
Or you'll keep worrying about it.

286
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,640
Do what?

287
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,240
Get married.

288
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,200
Destination weddings are always romantic.

289
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
The rain is falling. How special.

290
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,200
Si and Shancai would be
the most terribly-dressed couple.

291
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,200
We would be the most terribly-dressed
bridesmaid and groomsmen too.

292
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,920
I'm sure Si and Shancai
can go through anything together.

293
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,440
I've decided.

294
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,280
I've decided that

295
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,680
no matter what happens,

296
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,680
I have to be with Dong Shancai!

297
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,000
You like Shancai, Shancai likes you.

298
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,640
We knew that a long time ago.

299
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,680
Si, what about your family business?

300
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,280
I won't give up on Shancai
or Daoming Group.

301
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm going back to London.
I'll take care of everything.

302
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm Daoming Si!

303
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,320
Because I'm Daoming Si,

304
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,400
I'll never give up on Shancai!

305
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Si, I support you!

306
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,280
I support you, brother.

307
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Me too!

308
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,520
Me too!

309
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
We'll help you!

310
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,520
You're crazy!

311
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,840
Yes, we're the cutest!

312
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,080
-Crazy people!
-Crazy!

313
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,160
Crazy!

314
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,320
-You're crazy!
-You're crazy!

315
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,600
-Crazy people!
-Stop!

316
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,200
Come here! Si.

317
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,720
-Get over here!
-Come here.

318
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,960
You too, Xiaozi! Mrs. Daoming, food is ready.

319
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,320
-Take it away. I don't want it.
-But--

320
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,920
Why is it so hard to catch a kidnapper?

321
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,639
Why can't the server locate them? Why?

322
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,639
Hello, this is Daoming Feng.

323
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,880
Are there any updates?

324
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,520
Michael?

325
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Which Michael?

326
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
How is that possible?

327
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
The kidnapper is
Xiaozi's bodyguard, Michael?

328
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,239
Michael?

329
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,080
Now on the international news,

330
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,920
the successor of Daoming Group, Daoming Si

331
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,880
and He Yuanzi from the He Business Group,
have been missing for three days.

332
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,840
The groups have officially denied this,

333
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,400
but we have received confirmation

334
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,200
that the kidnappers have been identified.

335
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Ms. Xiaozi.

336
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,800
Are you telling me
that it was just a prank?

337
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,960
It's on the international news now.

338
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,680
What am I supposed to do?
You really messed up.

339
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,120
What will happen when we go back?

340
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,800
Don't worry. I'll be there with you.

341
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,320
Thank you for not giving up on me.

342
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,040
How could I leave you?

343
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,080
Shancai.

344
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
I love you.

345
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,200
How many times
have we slept together like this?

346
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,000
When can we take the next step?

347
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,800
Come out.

348
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
What did you say?

349
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,240
It wasn't a kidnapping?

350
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,400
They're all safe?

351
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,840
Keep talking.

352
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,520
Mr. He's daughter, Xiaozi,
planned a prank?

353
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,200
I understand.

354
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,600
What a terrible prank.

355
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,680
Unforgivable.

356
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,160
Xitian, notify
the public relations officer.

357
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,240
This has to do with the public image
of the successor of Daoming Group.

358
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,640
Block all negative news
in the media immediately.

359
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,680
How is Si?

361
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,800
Si?

362
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
He's doing fine.

363
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,480
He's having
a carefree vacation on the island. He's under the protection of the ICPO.

364
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,160
He's heading to Shanghai right now.

365
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,160
How could she plan
such a huge prank like that?

366
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,120
Unbelievable.

367
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,240
But the good thing is that they're safe.

368
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,680
That's what's important.

369
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,880
Xitian, buy the tickets. -We're flying to Shanghai tomorrow.
-Yes, ma'am.

370
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,040
They're coming.

371
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,960
Daoming Si.

372
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,880
Daoming Si!

373
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
-Daoming Si.
-Don't push.

374
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,080
Daoming Si!

375
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,640
-Move.
-Daoming Si!

376
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,560
-Sir.
-Sir.

377
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,560
-Where did you go?
-Tell us.

378
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,400
Sir, please answer some questions.

379
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,600
-Daoming Si!
-Sir.

380
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,800
-Can you explain where you've been?
-Please answer us.

381
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
We have so many questions.

382
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,880
-Please answer us.
-Sir.

383
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,160
Please explain everything.

384
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
-Daoming Si.
-Sir.

385
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,520
What happened? Who are all these people?

386
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,960
The only son of
Daoming Group went missing,

387
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,800
it's probably all over the news.

388
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
That's great.

389
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,040
Now we're probably seen as kidnappers.

390
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,200
The first thing I have to do
is to find Xiaozi.

391
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,880
The media is here for Si.

392
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,400
Let's split up.

393
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll stay with Si.

394
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,520
You guys take Shancai
and go the other way.

395
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,880
Why do I have to part with Shancai?

396
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
You want your mom to see you
hold Shancai's hand

397
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,800
after seeing the news?

398
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
Yes. I want her to see it.

399
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,520
I want the whole world to see.

400
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,800
I don't know if you're brave or stupid.

401
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,200
I'm both of them.

402
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,880
All right.

403
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,160
I'll walk with you.

404
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,880
Ximen, Meizuo,

405
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,280
you guys help distract the media.

406
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,600
-Say something.
-Where did you go?

407
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,040
-Can you explain?
-Please answer.

408
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,280
Mr. Daoming,

409
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,080
-explain where you've been.
-Tell us.

410
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,520
-We need to ask you something.
-Yes.

411
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,840
-Mr. Daoming.
-Excuse us.

412
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,880
-Please move.
-Talk to us.

413
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,160
-Sir!
-We just want to interview you.

414
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,400
-Mr. Daoming!
-Excuse us.

415
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,000
-Excuse me.
-Talk to us.

416
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,240
Mr. Daoming,
you were kidnapped for 72 hours.

417
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,880
What happened during that time?

418
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,600
Were they international criminals?
Did you see them?

419
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,720
Why is F4 here?

420
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,360
-Please answer us.
-Talk to us.

421
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,240
-Where were you?
-Mr. Daoming!

422
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,880
-Is this your girlfriend?
-Mr. Daoming!

423
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,880
Talk to us.

424
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,320
-Answer us.
-What's your name?

425
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,480
-Get out of the way!
-Talk to us.

426
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Stop pushing!

427
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,960
Please talk to us.

428
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,080
We just want an interview.

429
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,120
Mr. Daoming.

430
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,560
-Excuse me.
-Tell us where you've been.

431
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,200
-Tell us.
-Mr. Daoming.

432
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,320
-Talk to us.
-Mr. Daoming!

433
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,920
-Just a few words.
-Yes.

434
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Shancai!

435
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,080
Shancai!

436
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Shancai!

437
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,360
Shancai!

438
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,600
Daoming Si!

439
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,680
Daoming Si!

440
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,560
Talk to us.

441
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,880
Explain everything.

442
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,120
Mr. Daoming.

443
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,480
Talk to us.

444
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,680
-Mr. Daoming.
-Tell us where you've been.

445
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
Tell us.

446
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,120
Explain everything. Talk to us.

447
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,120
-Mr. Daoming.
-Sir!

448
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,040
Please talk to us. Si!

449
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,480
Shancai!

450
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,360
Shancai!

451
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,200
This is because you're Daoming Si.

452
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,320
-Help!
-He's bleeding!

453
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,560
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

454
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,760
-Help!
-Mr. Daoming!

455
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,360
-He's bleeding.
-Call an ambulance!

456
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
Daoming Si!

457
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,800
Daoming Si!
