A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 4

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,080
No.

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,560
This isn't what I want.

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,840
We're adults now.

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,000
As long as we're responsible,

7
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,880
we can do whatever we want.

8
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
If I didn't want to,

9
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,240
I wouldn't give you a chance.

10
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,080
Hey, do you want some grilled squid?

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,280
Wake up, Meizuo.

12
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,520
Get up, Meizuo.

13
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,320
What are you doing? Have some squid.

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,680
You're a pervert!

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,360
-Grilled squid time!
-Hey!

16
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
-What's your problem?
-Who wants some squid?

17
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,400
-It's so good.
-I...

18
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,320
Ximen!

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,440
What are you doing?

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Hey!

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,920
Ximen!

22
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Ximen!

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,120
What is wrong with you?
I was about to sleep.

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,840
-Grilled squid at this hour?
-Hey!

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
-Yes, grilled squid.
-I told you,

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
-I was about to sleep.
-Wake up!

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
-Get up!
-So annoying.

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,440
Get up!

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,600
Hey, get up!

30
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,960
Hey, Jing. Want some grilled squid?

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,360
Get up. Wake up!

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,920
I want this. This one?

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,880
Thanks. You're welcome.

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,800
Thank you.

35
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,040
You're so cute.

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,440
Shancai, do you want some grilled squid? No, thanks. I'll just have a drink.

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Okay. Thanks.

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
Here you go. Okay, thanks.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
Hurry up. All right.

40
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
-Thanks.
-Here.

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,360
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

42
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,960
Hey.

43
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,120
Look.

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
Do you know what this is?

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
-This...
-It's just a bucket.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
I mean, what's inside it?

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,320
Is it squid?

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,360
No.

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,680
It's the squid that I caught.

50
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Si.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Have you been fishing for squid all night?

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes. It's so much fun.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,920
Let's never hang out with him again, okay?

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Shancai.

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,440
What are you drinking?

56
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
This.

57
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,920
Did you see everything?

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
Yes.

59
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
I just wanted to return the dress.

61
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,560
I didn't mean to.

62
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,640
You...

63
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
You must hate me.

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
I know

65
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,240
I'm a lot of trouble.

66
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm hard to please

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,440
and I'm kind of selfish. But to me,

68
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
you're a very,

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,880
very important friend.

70
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
If I hate you,
why would I save you so many times?

71
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,480
Tell me.

72
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,160
When are you going to talk to him?

73
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
Well,

74
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,920
according to Si's logic,

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,040
they're not talking because

76
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,080
he forbade Lei from talking to him.

77
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,040
But Si can still talk to Lei.

78
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Cut it out.

79
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,680
I'll talk to him when I want to.

80
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,280
All of us pursue different kinds
of happiness in this world.

81
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
To me,

82
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,160
a smile from Lei is enough.

83
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,720
Si, you're early today.

84
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
I want to get there early.

85
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm happy that you're so energetic.

86
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
I'm happy for you.

87
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,160
The color of that tie
doesn't really go with your outfit.

88
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,080
It's not something you would wear.

89
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,400
It's fine.

90
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,040
I want to try something new today.

91
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
Oh? All right.

92
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,640
Your breakfast is here.

93
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
-Okay.
-I'll go now.

94
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Hey, Shancai.

95
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,000
Shancai.

96
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Shancai.

97
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,120
Good morning, Qinghe.

98
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Thank you for the trip.

99
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,120
Don't mention it.

100
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
I still can't forget how exciting
the last night in Sanya was.

101
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
That night in Sanya?

102
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,640
My aunts and uncles

103
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,640
heard that I won F4 over
with squid-fishing.

104
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They're so proud.

105
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,800
Is that what you're talking about?

106
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
Yes.

107
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,200
Didn't you see the squid I grilled?

108
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,200
All of them started drooling.

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,080
They loved it.

110
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,920
I've managed to make F4
like me with my food!

111
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
Good morning!

112
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Shancai, see?

113
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
They think of me as their friend now.

114
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,720
They never looked at me before.

115
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,680
Now, they hit my head.

116
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,720
That's something friends do.

117
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,600
Please turn in
your assignment from last week.

118
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,400
Pass it to your right to the class leader.

119
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,760
Shancai is getting out of hand.

120
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
First, she winked at Daoming Si
in front of you.

121
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,800
Next, she tackled him and kissed him.

122
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
This Shancai...

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,640
I can't tell her who to like or hit on.

124
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,320
But she's getting close to Huaze Lei
and seducing Daoming Si at the same time.

125
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
What is she doing? Yes.

126
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,200
She just wants to be popular.

127
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,320
If we knew they were going to Sanya,

128
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,920
we should've gone too.

129
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
Zhen.

130
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,480
Aren't you friends with Shancai?

131
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
Why didn't she bring you along?

132
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,200
Hello, sir.

133
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,320
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

134
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,440
That Shancai is so ridiculous.

135
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,720
This video has gone viral on Now Live.

136
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
She tackled and kissed Daoming Si
in public.

137
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah, what was she thinking?

138
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Unbelievable.

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,560
Where are my sneakers?

140
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Good morning, Shancai.

141
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,600
Daoming Si, why are you wearing my shoes?

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Are these your shoes?

143
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,760
No wonder they're kind of tight.

144
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,240
Daoming Si, is there something wrong
with you?

145
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
You're so immature for your age.

146
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I feel sorry for you.

147
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
Hey. I...

148
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,120
Hey. Hey.

149
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,200
Did you see her face?

150
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
She was so mad.

151
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,880
You woke us up so early today

152
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
just to see that?

153
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,080
Yes.

154
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,960
I didn't sleep last night
so I can do this to pick on her.

155
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
We should really think about

156
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,680
why we're friends
with someone so immature.

157
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Don't worry.
This is just the first part of my plan.

158
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
You have a plan?

159
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes.

160
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,080
My plan is to seduce her first,

161
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,280
mess around with her

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
and then dump her.

163
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,800
She'll be so sad.

164
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,760
Nobody up there or down there
will be able to help her.

165
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,200
I feel like you'll fall for her first.

166
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,320
Are you kidding?

167
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,960
Would I like someone that lame? Hey, where are you going?

168
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,200
Hey.

169
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,840
Hey.

170
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
Can you get me my shoes?

171
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,440
You're drawing Jing, aren't you?

172
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
You can tell? Does it look like her?

173
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,360
Yeah.

174
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,680
Are you sure?

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I've never been good at art.

176
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
Jing is probably
the only person you'd draw.

177
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,720
I guess so.

178
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,240
You have chalk dust on your head.

179
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
Where?

180
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
There. Where?

181
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,720
Can I...

182
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,880
Sure.

183
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,480
That's good. Thanks.

184
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,280
This is enough.

185
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
For me,

186
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,000
the time I spent with Lei on the rooftop

187
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
was probably the only time

188
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,280
I felt calm and relaxed at this school.

189
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,560
Look at him.

190
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400
How many times has he watched it?

191
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,720
I don't know.

192
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
But I do know that

193
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,720
when you like someone,
you have to follow her QQ space.

194
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,960
I think this time,
Si has really fallen for her.

195
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Daoming Si.

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,240
Do you remember me?

197
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,839
I'm Xinhui, a freshman
in the Nutrition Department.

198
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
I really like you.

199
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,240
And?

200
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,640
My classmate,
Shancai, has been rude to you.

201
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,560
I have a video of her to show you.

202
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,840
Hopefully, she'll stay out of trouble.

203
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Let me see.

204
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,160
No, it's for Daoming Si.

205
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Give it to me.

206
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
What's the big deal?

207
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
Yeah.

208
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,320
Shancai only touched Huaze Lei head.

209
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,880
They've been meeting
on the rooftop for a few times now.

210
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,640
Even though Huaze Lei likes Jing,

211
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,160
Shancai seems to be interested in him.

212
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,320
Shut up.

213
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,480
She kissed you once,
but now she's flirting with Huaze Lei.

214
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
I told you to shut up, didn't I?

215
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,880
Si, Xinhui s just trying to remind you

216
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,040
that Shancai isn't
as innocent as she looks.

217
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
You should be careful.

218
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Get out of the way.

219
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
-Shancai.
-Yes?

220
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,920
What are you wearing
to Jing's birthday party?

221
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
I don't know.

222
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
My mom said she would help me.

223
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,160
What about you?

224
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,800
I've already prepared a cool outfit.

225
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,840
I'll be the star of the show.

226
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,760
Zhen, Jing is having a party this weekend.

227
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,880
Do you want to come?

228
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,840
But she didn't invite me.

229
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,120
It's okay.
She said I could bring my friends.

230
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,680
Qinghe and Xiaoyou will be there.

231
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,320
We're all high-school classmates.
Let's go together.

232
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,800
Yeah, maybe we'll see
someone famous there.

233
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,720
All right.

234
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,760
Where's my notebook?

235
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,040
I left it on the rooftop.
I'm going to get it.

236
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,360
GIVE BACK TO YOUR PARENTS
FOR THEIR HARD WORK

237
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,920
MY DAD ALWAYS TELLS ME TO FOCUS ON
MY STUDIES WHILE HE WORKS MULTIPLE JOBS

238
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,600
CREDIT CARD HOLDER, LI ZHEN

239
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,560
This way, I can buy a dress
to wear to Jing's birthday party.

240
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,080
Daoming Si, what are you doing here?

241
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,680
Why are you here?

242
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,040
They were telling the truth.

243
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,880
Don't go.

244
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,640
What are you doing?

245
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,440
Shancai, you tricked me.

246
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,360
What are you talking about?
Who tricked you?

247
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
Hey!

248
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
You're a bad girl.

249
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
Why are you so mean?

250
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,760
What the hell are you talking about?

251
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,360
Let go!

252
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,520
I'm going to get angry.

253
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,760
I'm the one who should get angry.

254
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,480
How did I piss you off now?

255
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,040
Tell me.

256
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,520
Stop pretending.

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,440
You know what you're doing.

258
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Don't come near me.

259
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,440
It's all your fault!

260
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,280
Daoming Si.

261
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm begging you.

262
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,360
Please stop.

263
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,200
Stop crying.

264
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,160
I won't hurt you anymore.

265
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,160
Shancai's home.

266
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,000
Go wash your hands and get ready to eat.

267
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm not hungry. You're not hungry?

268
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,400
Are you on a diet?

269
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,800
No. Let me see.

270
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,120
Why is there blood here?

271
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
What happened? Tell me.

272
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,200
Is someone bullying you?
I'll go beat him up.

273
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,000
I tripped and fell.

274
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,160
It doesn't look like it.

275
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
Did someone hurt you?

276
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,680
No.

277
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,320
Stop lying.

278
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,080
That's enough.

279
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,040
She's always had a grumpy face.

280
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,280
You should know that.

281
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,320
-I guess so.
-All right.

282
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,560
That's enough.
I'm really tired. I want to go rest now.

283
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,600
Come out and eat later.

284
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,320
Lei.

285
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,120
I think Jing came back this time for you.

286
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,480
Really?

287
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,280
When are you going
to tell her how you feel?

288
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm thinking about it.

289
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
Si, what happened to your hand?

290
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
Did you hit Shancai?

291
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,200
Did you hit a wall?

292
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,880
I'm going to class now.

293
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,120
He probably hit both of them.

294
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,160
Lei.

295
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,680
What's going on with you and Shancai?

296
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,160
What?

297
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,280
What?

298
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,440
Why would Daoming Si do that to you?

299
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,520
Didn't you say that
you had grilled squid together in Sanya?

300
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,360
I'm confused.

301
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,800
He stole my sneakers
and was being all stupid about it.

302
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,480
The next second, he turns into a pervert.

303
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,440
Every time I close my eyes,

304
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,040
I can see his crazy eyes.

305
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,040
Then what happened?

306
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
There's nothing else.

307
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,040
I've been going to school really early
and coming straight home

308
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,480
so that I won't bump into him.

309
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,000
What about Jing's birthday party?

310
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
Will you see him there?

311
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm worried about that too.

312
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,400
It's fine. There'll be a lot of people.

313
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Just pretend you don't see him.

314
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
That's all I can do.

315
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,120
Shancai, you're wearing makeup now?

316
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,120
Wetcode Aqua Cushion CC Cream?

317
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,240
Last time in Sanya, Jing recommended it.

318
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,840
It's not bad.

319
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,600
It's very popular lately.

320
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,840
Let me see.

321
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Your skin looks flawless.

322
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,520
So moisturized.

323
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,000
Can I borrow it later?

324
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,240
Sure. No problem.

325
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,440
By the way, Shancai,

326
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,280
will that handsome guy, Ximen, be there?

327
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,440
Xiaoyou.

328
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,360
Wow.

329
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,560
Qinghe.

330
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,920
What an awesome car.

331
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
-What do you think? Cool, right?
-Yes.

332
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,720
My dad said for an occasion like this,

333
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,960
I have to drive Qinghe number two.

334
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,240
-What about Qinghe number one?
-That's me.

335
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,720
Silly girl.

336
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,120
Shancai.

337
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,600
-Wow.
-Hey.

338
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,160
What do you think? Do I look weird?

339
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,000
No. You look great.

340
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,200
Wow, so pretty.

341
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,040
WOMEN'S DRESS, 5,998 YUAN

342
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,560
You can pay in installments
with a credit card.

343
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,080
With 12 installments,
it's only a few hundred yuan a month.

344
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,000
How are you paying?

345
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,960
Can I use my Bank of Communications app?

346
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,360
Of course.

347
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,320
BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS APP

348
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,320
Everyone looks wonderful.

349
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,400
They're dressed so formally.

350
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,560
Do you think we're dressed up enough?

351
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,120
Why not?

352
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,520
At least, I look good.

353
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,280
Isn't that the actress, Zhou Dongyu?

354
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,120
So pretty.

355
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
Calm down, Xiaoyou.

356
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,120
My dad said at events like this,
if you see someone famous,

357
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,920
you should pretend you didn't see them.

358
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,080
We should get something to eat first.

359
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,120
Come on.

360
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,720
There's so much food.

361
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
-Which one do you want?
-This one.

362
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,840
It's Ximen.

363
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,440
He's so handsome.

364
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,280
Which one is Si?

365
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,560
-Si.
-Si...

366
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,840
Do you see that pineapple head?

367
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
That's Daoming Si.

368
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,480
One time, we went squid-fishing
and I caught way more than him.

369
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,400
His squid was smaller than...

370
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,880
Than what?

371
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
My finger.

372
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,600
Shancai.

373
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,400
You look very elegant today.

374
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,480
Yes, very cute.

375
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,000
Daoming Si, you're still so handsome.

376
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,199
I just came back from London last month.

377
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,880
I went to Fashion Week there.
I saw your sister.

378
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
She's still so beautiful.

379
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,159
I bought this dress I'm wearing
over there.

380
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,239
What do you think?

381
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,639
Shancai.

382
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
What are you doing?

383
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,760
Isn't it nice?

384
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,040
What are you up to lately?

385
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,280
You should come out with us.

386
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,120
You never hang out with us anymore.

387
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
Next time when you're free,
don't forget to call me.

388
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
Lei, don't be sad.

389
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,080
I'll be back.

390
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,080
Welcome. This way, please.

391
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,880
Please show your invitation.

392
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,600
My friend has it. She's inside.

393
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,520
-Can you let me in?
-I'm sorry.

394
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,120
You need an invitation to get in.

395
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,560
Excuse me, please step aside.

396
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,120
Ms. Li, you look wonderful.
Let me see that.

397
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
Welcome.

398
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
Sir, hello.

399
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,840
Invitation, please.

400
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
Mr. Wang, hello.

401
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,960
Ms. Wang, you look beautiful tonight.
It has been a while.

402
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,960
Please come in.

403
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,040
This way, please. I'm sorry.

404
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,720
I didn't do it on purpose.

405
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,800
What have you done?

406
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,360
This is an expensive suit.

407
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,360
What are you going to do now?

408
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,320
It was an accident.

409
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Don't worry.

410
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
It's fine.

411
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,640
How about

412
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,480
you wipe it clean for me?

413
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,080
Is that okay?

414
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,880
I'll wipe it for you.

415
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,080
But your suit is flimsy.

416
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
The texture is terrible.

417
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,760
You should just toss it.

418
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,120
What a rude boy.

419
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,720
It's none of your business.

420
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,520
Has my phone died again?

421
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Where's Xiaoyou?

422
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,640
-The number you dialed is...
-Okay, thanks.

423
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,440
Please try again later.

424
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
I go to Mingde University,
the same school Jing goes to.

425
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,280
My friend is inside.

426
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,200
Can you let me in?

427
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,320
Miss, please don't cause any trouble.

428
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,960
Show your invitation
or ask your friend to come get you, okay?

429
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,520
-But I--
-Don't get in the way.

430
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,360
Sir, invitation, please.

431
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,920
Welcome.

432
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,000
Ms. Li, you look fabulous.

433
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,000
This way, please.

434
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,440
Ms. Zhao, hello.

435
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,480
Invitation, please.

436
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,960
Welcome.

437
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Ms. Li, it has been a while.

438
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,960
Are you okay, Ms. Milk Tea?

439
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
Thank you.

440
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,120
You remember me?

441
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,360
You're cute. Of course I remember you.

442
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,600
Are you free later?

443
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,040
-What?
-I'm a tea expert.

444
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,480
-Maybe later we can--
-What do you want?

445
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,440
We're in public.

446
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,960
What can I do?

447
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,120
Don't talk to him.

448
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,080
If you talk to him, you'll get pregnant.

449
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,000
Hey.

450
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm very careful, okay?

451
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,800
Ignore him.

452
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,720
But I think he's handsome.

453
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,160
His voice is mesmerizing.

454
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,920
He seems more composed than Daoming Si.

455
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,040
Xiaoyou, get yourself together.

456
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,360
Where's your phone?

457
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,840
I need to call Zhen.

458
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
My phone is dead again.

459
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,120
Here.

460
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,440
-Hello?
-Zhen, where are you?

461
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,680
-I'm sorry, my phone died--
-I called you to say

462
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,720
that something came up. I can't go.

463
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,360
What? You can't come?

464
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,560
Yes.

465
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Have fun.

466
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,880
Hey, I have something to tell you.

467
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,760
What is it? Nothing.

468
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,680
-Shancai.
-What's up with him?

469
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,840
Who knows?

470
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Daoming Si just taught me
how to make girls like me.

471
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,560
How?

472
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
I'll tell you later.

473
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,320
She's so beautiful.
