1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,040
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
Fine.

4
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,680
If you don't know how to play Bridge,

5
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,320
you can set the rules.

6
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
I'll decide what you wager.

7
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Is that fair?

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,600
They're setting the rules?

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm never unfair to people.

10
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,720
You mean, we're not playing Bridge?

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,720
We could play Five-card stud.

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,199
What stud?

13
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,560
What can you play?

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,160
We'll compare hands.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
What?

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Compare hands?

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,560
We'll each pick a card
and compare them to see who wins.

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,560
Do you think this is kindergarten?

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,800
You said we could set the rules.

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
All right.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
We'll compare hands.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
-Why aren't they out yet?
-Who won?

23
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
I think so too.

24
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,200
Shancai could never win, right?

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,720
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,240
There's something wrong with her.

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Regardless of which game,
F4 has never lost before.

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
One round. Go.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,880
Pick a card.

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
I only get one chance.

31
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
Which one should I pick?

32
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,680
We'll lose if I choose the wrong card.

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm so nervous.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
This one?

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
Or this one?

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
I can't decide.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
Hey.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,280
Are you done yet?

39
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,000
Ace of hearts.

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,400
You got the ace of hearts. We won!

41
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,200
How about that?

42
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,960
We win, unless you get the ace of spades.

43
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Which is impossible.

44
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,720
Your turn.

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,600
How is that possible?

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,480
Wait.

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,720
You shuffled the cards.
What if you're cheating?

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Five of clubs.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Six of diamonds.

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Eight of hearts.

51
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
Jack of spades.

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,400
Two of spades.

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
Ten of diamonds.

54
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,440
Three of clubs, nine of diamonds,
five of hearts, king of hearts.

55
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,280
Wait.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,680
You don't have
the ace of spades. You lose.

57
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,800
That's because it's in your pocket.

58
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,000
Why is it in my pocket?

59
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,760
Who put it in there?

60
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Do you think the champion team
of the World Bridge Competition

61
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,840
would lose to you?

62
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,200
Meizuo has impeccable eyes.

63
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,120
He's second to none.

64
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,040
No matter what we play,
you'll lose for sure.

65
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
So? Another round?

66
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,680
We lost.

67
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,800
What do you want?

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
This is between you and Si.

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,720
We'll back out of this.

70
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,760
What do you mean it's between them?

71
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
What about me?

72
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,880
Hey. What are you doing?

73
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
What will you do to Shancai? Hey!

74
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Let go!

75
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
Let go of me!

76
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
Daoming Si, come at me if you want!

77
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,160
Don't touch Shancai!

78
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Let go!

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,760
What are you doing?

80
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,640
Let go!

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,160
So, what do you want from me?

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,080
Do I have to eat some slippers?

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
What do you want?

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
Treat me to dinner. What did you say?

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Stop pretending you can't hear me.

86
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
You did that last time at the airport.
Now you're doing it again.

87
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,840
It's infuriating.

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
Treat. Me.

89
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
To. Dinner!

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
Did you hear me?

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
QQ MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,240
See you at 12:00 p.m.
at the Jiangwan Stadium Plaza.

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
What does he want?

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,320
So weird.

95
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,960
Oh, it's Qinghe.

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,640
Shancai, are you okay?

97
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,520
Ximen and Meizuo just let me go.

98
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
I've been worried sick.

99
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,880
Did they make you eat something weird?

100
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,120
Should we go to the hospital?

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,440
I would rather eat slippers.

102
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,560
What?

103
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,200
You ate slippers?

104
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
No, I mean--

105
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,480
Hello?

106
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,080
Hello?

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,200
Hello?

108
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,200
Stupid Si.

109
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
He's going to find
a way to bully me again.

110
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
My phone is broken because of him.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm not going.

112
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,200
Let's see what he'll do.

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,560
SHANGHAI INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL HUB

114
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Shancai, what do you think of this one?

115
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,880
It's nice. You can buy it if you like it.

116
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,360
We've been shopping for hours now.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,640
You can't rush shopping.

118
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
It'll affect your decisions.

119
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,640
Shancai, look.

120
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,320
Isn't this one nice?

121
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,480
Here. Try it on.

122
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,960
This... It's so expensive.

123
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,880
Don't worry about that.

124
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Hurry up and try it.

125
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
-Hurry.
-Okay.

126
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,880
It's getting colder. You need new clothes.

127
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,480
You can't always wear your old ones.

128
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,880
I know it would look nice.

129
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,640
Even though you aren't
as pretty as your mom,

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,080
your figure is acceptable.

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,800
It's raining.

132
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Is he waiting for me?

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,240
Mom, I need to be somewhere.

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,560
I'll meet up with you later.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Hey, I haven't paid for that yet.

136
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,920
Silly girl. We only have one umbrella.
How will I get home?

137
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
He's still there.

138
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,200
Why are you standing here?

139
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
What are you doing? Let go. It's cold.

140
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,920
Do you know what time it is?
I've been waiting for three hours.

141
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
I never said I would come.

142
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
You lost. You don't get to decide.

143
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,880
You bought new clothes for our date?

144
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
It's only 799 yuan? That's cheap.

145
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,680
You should go home.

146
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
Why did you keep waiting?

147
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,920
I couldn't reach you on your phone.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,880
I was worried you came
and couldn't find me

149
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
or that you had an accident.

150
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
I couldn't leave even
when it started to rain.

151
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,120
Fine.

152
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,920
-Let's go indoors.
-Okay.

153
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,120
Over here.

154
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,280
Let me hold that. Silly girl.

155
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,080
Where are we going?

156
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
-To get food.
-What?

157
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,560
Where are you taking me?

158
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,240
I know this place.

159
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
They have delicious food.

160
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
It's only 50 yuan per person.

161
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,160
Fifty yuan?

162
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Are we having grass or something?

163
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,040
They have lots of options. It's great.

164
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,760
Let's go.

165
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,440
Can't you walk faster?

166
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,440
-Fine.
-You're so slow.

167
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,080
That's weird...

168
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,440
The shops aren't open here.

169
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,200
Thank god. Let's go.

170
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
-No.
-Why?

171
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I know another place.

172
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,000
They have good noodles.

173
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Let's go. Come on.

174
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
It's delicious.

175
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,120
-Hurry up.
-Fine.

176
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
What's going on?

177
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
Over there. This way.

178
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,720
UNDER RENOVATION

179
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,760
I know another place up there that's good.

180
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
-Come on.
-We're going up again?

181
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,920
We can take the elevator.

182
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
Hurry up.

183
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,040
ELEVATOR UNDER MAINTENANCE
DO NOT USE

184
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,560
Nobody dares to let me go hungry.

185
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
Food's more delicious when you're hungry.

186
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,440
What? Is this stupid elevator broken?

187
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
That's ridiculous.

188
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Is anyone there?

189
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,440
Help! -Hey.
-Hey.

190
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
Help! Is anyone there?

191
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,040
Hey. Help!

192
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
Help!

193
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,560
I think it's broken.

194
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,920
Are you kidding me?

195
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,080
What a stupid elevator.

196
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,920
Stop that, okay?

197
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,960
If the elevator falls, we'll die.

198
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
Then what are we supposed to do now?

199
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,880
My stupid phone is dead again.

200
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,000
Where's your phone?

201
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,120
I called you for four hours straight.

202
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
What do you think?

203
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,040
Then...

204
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,440
We'll have to wait here.

205
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,840
Hello, Li Zhen?

206
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm Shancai's mom.

207
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
Yes. I'm her mom.

208
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,120
Did Shancai call you?

209
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,040
She's not picking up?

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,160
I know. I've been calling her too.

211
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,960
She hasn't picked up.
She hasn't called back either.

212
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay.

213
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,600
If she calls you, let me know.

214
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,680
Okay. Thanks.

215
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,400
Hey. Help!

216
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,360
Can't you see we're stuck?

217
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,600
Hey.

218
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,600
Dear,

219
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,360
something's wrong.

220
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,640
Shancai hasn't called me yet.

221
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,320
She isn't picking up.

222
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,760
I called Li Zhen,
she hasn't heard from Shancai either.

223
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,880
She's really lost.

224
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,600
Where are you? Why aren't you home yet?

225
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,360
You're at the BBQ stand?

226
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,640
BBQ...

227
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,600
Can you bring some home?

228
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
With no pepper.

229
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Okay.

230
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,760
Why am I crying?

231
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Do you think I want to cry?

232
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,280
These onions are really something.

233
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,720
Hey.

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What are you doing?

235
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey.

236
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,640
What's wrong with you?

237
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,040
Your clothes are drenched.

238
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,520
You have a fever.

239
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
Try standing in the rain for four hours.

240
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,560
Lie down.

241
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,119
You should get some rest.

242
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
Try to stay conscious.

243
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,160
Someone will come for us soon.

244
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,960
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,640
This is all my fault.

246
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
But you're the one

247
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
who insisted on coming here.

248
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,480
If you didn't insist on coming here,

249
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,360
we wouldn't be stuck here.

250
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,520
What's so funny?

251
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm hungry and tired and I was in the rain for so long.

252
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
It's normal that my stomach is growling.

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Okay.

254
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,600
Right now, I'm the only one
that can take care of you.

255
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
When you get home,
your mom will take care of you.

256
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,800
I haven't seen my mom for two years.

257
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Two years?

258
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
My dad...

259
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,800
He died when I was in middle school.

260
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,040
My mom had to work in London.

261
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,080
When we called her,
we always got her assistant instead.

262
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,360
So we stopped calling.

263
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,920
It must be lonely living
in such a big house by yourself.

264
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,520
Don't say that.

265
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,280
I'm never lonely.

266
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,800
If I were you,

267
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,160
I would feel very lonely.

268
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,160
I would probably become rebellious.

269
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay.

270
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,520
I admit it was my fault this time.

271
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,760
How can I make it up to you?

272
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,920
Hey.

273
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
That's not what I meant...

274
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Hey. What are you doing?

275
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,680
It's nice to be young.

276
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,120
Is this the police?

277
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,600
My daughter is around 160cm.

278
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,600
She has a round face.

279
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
She had a big coat on.

280
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,520
What? Her main features?

281
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,840
She has a big butt.

282
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,040
How can you say that about her?

283
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,040
Hello, sir.

284
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,720
Yes, I'm her dad.

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,640
Yes.

286
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,520
My daughter is very pretty.

287
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,800
She's around 160cm.

288
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,840
She has big, round eyes.

289
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,040
Everyone loves her.

290
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
She has pale skin, and--

291
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,640
They won't find her like that.

292
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,080
-But--
-Mom, Dad.

293
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,680
See? She's home.

294
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,680
I was right about her having a big butt.

295
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
Shancai, you're home?

296
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,680
-How dare you?
-Mom, stop it.

297
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,920
-Stop it.
-How could you do this?

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,440
-You couldn't call us?
-Stop it.

299
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
You always hit me in the end.

300
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,120
-Get out of the way.
-Mom.

301
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,240
I was stuck in an elevator

302
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,640
-the whole night.
-You couldn't call us?

303
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,040
My phone is broken.

304
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,840
The elevator broke
and your phone broke too?

305
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
You're lying. You're a bad girl.

306
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,560
No, I'm not.

307
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,880
See? My phone is broken.

308
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,360
It is...

309
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
So you were trapped
in the elevator the whole night?

310
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Yes.

311
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,760
All right, come out.

312
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,800
You didn't come home all night.
Do you know how worried we were?

313
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,360
-Sweetheart.
-We were worried sick.

314
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,680
-It's fine.
-Here.

315
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,560
Fine. You can use my phone for now.

316
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,840
Thanks, Mom.

317
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Shancai, are you hungry?

318
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,920
The porridge is cold. I'll heat it up.

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
I'll get you a bowl.

320
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Aren't you heating the porridge?
What's the bowl for?

321
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,560
I'm pouring water, okay?

322
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
-Silly woman.
-You're the silly one.

323
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,960
Who needs water to heat up porridge?

324
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
My house is small.

325
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,640
My parents are always bickering.

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
But they really care about me.

327
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I don't know if anyone

328
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
will take care of him at home.

329
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,640
Or if his fever has gone down.

330
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,200
Hey, Li Zhen.

331
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,320
-Did Shancai's mom call you last night?
-Yes.

332
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,080
She said she didn't come home all night

333
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,720
and asked me where she was.

334
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,120
I couldn't reach her either.

335
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,680
-What about you?
-I couldn't either.

336
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
I called her all night.
She never picked up.

337
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,040
What happened?

338
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,160
Shancai has never been like this.

339
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,760
I know.

340
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,800
It must be Daoming Si.

341
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,200
He said if we lost,
he could decide what to do to us.

342
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,800
I waited all day but nothing happened.

343
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,160
He must have gone after Shancai.

344
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,520
Jerk!

345
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Qinghe, wait.

346
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,800
Hey.

347
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,840
Shancai.

348
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
-Shancai.
-Quiet now, everyone.

349
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,960
-Shancai.
-Class is starting.

350
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,160
The professor is here.

351
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,320
All right.

352
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,960
In the last class,
we talked about nutrition in food.

353
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Today...

354
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,640
I heard Mr. Liu say you're sick.

355
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,160
How did you get sick on a date?

356
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
You get sick when you're weak.

357
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,360
Especially when you're exhausted.

358
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,520
What are you talking about?

359
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,320
Where did you go with Shancai?

360
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
Did you follow the plan we made for you?

361
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,720
We were trapped
in an elevator the whole night.

362
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,720
-An elevator?
-An elevator?

363
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
Wow, so exciting.

364
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,160
How was it?

365
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,800
It was cold.

366
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
And Shancai gave me her clothes.

367
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,600
And I started feeling very hot.

368
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,000
I was sweating all over, so...

369
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
What happened in the end?

370
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,640
I thought something
would happen in the end.

371
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,640
But then...

372
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,160
The workers came and found us.

373
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,600
You're such a weird couple.

374
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,240
Weird?

375
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm still mad at that elevator worker.

376
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,360
Class,

377
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,240
these are the six essentials
for the human body.

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,720
Now, I'll give you ten minutes
to read your book

379
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,560
and go over what we just talked about.

380
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,120
Xinhui.

381
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,160
Look at her.

382
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,520
I wonder how Daoming Si
punished her last night.

383
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,960
She shouldn't have challenged F4.

384
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,840
She dug her own grave.

385
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm so mad.

386
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
Look how tired she looks.

387
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,600
Daoming Si must have
bullied her last night.

388
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,880
All right, that's all for today.

389
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
Class dismissed.

390
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,320
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

391
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,920
Your mom said you didn't come home.

392
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
Where did you go?

393
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,120
-I...
-Daoming Si kidnapped you, didn't he?

394
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,760
Did he make you do something weird?

395
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,560
Or eat something weird?

396
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,760
Shancai, don't worry.

397
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,800
I'm your humble servant.

398
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,280
I'll get them back for this.

399
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,480
That's enough.

400
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm fine.

401
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,720
Don't worry.

402
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,560
It's not what you think.

403
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Daoming Si didn't bully me.

404
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,680
All right, Shancai.

405
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,760
Stop pretending.

406
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,960
It's okay that you lost the challenge.

407
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,240
Yeah, Shancai.

408
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,560
If you told us earlier,

409
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,800
maybe we could've talked
Daoming Si out of it.

410
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,800
Shancai, Daoming Si is looking for you.

411
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,600
Come on, let's go.

412
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,400
Excuse me.

413
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,160
What do you want?

414
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
Here.

415
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,880
What is it?

416
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,840
I won't accept a gift from you.

417
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,360
Idiot.

418
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,680
Who said it's a gift?

419
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
It's your coat.

420
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,360
You forgot to take it
when you left this morning.

421
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,280
Hey. Snap out of it.

422
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,040
Last night,

423
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,920
did Shancai sleep with Daoming Si?

424
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,720
It says here in QQ Space
that they're dating.

425
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,360
To be honest,

426
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,560
I don't like this girl.

427
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Can we stop talking to her?

428
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
Why?

429
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,520
If she's close to F4,

430
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,760
I want to be friends with her.

431
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,640
I can't take it anymore!

432
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,760
Shancai, you said
that Daoming Si didn't bully you.

433
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,080
But he did.

434
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
Did he?

435
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
Did he not?

436
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,000
Why did he have your coat?

437
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,800
He's a big guy.

438
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,560
Your coat is too small.

439
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,480
He probably wanted to ruin your coat. Such a pervert.

440
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,040
"Shancai, I'm so cold.

441
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,040
Give me your coat.

442
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,840
Shancai, I'm so cold.

443
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
Give me your dress too."

444
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,640
His intentions aren't pure.

445
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,280
Li Zhen, isn't he disgusting?

446
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,240
You're exaggerating.

447
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,000
He's ridiculous.

448
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Shancai, tell us.

449
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,040
Why did he have your coat?

450
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,120
I gave him the coat because--

451
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,240
Shancai.

452
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Ever since school started,

453
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,400
we haven't really hung out together.

454
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,160
How about we go have some fun tonight?

455
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,640
Xinhui only hangs out
with a selective group.

456
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,160
You'll be there, won't you?

457
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,800
Are you too ashamed of us because
you're friends with Daoming Si now?

458
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,760
That's not true.

459
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,800
So, where are we going?

460
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Tonight, let's have a ladies' night.

461
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,360
What?

462
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,080
So I can't go?

463
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
What are you looking at?

464
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,280
No wonder you came to school sick.

465
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,360
You couldn't wait
to declare your territory.

466
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,800
Declare my territory?

467
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,520
You went on a date
with Shancai last night.

468
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,760
And today, everyone says you're dating.

469
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,600
If I don't tell the world who I like,

470
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,040
I'd be waiting for someone to steal her.

471
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,160
-What are you doing tonight?
-I don't know.

472
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,000
-Where are you going?
-What are you up to?

473
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,040
-Chill at my place?
-Hey.

474
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,000
Good idea.

475
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,160
-You're leaving me?
-Okay.

476
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,080
Hey. Shancai.

477
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,400
You can go dance.
I'll just stay here. It's fine.

478
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,440
It's okay.

479
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
I can't dance.

480
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,560
We'll just have our drinks here.

481
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Okay.

482
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,440
Cheers.

483
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Cheers.

484
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,560
-Let's go.
-Sure.

485
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,040
Why aren't you guys dancing?

486
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,240
We can't dance.

487
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,440
You're pretty and have nice bodies.

488
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
You're cool too, Shancai.

489
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,040
Tell me, how did you get
Daoming Si to like you?

490
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,360
Xinhui.

491
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,560
It's not like that with Daoming Si and me.

492
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,040
Daoming Si isn't my boyfriend.

493
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,240
Shancai, do you think we're stupid?

494
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,680
We saw Daoming Si give your coat back.

495
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,480
QQ Space says that you're dating.

496
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,720
He hasn't denied it.

497
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,480
Why are you denying it?

498
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,840
It's not true.

499
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,720
It's a misunderstanding.

500
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,840
Fine.

501
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,200
If Daoming Si isn't your boyfriend,

502
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,600
you should introduce him to us.

503
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,920
Do we have a deal?

504
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
Everyone heard it here.

505
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Let's drink to it.

506
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
Let's thank Shancai.

507
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,080
Cheers.

508
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,520
This drink is pretty good.

509
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,040
I feel so hot.

510
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm going to the restroom.

511
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Shancai.

512
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,400
I like you.

513
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,160
Isn't that Shancai?

514
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah.

515
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,560
She's leaning on
the long-haired foreign pianist.

516
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,480
Isn't she your good friend?

517
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,640
She's crazy.

518
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
She's not good at anything,

519
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,080
but she's good
at throwing herself at boys.

520
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
Where am I?

521
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,840
You were drunk. Call me when you wake up.

522
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,800
Thomas. Thomas?

523
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,840
Who the hell is Thomas?

524
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,000
-Hi.
-Hi.

525
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,880
We're friends with Shancai.

526
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm Baihe. This is Xinhui.

527
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,000
What's your name?

528
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,320
Call me Thomas.

529
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Nice to meet you.

530
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,800
Shancai, too.

531
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,800
-Let's take a photo.
-Okay.

532
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,800
Okay.

533
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,600
What?

534
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
That foreigner and I...

535
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,080
Hello? Thomas?

536
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,520
You're awake? I'll go see you.

537
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,560
Don't, I'm at school now.

538
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,880
Okay.

539
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,480
Last night,

540
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,840
how did I get to the hotel?

541
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,760
Where did my friends go?

542
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,520
They were drunk.
They asked me to take care of you.

543
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,480
I didn't know where you lived.

544
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,320
So I brought you to a hotel.

545
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,640
Hey.

546
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
Why are you so late?

547
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
None of your business.

548
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,960
You have your first class at eight.

549
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
You were almost late.

550
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,240
None of your business.

551
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,320
Wait.

552
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,480
You know my schedule?

553
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,920
I didn't. Ximen told me.

554
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,960
Go away.

555
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,840
Why are you following me?

556
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,960
Were you waiting for me there?

557
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,680
You wish.

558
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,400
I'm going to the administration building.
I just passed by.

559
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,000
The administration building? That's in the opposite direction.

560
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,480
I like taking the long way there.

561
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,240
Whatever.

562
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,400
I'm going to class. Wait.

563
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,160
Here.

564
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,760
What's this?

565
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,720
Next time you give me your clothes,
at least make it an expensive one.

566
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,320
It's getting cold. Put it on.

567
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,840
Do you need help?

568
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,480
No. I'm going to be late.

569
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,440
All right, class.

570
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,440
That's all for today.

571
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,320
Please send me your assignments.

572
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Class dismissed.

573
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,120
Li Zhen.

574
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,840
When did you go home last night?

575
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,200
Why didn't you tell me? I don't remember.

576
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
I had a bit too much to drink.

577
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,080
It seemed like
you were having a good time.

578
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,600
So I went home.

579
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
Okay.

580
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,800
Shancai.

581
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,440
Was it fun last night? Where did you go?

582
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
THOMAS

583
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,040
Hello?

584
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
Shancai, where are you? Your school is so big.

585
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,960
I think I'm lost.

586
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,000
You're...

587
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,600
You're at my school?

588
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,800
Yeah. Where can I meet you?

589
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
The cafeteria.

590
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,680
Shancai, where are you going?
