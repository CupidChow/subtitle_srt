A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
Where is he?

4
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,240
What? Are you looking for me? In your dreams.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,760
Hey, who are you looking for then?

6
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Go and sit. I'm...

7
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
You look pretty nice today.

8
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Sit down.

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,360
What do you want?

10
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,480
I ordered too much. Eat.

11
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm not hungry.

12
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,680
I don't care. You can only go
after you finish eating.

13
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,960
You're too skinny.
I'm going to make you fatter.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,240
Why do you want to do that? I'm not a pig.

15
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
Are you sure you're not?

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,840
You're the pig.

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,240
I wish someone would make me
fat like a pig.

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,760
That's right. I've known you forever,
but never saw you so considerate.

19
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
Shut up, you two.

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,320
Eat up.

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
All right. I'll just eat the ribs.

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
How much was the jacket?
I'll pay you back.

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,720
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,440
I was never taught to ask the girl to pay.

25
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,360
Shancai still doesn't admit
that Daoming Si is his boyfriend?

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,680
She says one thing, but does another.

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
Do you believe her?

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Who knows what's on her mind?

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,800
What? You're not hungry? Look at you.

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Slow down.

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,560
-Hello?
-Where are you?

32
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm near the cafeteria. I'll come up.

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
No!

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,560
Don't come here. I'll go to you.

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
Was that a guy or a girl?

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,600
None of your business.

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm warning you.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,560
You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm full. I have to go.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
Hey, where are you going?

41
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Hey, Shancai.

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Shancai, I'm--

43
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,560
-Come with me.
-Where to?

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,920
Hey.

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Isn't that Thomas from last night?

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,519
He came to school.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,440
A minute ago,
she was eating with Daoming Si.

48
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,079
Now, she's going on a date with Thomas.

49
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
That Shancai sure is something.

50
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,040
Hey, why did you come to our school?

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,720
You called me,
but didn't finish what you were saying.

52
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,280
I was worried something had happened.

53
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
Did you do something bad to me?

54
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
-Of course I did.
-What?

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,440
You puked everywhere.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
You were filthy.

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,320
I cleaned you up
and let you rest on the bed.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
And?

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,720
And then, I left the hotel.

60
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Really?

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Really.

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,800
All right. That's good then.

63
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,360
-I need to go.
-Hey.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Wait, Shancai.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,880
You put your head on my shoulder
that day and said

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,520
that you like me.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,240
Is it true?

68
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Sorry. I got confused.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,960
I like you too.

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,680
Why don't you go out with me?

71
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,360
I mistook you for someone else that day.

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,480
What are you two doing? Daoming Si.

73
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
Who is this guy?

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm warning you.

75
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,840
You're dead meat
if you do anything with another guy.

76
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
He's...

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,440
He's just asking for directions.

78
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,200
Directions?

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Why did he grab your shoulders?

80
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
I'll ask him. Hello.

81
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,040
I was asking her for directions.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,800
Listen carefully.

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,280
She's my woman. Don't touch her.

84
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,480
So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.

85
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
That's too bad.

86
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,280
What's too bad?

87
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm warning you.

88
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
Stay away from her.

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm going.

90
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,920
Hey.

91
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
Daoming Si.

92
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,560
What language were you two using?

93
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,760
French.

94
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,560
You actually know French?

95
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
What's so surprising?

96
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,800
As the heir of the Daoming Group,
it's normal to know many languages.

97
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,200
Really?

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
Then...

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,040
What were you two talking about?

100
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,320
I told him you're my girlfriend
and asked him to get lost.

101
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,440
What? Why are you making up stories?

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
He's obviously taking advantage of you
and pretending to be lost.

103
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
You're so naive. How silly!

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,360
You're the silly one.

105
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm not dating you.
Why do you keep butting in?

106
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,600
We're not going out?

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,920
Hey!

108
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
What the hell?

109
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
He's making me feel guilty.

110
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
MINGDE UNIVERSITY POKER CLUB

111
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
What? This is unbelievable.

112
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,200
What is it?

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,280
-My gosh.
-Hey, did you guys see?

114
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
-Yes.
-Wow.

115
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,040
I can't believe she did that.

116
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,960
Look.

117
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
That's her.

118
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,560
Isn't that her?

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,120
I don't believe it.

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Isn't that her?

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Yeah.

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
-It's her.
-It's her.

123
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,240
-Yes.
-It's her.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,280
Don't be ridiculous.

125
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
Shancai would never do that.

126
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,440
We're not making it up.

127
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,960
She really did lean
on the foreigner that day.

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,720
Yes. I even have a photo of her
dancing with Thomas.

129
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,720
See?

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
You're lying.

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
That's not Shancai.

132
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,840
The photo is fake.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
There's the girl we're talking about.
Ask her yourself.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,760
Dong Shancai.

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,640
You spent the night with Thomas, right?

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Look at this.

137
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,360
UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,600
AND SPENDS A NIGHT WITH A FRENCH GUY?

139
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
See?

140
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
She's not denying it.

141
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,280
You're the only one
who still thinks she's innocent.

142
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
Why did you two set me up?

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,000
Shancai, we're not the ones
who posted the photos.

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
Don't yell at us.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Right.

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,000
You're responsible for your own actions.

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,280
I can't believe you did that
to Daoming Si.

148
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,160
Stop harassing her!

149
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Shancai.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,120
This is a misunderstanding, right?

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
Just explain it to them.

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,960
Shancai!

153
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Hello. Do you know the long-haired
pianist named Thomas?

154
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,880
Do you know where he is?

155
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,400
-Thomas?
-Yes.

156
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
That foreigner just filled in for the day.

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,800
I'm not sure where he is.

158
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
Isn't Si acting weird?

159
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,840
He's been swimming
back and forth for an hour.

160
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm not surprised.

161
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,640
He must have been annoyed
by Shancai again.

162
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,880
I thought Si would've gotten Shancai
in the elevator that night.

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,680
I didn't think he'd drag it out like this.

164
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Logically speaking,

165
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,760
any girl who has gone out with an F4
would always call back.

166
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,960
They'd ask when the second date is.

167
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,440
-How many girls called you today?
-Do you want to see?

168
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
No way.

169
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
-What?
-Look at this.

170
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,080
What the hell is wrong with you?
We're too old for pranks like that.

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
Where's my phone?

172
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,000
Sorry.

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,720
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please try again later.

174
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Sorry.

175
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,280
The person you have reached...

176
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,320
What is the photo about? Why did you frame me?

177
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,360
Shancai. We saw the photo.

178
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,520
What happened
between you and that foreigner?

179
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
It's not true.

180
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
It's a misunderstanding.

181
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,240
That night,

182
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Xinhui, Baihe, and Li Zhen

183
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
went out for a ladies' night. I did dance with that guy.

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
But nothing else happened.

185
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,320
So what's the photo about?

186
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm not sure.

187
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,040
Sorry.

188
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,480
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

189
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,880
Please try again later.

190
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
Why would Daoming Si fall
for a shameless girl like her?

191
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Dong Shancai,
you should be ashamed of yourself.

192
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,560
You've embarrassed Mingde.

193
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,880
Dong Shancai, whom are you really dating?

194
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,560
Do you like Daoming Si or that foreigner?

195
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,880
I wonder what Daoming Si sees in you.

196
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Poor Si. I can't believe he likes you.

197
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,760
How did it end up like this?

198
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
I must not run.

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,120
Running away means I'm guilty.

200
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,120
I didn't do anything wrong.
Why should I hide?

201
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,600
-It's her.
-Yes. Ignore her.

202
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,880
-How dare she show up?
-Right?

203
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,320
Excuse me.

204
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,840
She's sitting in front.

205
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,400
She's really sitting here.

206
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,800
-Should we move?
-Gosh.

207
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,560
-Let's go.
-Come on.

208
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,360
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

209
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,400
Go.

210
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,320
Damn you. Why won't you answer my calls?

211
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
Are you hiding from me?

212
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,760
Why did you post that photo online?

213
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,360
Face me in person
instead of playing dirty!

214
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
What kind of a man are you?

215
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
REENACTING ENGLISH SCENARIO

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,400
Let's have two students come up
for an impromptu session.

217
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,840
You should call up Shancai.
Her English is excellent.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,880
-Okay.
-Right?

219
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,480
Yes, her English is outstanding.

220
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,880
Yes, let her do it.

221
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
She knows a lot of foreigners.

222
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm sure she learned something.

223
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,520
Hey, stop making up stories, okay?

224
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,720
I didn't make it up.

225
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,240
Did I make it up?

226
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Let's go.

227
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,359
So I don't think Thomas lives in Shanghai.

228
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
He's probably gone back to France.

229
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
I think one of Thomas' friends
shared the photos,

230
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,680
and they were set up.

231
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760
I wonder

232
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,440
who's trying to hurt Shancai.

233
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
Hey, you two.
When can I get my phone back?

234
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,840
It's still being repaired.

235
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,560
You don't have class this afternoon.

236
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
Why? I can't come if I don't have class?

237
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,800
Sure, you can.

238
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,080
Hey.

239
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
What were you two looking at?

240
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
You're being so secretive.

241
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,680
We were watching a romantic action movie.

242
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,720
-You won't like it.
-Romance action.

243
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
Liars.

244
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
I doubt you were watching a movie. -Show me. I want to see.
-Hey!

245
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,720
Si!

246
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,560
What do we do?

247
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,120
UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI
CHEATS ON DAOMING SI

248
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,720
Who is this guy?

249
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,360
He's just asking for directions.

250
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
I get it now.

251
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,800
They lied to me.

252
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,600
Asking for directions? Directions, my ass.

253
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,760
-Hey, Si.
-Si.

254
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,680
-Calm down. Shancai is actually--
-Get off!

255
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,920
Si.

256
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,440
-What now?
-Let's go after him.

257
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Take this to the classroom first
and then the rest.

258
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,920
Are you okay?

259
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm fine.

260
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
We're sorry.

261
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,520
Isn't she...

262
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's go.

263
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Daoming Si.

264
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,760
That foreigner wasn't asking
for directions, was he?

265
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,640
He's...

266
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,200
You two went to a hotel, didn't you?

267
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,880
No.

268
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,800
Nothing happened with him.

269
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,800
Those photos on Weibo
are a misunderstanding.

270
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,320
Then why did you lie to me?

271
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,040
I did lie about who he was,

272
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,120
but there's nothing between us.

273
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,040
I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors

274
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
and nobody believes me.

275
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,720
It's fine with me.

276
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,760
As long as...

277
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,040
As long as you still trust me. We've been sitting here for three hours.

278
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,040
How long are we going to wait?

279
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,400
I think all my blood will be sucked dry
by the mosquitoes.

280
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,960
I'll be a master mosquito killer
before the night ends.

281
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,680
Si must be outraged.

282
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
The girl who the almighty Daoming Si likes

283
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,480
has become the girl
everyone hates and criticizes.

284
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
You know what?

285
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,680
-If it happened to us--
-No way.

286
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,320
We'd never like a girl to that extent.

287
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,280
Or we should say

288
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,680
there is no girl that we can't handle.

289
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
You're right.

290
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,560
But why must three people suffer

291
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
when only one person is broken-hearted?

292
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,880
Lei is so lucky he isn't here.

293
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,960
I think we won't get through
to Si right now.

294
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
There are two options.

295
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,440
One, get him drunk and drag him home.

296
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,240
Two, knock him out and drag him home.

297
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,760
This is all the alcohol left.

298
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,120
We'll have to use force then.

299
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Hey, I'll do it.

300
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,160
-I'll do it.
-Let me. -I'll do it.
-Me...

301
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
-I'll...
-Let me.

302
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Where's Si?

303
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,680
Hey, why are you standing here?

304
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,360
-Si.
-Si.

305
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,280
-Why are you sitting here?
-Why are you sitting here?

306
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,640
Shancai. Why?

307
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,760
Why did you lie to me?

308
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,960
You want me to trust you, right?

309
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
Why did you lie then?

310
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,440
You're awake.

311
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,440
Where am I? My house.

312
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,040
How did I get here?

313
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,200
You were drunk last night.

314
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,080
I didn't know where to take you.

315
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm going then.

316
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,880
I made breakfast.

317
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
-Have some before you go.
-It's okay.

318
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,840
-I'll help you.
-Get off.

319
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,840
Daoming Si.

320
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,880
Do you really hate me that much? Can you at least tell me

321
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,240
why you hate me?

322
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,800
I don't hate you. I just don't care.

323
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,000
How am I different from Shancai?

324
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,840
We are both from an average family.

325
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
We're both plain-looking.

326
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,960
We are girls that blend
into the background.

327
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,040
Why do you like Shancai

328
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
but not even notice me?

329
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Shut up.

330
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I know.

331
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
You like girls like Shancai,

332
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,400
who look innocent and naive,

333
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,840
but jump on a guy any chance she gets.

334
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,480
If that's the case, I can do it too.

335
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,800
-Take your hands off or I'll make you.
-I won't.

336
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,840
If that's what you want,
I can be like Shancai too.

337
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,440
I can be loud and bold,
pretending to be strong.

338
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
I can do everything you want.

339
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,560
I'll become whatever you want me to be.

340
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,680
Don't compare yourself to Shancai.

341
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,160
-She's not like you.
-How?

342
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,560
Shancai would never do that. Who on earth posted those photos?

343
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,000
Why did that Thomas suddenly disappear?

344
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know.

345
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
So what are you going to do now?

346
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,560
Aren't you going to clear your name?

347
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,040
I know I didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,480
I believe that justice will prevail.

349
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,320
I believe the truth will be revealed soon.

350
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,040
Hang in there.

351
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah.

352
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,840
I don't give a damn.

353
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,800
Well?

354
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,400
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

355
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,400
If I were you,

356
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
I would feel very lonely.

357
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,560
I would probably become rebellious.

358
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,440
I don't care if everyone
believes the rumors

359
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,000
and nobody believes me.

360
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,160
It's fine with me.

361
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,120
As long as...

362
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,440
As long as you still trust me.

363
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,120
What am I doing?

364
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,160
How could I do this to her?

365
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

366
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
Hey.

367
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Doesn't she look familiar to you?

368
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,080
Isn't she the girl we met
in the alley that day?

369
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,520
-Come here.
-Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,320
Let me go!

371
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,520
Let me go! Let go!

372
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,480
Let me go!

373
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,640
Let go!

374
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,120
Let me go!

375
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,280
Miss, we meet again.

376
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,440
Stay away.

377
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
You bit me!

378
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,280
You bastards will get
what's coming for you!

379
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,880
Sorry, I'm late.

380
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,640
Do you believe me?

381
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,400
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.

382
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,320
-Mr. Liu, prepare a bath.
-Okay.

383
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,040
It hurts! Can you be more gentle?

384
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm treating your wound.
There's no need to yell.

385
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,760
People would think I'm hurting you.

386
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,480
Who told you to go to my house

387
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,000
and ask my mom where I work?

388
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,040
Who would've saved you
if I hadn't gone to the shop?

389
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,640
But you shouldn't have told them
that I'm staying at your place.

390
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,520
They may get the wrong idea.

391
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,600
I saved you.

392
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm letting you stay here.

393
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,120
But instead of thanking me,
you're complaining?

394
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,120
Thanks.

395
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,480
What? I can't hear you.

396
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,800
There's no need to yell.

397
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,200
Hey.

398
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,360
Nothing happened between you
and that foreigner, right?

399
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,920
You're an idiot.

400
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,680
I barely knew him.
Why would I do anything with him?

401
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,320
That had better be true.

402
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm so angry, I could kill him.

403
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,120
Why are you so pissed off?

404
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,440
-Are you jealous?
-Yes, I am.

405
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
I'm really jealous!

406
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,920
Because I like you.

407
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,840
You... Wait.

408
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,880
Not even for 0.5 seconds.

409
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm going to sleep.

410
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,880
Hey.

411
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
Where's the guest room?

412
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,800
The third room on the right.

413
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,560
-Okay.
-Shancai.

414
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,679
I mean it.

415
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,960
Think about it.

416
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,239
I don't believe it.

417
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,400
Daoming Si actually likes me?

418
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,199
And I didn't stop him from kissing me.

419
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
What is wrong with me?

420
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,480
Yes? Come with me.

421
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,680
She's in there.

422
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,360
What's going on?

423
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,360
The person who posted
those photos is inside.

424
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,480
See for yourself.

425
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,400
Li Zhen?

426
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,840
Shancai.

427
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,320
Why are you guys here?

428
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,480
Come in.

429
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,680
My place is a bit messy.
I hope you don't mind.

430
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,040
Have a seat.

431
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,400
It looks like someone
is still feigning innocence.

432
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,960
What do you mean?

433
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,320
I think you made a mistake.

434
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,520
Li Zhen can't be the one who set me up.

435
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,960
Li Zhen.

436
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,560
You went to high school with Shancai
and attended Mingde University too.

437
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,960
Thomas left and couldn't be reached,

438
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,920
but we did some digging.

439
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,840
The Weibo user that posted
those defamatory photos

440
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,320
was you.

441
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Spit it out.

442
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Why did you do it?

443
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,640
Why?

444
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
Well...

445
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,960
Perhaps you prefer to settle it in court.

446
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,640
I'll call the lawyer.

447
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
No.

448
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,480
Fine. I admit it.

449
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,440
I posted those photos online.

450
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,120
So you set me up with Thomas?

451
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,760
Then how did you get the photos?

452
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,800
That night,

453
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,680
Thomas invited you to dance.

454
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,280
You two were having so much fun.

455
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
I could tell he was interested in you.

456
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,480
Hi.

457
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,360
-I feel sick. I need to go.
-Hey.

458
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,640
-Can you look after my friend for me?
-All right.

459
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,200
Can you send me a photo
wherever you go later?

460
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,640
Just so I'd know she's safe.

461
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,680
All right.

462
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,560
Don't worry. I dropped your friend off
at the hotel safely.

463
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,040
The next day,

464
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,040
Thomas called me to say he likes you
and wanted to see you.

465
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,520
I saw you two looking
really friendly on campus.

466
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
But then...

467
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,840
-Daoming Si.
-I saw you and Daoming Si

468
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,400
arguing by the school entrance.

469
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,560
Who is this guy?

470
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,080
He's just asking for directions.

471
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,680
Why did he grab your shoulders?

472
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,640
I'll ask him.

473
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,120
Listen carefully.

474
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,320
She's my woman.

475
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,480
Don't touch her.

476
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
So this pretty girl
already has a boyfriend.

477
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,160
I was furious as I looked at the photo
Thomas had sent.

478
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,800
So I shared it.

479
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,640
POST TO WEIBO

480
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
I don't understand.

481
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,160
Aren't we good friends?

482
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
Why were you furious?

483
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,720
Good friends?

484
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,720
Sorry,

485
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,960
but that's too big of a burden for me.

486
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
What do you mean?

487
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,800
What "good friends"?

488
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
Did you think about me when Qinghe

489
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,240
-invited you to Sanya with F4?
-Qinghe was the one who invited me.

490
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,600
At the time, I didn't know
F4 was going to be there.

491
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,880
What about lying to me
about Jing's birthday party

492
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,680
and then embarrassing me
by not picking up my call?

493
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,000
My phone was dead at Jing's party.

494
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,760
I called you after that, didn't I?

495
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
You said you couldn't come
because you were busy.

496
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,640
I wasn't busy.

497
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,280
I couldn't get in.

498
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,840
You couldn't get in?

499
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,960
I wore an expensive dress

500
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,920
that cost three times
my monthly living expenses.

501
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
I stood at the door of Jing's house.

502
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,840
I called you many times,
I couldn't get through.

503
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,840
While you guys were having fun inside,

504
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,840
I stood out in the rain
and denied entry by the guards.

505
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,400
They wouldn't let me in
no matter what I said.

506
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,800
Did you consider how I felt?

507
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,160
-I did call you!
-Don't you get it?

508
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,040
Jing's invitation

509
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
was meant for you.

510
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,400
It was for Dong Shancai.

511
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,960
It didn't matter
that my dress cost 6,000 yuan.

512
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,640
I'm just a supporting character.

513
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,240
Your accessory.

514
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,000
Nobody pays attention to me.

515
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,760
I could attend the party

516
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,080
because I'm Shancai's friend,
not because I'm Li Zhen.

517
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,760
Why would you think that?

518
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
I'm not imagining things.

519
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,560
It's the truth.

520
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,200
That's the saddest part.

521
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,080
If you really believed that,

522
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,720
why didn't you tell me how you felt?

523
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,560
Because I have my pride too, okay?

524
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,800
You're just jealous of Shancai.

525
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,040
Yes, I admit it.

526
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
That day,

527
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,720
I realized while walking home in the rain.

528
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,840
No matter how hard I try,

529
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,720
or how much effort I put in
to please others, it won't matter.

530
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,960
I should learn from you.

531
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,320
Have a pair of innocent-looking eyes.

532
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,560
Pretend to be nice.

533
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,040
Play hard to get with guys.

534
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,280
After hurting someone,

535
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,720
just brush it off
by saying it wasn't intentional.

536
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,320
Even if that were true,

537
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,440
you shouldn't have done what you did
to defame and hurt me!

538
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,880
You made people turn on me.

539
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,000
That's because I wanted you to know

540
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,040
how it felt to be hated.

541
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,440
Get off.

542
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,400
Just like what I've had to endure.

543
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,840
Don't compare yourself to Shancai.

544
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
She's not like you.

545
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,960
Li Zhen.

546
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,240
I am so disappointed in you.

547
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,960
I can't believe
this is what you thought of me.

548
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,440
If you're unhappy with me, just tell me.

549
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,880
Why did you have to resort to that
and stab me in the back?

550
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,920
You don't deserve to be my friend.

551
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,680
Whatever. The point is,

552
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,440
I don't need a friend like you either.

553
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
I no longer care.

554
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
I'm really sad.

555
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,080
So sad that I wish I could
hit you and scold you.

556
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,560
But I have nothing to say to you.

557
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,000
Li Zhen.

558
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,400
There are many things
that are unfair in this world.

559
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,360
But that doesn't mean
you should treat yourself unfairly.
