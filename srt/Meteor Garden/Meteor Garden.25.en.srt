EPISODE 25

3
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,800
Good morning, Ms. Zhou.

4
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

5
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Why are you...

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm going to the school library
for my graduation project.

7
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
I have to go.

8
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Mr. Lu, I have a question.

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,600
Go ahead.

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Did something happen
when I got home last night?

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,320
Last night, you were carried home
by two people.

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
You looked very happy.

13
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
You were jumping and dancing.

14
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,240
I gave you a towel to wipe your face.

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
You took it and jumped up and down.

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm old. I don't get it.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,200
Were you dancing a famous dance?

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,160
All right.

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,840
All right, Mr. Lu. I've got to go.

20
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
CHANGTAI WEST COUNTRYSIDE VILLA

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
Hello?

22
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,320
Meizuo.

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
I want to ask you.

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you know what happened
to me last night?

25
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
He was the boyfriend I met
while traveling?

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
I really said that?

27
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Yes.

28
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,200
You also said

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,560
that you and Terence
fell in love at first sight.

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
-You--
-Stop.

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I said that?

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,160
And right in front of him?

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
That's so embarrassing.

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Was I crazy?

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,040
Goodness...

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
What's the matter?

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
You're worried about this?

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Actually, I think it's fine.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,560
You said you regretted it anyway.

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
You left him the next day.

41
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,040
But Caina,

42
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,080
who exactly is that Terence guy

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,880
anyway?

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I don't even know his name.

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,400
I met him while traveling in Yunan.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Since you're only her friend,

47
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,920
that means I can pursue her, right?

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,240
You didn't even ask his name.

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Does that mean you're not interested
in him anymore?

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,880
Of course.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
I was just playing around.

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Why are you smiling like that?

53
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,600
But seriously,

54
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,880
did you two brought me home
together last night?

55
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,320
When I woke up this morning...

56
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
Look.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
My face is bruised and it's swollen.

58
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,920
My whole body hurts.

59
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
What happened last night?

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
Well...

61
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
Let's drink.

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
I don't want to go home.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm not going home.

64
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,560
Listen, man.

65
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,240
I brought Caina here.

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
I should take her home.

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
Do you know where she lives?

68
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,840
She'll tell me.

69
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,280
How will she do that when she's so drunk?

70
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,040
I brought her here.

71
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,160
So?

72
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,640
Can you hold her properly?

73
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
-You let go first.
-It was you.

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
It was you.

75
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
Cut it out. Let's go.

76
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
Do you know where she lives?

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
No.

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,360
Then where are you taking her?

79
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,520
It's because

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,680
you didn't want to go home last night

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
and I couldn't hold you by myself--

82
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Stop.

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,400
Don't say anything anymore.

84
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Did I do any other stupid thing?

85
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
I promise.

86
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
I've already told you everything.

87
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
I knew it.

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,920
I shouldn't drink.

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,320
I still reeked of alcohol
when I woke up this morning.

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
My goodness.

91
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,120
You even have a Chanel perfume with you.

92
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,840
I prepared that for you, okay?

93
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,400
Then remind me next time
not to drink again.

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Actually, I was really happy
with what happened yesterday.

95
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Look.

96
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,440
Ms. Zhang, are you all right?

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm fine. I just have a bad cold.

98
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
I don't want to make you sick too.

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,520
You don't look good.

100
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,400
Go and rest. I can manage here.

101
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
How can I do that?

102
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
You have your own tasks.

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,560
And you still have class today, right?

104
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,440
It's fine. My class is at 9:00 a.m.
I can still make it.

105
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,440
But you haven't had breakfast yet.

106
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm on a diet.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,880
Just go. Take care of your health.

108
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,800
Go.

109
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Shancai.

110
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,960
You're so nice.

111
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,000
You're Si's girlfriend.

112
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,200
But you still insist
on doing these things.

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,760
Ms. Zhang, we're just the same.

114
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,280
We should help each other.

115
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,280
Go.

116
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,840
CHOOSE CONTACT: SHANCAI

117
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SHANCAI

118
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,040
POST

119
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,800
Look.

120
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,520
Class, let's begin.

121
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,560
I'm nearly done
with your thesis evaluations.

122
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,880
They don't look very good.

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,760
You've studied for one semester already.

124
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,240
Can someone summarize
what the core of this class is?

125
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Professor.

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,720
The core of sales and marketing
is exchange, of course.

127
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,840
-Yes.
-It's exchange.

128
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
Daoming Si.

129
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Very good.

130
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
Of course.

131
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,040
And Professor.

132
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,800
If you've carefully evaluated
all the thesis,

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
you'll realize that this class
has a lot of talent.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,760
All right. Let's start class.

135
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Let's begin.

136
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
It's so strange.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
He hasn't interacted
with the professor much before.

138
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,440
Since when did he become so assertive?

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,120
For the first time...

140
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,200
The big bad wolf became a sheep.

141
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,760
Love is so powerful.

142
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm so worried for Qinghe.

143
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,480
Seeing that professor's face,
I don't think there's much hope.

144
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,800
Yes, I agree.

145
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
It's entirely hopeless.

146
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,800
Chen Qinghe.

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,880
If you don't study hard,
you're wasting your own life.

148
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,000
But Shancai, you did so well earlier. You handled it with ease. You were fine.

149
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
I was so nervous.

150
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
-No, I think--
-Dong Shancai.

151
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,120
You have such an incredible
boyfriend to help you.

152
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Of course you'd be well-prepared.

153
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,520
What do you mean?

154
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,960
Look. Daoming Si and Dong Shancai
are in a relationship.

155
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
Why are you feigning innocence?

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,680
That's right.

157
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,480
We're in a relationship.

158
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,880
And it's going very well.

159
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,360
Thanks for your concern.

160
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,680
-I...
-You...

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
Let's go.

162
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,160
It's fine, Shancai. Don't mind them.

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,960
Shancai.

164
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
Are you really dating him?

165
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
I'm so furious. Shancai.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,080
Why am I so unlucky today?

167
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
Daoming Si.

168
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
What does your relationship status
post mean?

169
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
Which one?

170
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,360
The one that says we're in a relationship.

171
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,800
Is there a problem?

172
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,760
Isn't that a fact?

173
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,360
I guess so.

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,040
Since it's a fact, why do you mind?

175
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,840
It's not something
worth telling everyone about.

176
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
Why not?

177
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,200
I have a girlfriend.

178
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,320
I liked her for a long time.

179
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,160
Now she finally said yes.

180
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,320
The most important thing is
nobody can steal her from me.

181
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,160
And now I'm feeling happy every day.

182
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm improving a lot.

183
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,560
Earlier, our professor
even complimented me.

184
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
The professor who had a 60 percent
chance of failing you?

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
How's that possible?

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
How's that impossible?

187
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,960
As long as I'm happy,
everything is possible.

188
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,000
-You're the stupid one.
-No, you're the stupid one.

189
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
I passed my exam earlier, okay?

190
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,680
That's all because of me.

191
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Have you forgotten
who sacrificed sleeping at night

192
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,000
-and helped you study?
-Never mind. Let's just go.

193
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Let's go. Yes.

194
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Thank you.

195
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
But didn't I also help you
with social anthropology

196
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,920
and sales and marketing?

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,120
I wanted to thank you for it.

198
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,480
But you came and blamed me
about posting our relationship status.

199
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,400
Sorry.

200
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,600
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

201
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,680
Then what do you want?

202
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,200
Go on a date with me.

203
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,240
Why are you laughing?
Do you want to come along?

204
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,840
Daoming Si.

205
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,040
Where do you want to go
after you graduate?

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,040
I thought you didn't care.

207
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,440
After I graduate,

208
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,280
I'll go back to London, I guess.

209
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
Back to London?

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
For a vacation?

211
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Of course not.

212
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,960
I'll help with my family's business.

213
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,720
Then are you still coming back?

214
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,440
If I don't, would you be sad?

215
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,200
Of course.

216
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
Won't it be hard to see you then?

217
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,880
Why don't you

218
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
beg me?

219
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,720
Beg me and I'd consider staying
in Shanghai for you.

220
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Really?

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,040
You'll stay if I beg you?

222
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,000
Will you beg me or not?

223
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Will you die if you do that?

224
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
Of course I won't die.

225
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,640
But just stay if you want to stay.

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,960
Why do I need to beg you?

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
You silly girl.

228
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,400
Why are you so stupid?

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
You want me to say everything. You're stupid.

230
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
What do you want me to stay?

231
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,800
You should say,

232
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,040
"Can you not go to London?

233
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,640
Can you go to graduate school
and wait for me to graduate?

234
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
Can you stay with me forever
after I graduate?"

235
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,680
Couldn't you say that?

236
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,200
Really?

237
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,720
You're going to graduate school here

238
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,760
so you can graduate with me?

239
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,160
Daoming Si.

240
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,080
What?

241
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,440
I'm so happy!

242
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
Seeing you smile so cheerfully,

243
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm so happy too!

244
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,760
How silly.

245
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,280
Why are you here?

246
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm waiting for you.

247
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,640
For me?

248
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,880
You're free, right?

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
I'm not.

250
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,480
I have a date with Meizuo.

251
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
A date?

252
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,080
Then why are you coming home?

253
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,440
I left earlier.

254
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,480
Then I realized I forgot something.

255
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
So I came back.

256
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
And I'm leaving now.

257
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm not the police.

258
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm not interrogating you.

259
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
Why give such a detailed explanation?

260
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,200
I...

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,240
I want to tell you something.

262
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm in a hurry. Maybe next time.

263
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
Meizuo's waiting for me.

264
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,360
I'll drive you.

265
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,840
But...

266
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,320
Weren't you in a hurry?

267
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,000
And I know Meizuo too.

268
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,560
-Hello?
-Hello? Meizuo.

269
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Where are you?

270
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,880
At my friend's house.

271
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,920
Can you come over now?

272
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,160
I need you.

273
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
Okay. Right away.

274
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,000
Guys, I need to go somewhere.

275
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,839
We just arrived.

276
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,160
What's the matter?

277
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
It's an emergency.

278
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,520
Have some fruit.

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
Shancai's still living here?

280
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,640
Where else should she live?

281
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,160
I mean, she can handle your mom
and stay here.

282
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,800
She's so brave.

283
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,720
It's true.

284
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,480
I shiver every time I hear his mom's name.

285
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
Is his mom that scary?

286
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Oh please.

287
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,720
Because of her,
many of her business rivals

288
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,080
went bankrupt and homeless.

289
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,520
If she dislikes someone,
she'll ruthlessly eliminate him.

290
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Stop it.

291
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,480
You even called her an "old hag."

292
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
I...

293
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,360
Did I say that?

294
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
Why don't I remember that? We all heard it.

295
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,600
Don't think you could bully me
just because I'm young,

296
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,600
you old hag!

297
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,480
What did you say?

298
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,640
Say it again.

299
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
Old hag!

300
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,440
Yes, I'm calling you that.

301
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,600
You're not welcome in my world.

302
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,400
Get out.

303
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,000
I said leave!

304
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,760
When she comes home

305
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,040
and discovers that person
is living in her house

306
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,360
and dating her son,

307
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
can you guess

308
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
what she'd do?

309
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,480
Si, what's your plan?

310
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,800
She's my mom. What can I do?

311
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,320
But if she threatens Shancai,

312
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,880
I'll stand in front of her
and protect her.

313
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,720
My mom just comes home a few times a year.

314
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm sure I'll think of something
before she comes back.

315
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,680
Meizuo.

316
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,240
What took you so long?

317
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,680
-Do you miss me that much?
-Listen to me.

318
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,400
When we walk to the bar there,
we have to pretend to be very sweet.

319
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,280
Then you have to say that we have a date,
but you're late.

320
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,240
All right?

321
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Who should I say that to?

322
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,120
To that guy you met before.

323
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,120
Him again.

324
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,080
Why?

325
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
Don't ask.

326
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,440
Hurry. I'll tell you later.

327
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
Sorry.

328
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm late.

329
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,600
That's fine.

330
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
You're even late on dates.

331
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,160
What a good boyfriend.

332
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,840
Why do you say that?

333
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,360
I respect girls.

334
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm never late.

335
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,400
Then why was today an exception?

336
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
Because...

337
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,600
Because of me.

338
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,840
He's never late.

339
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
But because he's younger than me,
I don't mind even if he's late.

340
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,040
Right?

341
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,920
What do you mean?

342
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
All right. Never mind.

343
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
Since we're here to drink,

344
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,520
let's order, okay?

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
You can't drink. Don't drink anymore.

346
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,960
Then I'll order soda.

347
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,040
You guys can drink.

348
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,400
Okay?

349
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,840
I want something strong.

350
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,840
Can you drink?

351
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,960
You should ask if I've ever gotten drunk.

352
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
What matters is your behavior
after drinking,

353
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,680
not the amount you can drink.

354
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,720
What an immature thing to say.

355
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,400
It's basic etiquette for a man
to behave after drinking.

356
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,800
Why is it even worth mentioning?

357
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
Fine. Since you can drink a lot
and behave very well,

358
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
it's my treat tonight.

359
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,160
No problem.

360
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,440
Wei Xun.

361
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
Hey.

362
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,160
Please give this gentleman a red dynamite.

363
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,240
All right. Sir.

364
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
Why are you here on my date with Caina?

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm here to talk to Caina.

366
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Can't you see that we're on a date?

367
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,080
Very well.

368
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,880
I'll say just it in front of him
rather than behind his back.

369
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,560
Makes sense. Go ahead.

370
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't want to talk about that.

371
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,080
Let's talk another time.

372
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,200
Why?

373
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,360
Why not today?

374
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Because I don't want
to talk about that now.

375
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,560
-What is it?
-What is it?

376
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
You know what I'm talking about.

377
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,040
Yes, that's the one.

378
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,360
So I don't want to
talk about that. Please.

379
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,760
Your red dynamite.

380
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Bottoms up.

381
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,480
Red dynamite has all kinds of liquors
mixed with chili powder.

382
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,280
It'll knock you down afterwards.

383
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,280
Meizuo, did you make a mistake?

384
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,760
This is a cocktail for women.

385
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,600
Let's give it to Caina.

386
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,040
-Sure.
-No, you can't drink that.

387
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,040
Why?

388
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,160
I can handle cocktails.

389
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,640
This guy is so cunning.

390
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,840
You want to prank me? No way. You won't get drunk
even if you drink this all night.

391
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
Really?

392
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,280
-Then let's order another one.
-That's right.

393
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
You missed the first one.

394
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
Another red dynamite.

395
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
All right.

396
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,960
Caina ordered this for you. It should work this time.

397
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
Drink it. Very good.

398
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
Do you like it?

399
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,920
Yes.

400
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,760
That's great.

401
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,520
You both like it.

402
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,120
Darn boy. It's so hot.

403
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,600
I've decided.

404
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
It's my treat tonight.

405
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,080
Wei Xun. Two red dynamites for them.

406
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,920
-All right.
-I'll die if I have another one.

407
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
Here.

408
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Your red dynamite.

409
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
Drink it.

410
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,920
Why aren't you drinking it?

411
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,720
Why not?

412
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,600
Yes.

413
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,040
Come on, Meizuo. Cheers.

414
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
Wait.

415
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,160
What were we talking about earlier?

416
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,760
We were talking about what Caina
doesn't want to talk about.

417
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
I remember now.

418
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,680
You're wondering why Caina was fine
the day before,

419
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,480
but she left the next day, right?

420
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,600
Yes.

421
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,720
What are you doing?

422
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,320
I don't want to talk about it.

423
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Can't you guys just drink?

424
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
Drink.

425
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
I know!

426
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,840
Isn't it obvious?

427
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Caina doesn't like you.

428
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
She regretted what happened.

429
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
So she left the next day. Isn't that normal?

430
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,960
Is that so?

431
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,600
Isn't that so?

432
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Caina, is that so?

433
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,520
You were just playing around with me?

434
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,000
-I'll drink it if you don't.
-Hey, Caina.

435
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,000
Caina.

436
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,000
Caina.

437
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,320
Caina.

438
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,120
Caina.

439
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Hey, Caina.

440
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,480
Caina.

441
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Caina.

442
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
I don't want to go home.

443
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,080
What are you doing? Let go.

444
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,640
You let go.

445
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,680
Caina's my girlfriend. Stay away.

446
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,640
-Caina.
-What are you doing?

447
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,360
-What are you doing?
-What do you want?

448
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
-Are you all right, Caina?
-Caina.

449
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,280
Come on. Get up.

450
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,840
My head's spinning.

451
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,560
It hurts.

452
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,200
Didn't we agree to go buy reference books?

453
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,440
But...

454
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,400
I want to go home and organize
my old clothes.

455
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Your clothes?

456
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,280
I want to sell them as secondhand items
at an online store.

457
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,160
I'll earn money
and the clothes won't go to waste.

458
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
It saves space and can help those
who need it.

459
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
That's multiple wins. I'm smart, right?

460
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,800
You're really thoughtful.

461
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,760
I also need to go and clean your house.

462
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
That's what you're worried about?

463
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,840
-I'll just call Mrs. Yu.
-Don't.

464
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
I'm a cleaner at your house.

465
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,480
I don't want to have special privileges.

466
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,920
All right. I'll go by myself.
Text me the books you want.

467
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,920
I'll send you the book list later.

468
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,800
DEAL COMPLETED

469
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
I sold them in two hours.

470
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,360
This secondhand online store is great!

471
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,760
What's going on?

472
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,000
Mrs. Daoming is coming.

473
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,680
Why is she suddenly coming back?

474
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
I have to leave now.

475
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,680
Welcome home, ma'am.

476
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,200
Nothing happened when I was away, right?

477
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
No, ma'am.

478
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Everything's all right.

479
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Did you prepare my bath?

480
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,240
Yes.

481
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,720
Who allowed you to use your phones
while working?

482
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,640
It wasn't me. ma'am. Then who was it?

483
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
Stop hiding. Come out.

484
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,040
Aren't you Dong Shancai,
who refused the five million yuan?

485
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,880
Why are you a maid at my house?

486
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,920
Mrs. Yu.

487
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,880
Can you explain it to me?

488
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,880
I was the one who hired Shancai.

489
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,200
Based on my observation,

490
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,240
she works really hard
and doesn't slack off.

491
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
She does her tasks well.

492
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,880
I hope she can stay here.

493
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,240
I won't ever allow
this kind of inferior girl in my house.

494
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,480
This kind of girl doesn't use tricks

495
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,200
but relies on her hard work to survive.

496
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,520
What's wrong with that?

497
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
Mrs. Yu.

498
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,640
Don't argue with her because of me.

499
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll leave.

500
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,600
You're working in the Daoming household.

501
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,880
You're under my authority.

502
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
You can't leave.

503
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,280
Ma'am.

504
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,560
Ever since she came here,

505
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
Si studies very hard

506
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,040
and his temper has been tamed.

507
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,160
Shancai is a good influence on Si.

508
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,920
Si is improving because of her.

509
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,600
So,

510
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,040
can't you make considerations
for Si's sake?

511
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,320
If you let Shancai take care of Si

512
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,440
and Si changes for the better,

513
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,840
isn't that also good for you?

514
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Mrs. Yu.

515
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,640
I respect you because you've stayed
in this household for 60 years.

516
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,720
However,

517
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,440
it doesn't mean you can do
whatever you want.

518
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,320
I won't allow this girl to date my son.

519
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,520
I brought Zhuang and Si up

520
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,760
all by myself.

521
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,560
I saw how you destroyed
Zhuang's happiness.

522
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,600
I made a vow

523
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,760
to never let Si experience the same pain.

524
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,480
I won't let Shancai

525
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,920
leave this house.

526
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,160
Why are you interfering with this?

527
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,840
Let me remind you.

528
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm the master of this house,

529
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,200
not you.

530
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,960
Mrs. Daoming.

531
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
Have you forgotten

532
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,360
Si's grandpa's last wish?

533
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,680
Then let me remind you.

534
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,120
He said

535
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,480
that as long as I live,

536
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
I'll take charge

537
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,640
of this household.

538
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,560
What if I insist on sending her away?

539
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,080
Then,

540
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,280
please...

541
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
do it over my dead body.

542
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,080
When will you stop crying?

543
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,960
It's so annoying.

544
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,400
Looking at you cry

545
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,280
makes me feel like I'm dying.

546
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
I feel so sad.

547
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,679
I'm so mad and embarrassed.

548
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
Plus--

549
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,760
All right.

550
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,280
Drink this hot tea.

551
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,320
Don't think about anything anymore.

552
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,480
Thank you, Mrs. Yu.

553
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,600
You protected me

554
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
and you defended me.

555
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm not sure how I can repay you.

556
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,680
No, don't.

557
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,080
Don't do anything.

558
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,520
Don't cause any trouble.

559
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,760
I had a hard time saving you
from the lion's den.

560
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,880
Just stay here.

561
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,160
Understand?

562
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,000
Sorry.

563
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,240
I used to think

564
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,120
that you're a harsh

565
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
and unreasonable old lady.

566
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,960
I am.

567
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,800
Look at your ugly face.

568
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Stop staring at me.

569
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,280
I won't look at you then.

570
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,560
By the way, Mrs. Yu.

571
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,640
How did you end up
at the Daoming household?

572
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,480
It's a long story.

573
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,320
When I was

574
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,080
19 years old,

575
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,720
I was living alone

576
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,280
and I needed to pay off debts.

577
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,560
I was in a difficult situation.

578
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,200
Si's grandpa knew about my situation.

579
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,360
So he paid off my debts.

580
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,640
And let me work in the Daoming household.

581
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,000
My life

582
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,800
was saved by Si's grandpa.

583
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,160
So I've decided

584
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,560
to take care of the Daoming family
my whole life.

585
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,200
I'll use my life to repay them.

586
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,520
Later,

587
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,200
Mr. Daoming,

588
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,840
Si's dad,

589
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,040
slowly grew up

590
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,520
and graduated.

591
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,720
Mrs. Daoming married into the family.

592
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,240
Then Zhuang and Si were born.

593
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,600
This family was happy for decades.

594
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,880
What kind of person is Daoming Si's dad?

595
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,240
Mr. Daoming

596
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,920
was really nice. He's very smart since he was little.

597
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,280
At a young age,

598
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,840
he handled the Daoming family's business.

599
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,160
And he didn't disappoint.

600
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,880
He works very hard

601
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,960
all day and all night.

602
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,560
I often told him
to take care of his health.

603
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,680
Don't wear himself out.

604
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,560
But he said, "I can't.

605
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,920
The company's employees
are depending on me.

606
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,280
How can I be lazy?"

607
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,120
He's really an outstanding person.

608
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,240
Indeed.

609
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,240
But I

610
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,720
would have wanted him to slack off a bit

611
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,200
and worry less.

612
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,880
I think I've heard Daoming Si mention

613
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,680
that his dad already passed away.

614
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,720
When Si was in high school,

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
he got liver cancer

616
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,960
and passed away.

617
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,200
What happened afterward?

618
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,200
After Mr. Daoming passed away,

619
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,080
Mrs. Daoming handled the Daoming Group.

620
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,720
This family

621
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,000
changed as a result.

622
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,560
They weren't happy anymore.

623
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,120
It slowly became cold.

624
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Zhuang

625
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,880
really grew up

626
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,080
to be a kind girl indeed.

627
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,240
But Si's temper

628
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,680
cannot be controlled by anyone.

629
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,840
When Si was in high school,

630
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,000
he'd always come home with wounds.

631
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,240
We only found out
when the school notified us

632
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,560
that he'd been getting into fights.

633
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,040
Mrs. Daoming was worried,

634
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,920
but because she was busy with work,

635
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,920
she didn't have much time.

636
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,160
So she hired a tutor to discipline him.

637
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Si, you're home.

638
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,760
-Your face--
-You're so annoying!

639
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,800
But it was useless.

640
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,480
More incidents kept on happening.

641
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,080
I was worried and sad
about what was happening.

642
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,440
I really didn't know what to do.

643
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,840
I've always been worried about Si.

644
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,480
After you came here,

645
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,720
I realized

646
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,840
that Si has changed.

647
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,960
Did he?

648
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,000
I didn't do anything.

649
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,840
I only...

650
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,720
Initially, I really hated him.

651
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,160
Whenever I don't agree with his ways,

652
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,960
I would beat him up.

653
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,480
Like this.

654
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,400
That's what I did.

655
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,760
That's right.

656
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,960
After Zhuang got married,

657
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,160
nobody here would dare to do that to him.

658
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
No.

659
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,040
The first time when I beat him up,
I also risked my life to do it.

660
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,040
It's scary when I think about it now.

661
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,400
If you ask me to beat him up now,
I wouldn't dare.

662
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,920
Shancai.

663
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,160
You can't leave this house.

664
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,080
I, Mrs. Yu,

665
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,920
would risk my life to protect you.

666
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,520
How's that possible?

667
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,400
Don't worry.

668
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,360
I've got a great plan.

669
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,440
A plan?

670
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,240
Mrs. Yu, I think it's quite late.

671
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,640
-I'll go ahead.
-You can't go.

672
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,080
If you dare to leave,

673
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,640
the next time you see me
would be at my funeral.

674
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,480
Mrs. Yu.

675
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,120
How can you threaten me that way?

676
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,200
All right. Tell me your plan.

677
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,200
My plan

678
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,560
is called...

679
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,720
the act first, report later, undercover,
secret, shotgun wedding plan.

680
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,560
Do you understand?

681
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,280
You spoke too fast.

682
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,880
I didn't hear you clearly. Subtitle translation by Coleen Chua
