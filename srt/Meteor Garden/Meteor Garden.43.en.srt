EPISODE 43

3
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,160
Something happened to Daoming Si.
Watch the live broadcast on Now.

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,440
At around 11 a.m. yesterday,

5
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Daoming Si, the successor
of Daoming Group,

6
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,920
was stabbed by an unknown person.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,520
It was reported that Daoming Si
fell into a coma.

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,880
He's still undergoing emergency treatment
and is in critical condition.

9
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Don't worry.

10
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Shancai called to say she's fine.

11
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
The perpetrator
who was arrested at the scene

12
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,440
was a former employee
of the Daoming Group.

13
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,560
His motive is yet unknown
and the investigation is still pending.

14
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
Lei.

15
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,280
He was covered in blood.

16
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,520
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

17
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,600
Am I too greedy?

18
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
That's why the heavens are punishing us.

19
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,320
This is not a punishment. It's a test.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,960
People who can surpass this test
can obtain happiness.

21
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,360
The patient's stab wound is too deep.
He lost a lot of blood.

22
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,360
The brain suffered local contusion
due to severe impact.

23
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Why did this happen? Who exactly hurt Si?

24
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
We have already arrested two suspects.

25
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
And they already confessed

26
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,520
that they were former employees
of the Daoming Group's hotel chain.

27
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,200
The hotel closed down due to
poor management and they lost their jobs.

28
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,360
So they wanted revenge.

29
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,280
Also, Ms. He Yuanzi also confessed

30
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
that the kidnapping on the island
was a prank of hers.

31
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Aren't you aware of that?

32
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Ms. Xiaozi invited us for a party
on their island.

33
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,200
We just found out about the prank
after we arrived.

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,720
But our phones didn't have any signal,
so we couldn't contact the police.

35
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,560
Okay. Please come to the station
to record your statement.

36
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
The three of us will go with you first.

37
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
Please give Shancai more time...

38
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,440
-for her statement.
-All right.

39
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
You can come with us first.

40
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
Doctor.

41
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,040
-How is Daoming Si?
-The surgery was a success.

42
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,000
The patient is out of danger.

43
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,200
However, his skull
suffered a severe impact,

44
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,560
which may result to clogging
of blood vessels or compressed nerves.

45
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,320
We still have to determine
whether it would have any after-effect.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
You can visit him in his room later.

47
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,800
-Thank you, Doctor.
-You're welcome.

48
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Shancai.

49
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
I just finished recording my statement
at the police station.

50
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,760
I brought some food and clothes for you.

51
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Sorry.

52
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,600
If it wasn't because of me,

53
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,920
Si wouldn't have been stabbed.

54
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,200
It's not your fault.

55
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
You don't need to feel guilty.

56
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,160
I caused so much trouble.

57
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,680
Actually,

58
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,960
I can't even look you two in the eye.

59
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,040
I know you did it so Daoming Si
and I can be together.

60
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,120
Stay and wait with me

61
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
until he wakes up.

62
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,720
With you around,
I'll feel brave and more confident.

63
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,720
Really?

64
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
Yes.

65
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Shancai.

66
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,400
You're so kind.

67
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Mrs. Daoming, Daoming Si is--

68
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,680
The doctor will tell me how he's doing.

69
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Shancai.

70
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
It must have been hard for you.

71
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,720
It's a good thing he's safe.

72
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Thank God Daoming Si is all right.

73
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,920
Xitian.

74
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
When's the next flight back to London?

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,520
There's a direct flight at 10 p.m.

76
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,120
Mrs. Daoming.

77
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Aren't you staying at a time like this?

78
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
Si is already safe.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Stay and take care of him.

80
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
When will you stop dragging everyone
into this game you're playing?

81
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
-I--
-Mrs. Daoming.

82
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,880
If you handled the employee
matters properly,

83
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,480
Si wouldn't have been stabbed.

84
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
It's not Shancai's fault.

85
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
Xiaozi.

86
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,280
I think you seriously misunderstood me.

87
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,240
I'm working with your dad

88
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,280
to push things in the right direction.

89
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,080
I'm quite fond of you. Don't abuse it.

90
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,280
And don't play childish games
with this girl anymore.

91
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,920
But Mrs. Daoming, I--

92
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,920
Shancai.

93
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
You once told me

94
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
that I'm not welcome in your world
and I should leave.

95
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Now, I'm also telling you

96
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,600
that you're not welcome
in the Daoming family's world.

97
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,240
Please don't show yourself
in front of Si anymore.

98
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,240
You can shut me out of your world,

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
but Daoming Si has to be part of mine.

100
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,720
Whatever happens,

101
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,520
I'll stay here

102
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,760
until Daoming Si wakes up.

103
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,760
If he wants me out of his world,

104
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,680
I want to hear him say it himself.

105
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,200
You will soon enough.

106
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,040
How's Si?

107
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,720
He's not awake yet.

108
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,720
Come and wait inside.

109
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,440
Daoming Si.

110
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,040
You're finally awake.

111
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
Where am I?

112
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,960
Why am I here?

113
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Si, you were seriously hurt
and you were in a coma for a few days.

114
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
I was hurt?

115
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
Yes. Who is she?

116
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Si, are you not fully awake yet

117
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,240
or did you lose your memory,
like what the doctor mentioned?

118
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,840
Hey, do you know who I am?

119
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Ximen.

120
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,040
-How about me?
-Meizuo.

121
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,080
How about him?

122
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,480
Lei. Why are you even asking me that?

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,120
Then who am I?

124
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Monkey. Ugly Monster.

125
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Stop it.

126
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,960
You scared me.
I thought you've lost your memory.

127
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,320
Then who is she?

128
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,200
What is she doing here?

129
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
Si, cut it out.

130
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,880
How can you remember all of us
but not Shancai?

131
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,720
Shancai?

132
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
What a lousy name.

133
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,080
It'll be all right.

134
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,240
He just woke up.
His brain is still a mess.

135
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
That's right.

136
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,320
They love each other so much.
I don't believe he's forgotten her.

137
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Shancai.

138
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,360
How about you tell him what happened
between you two?

139
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,760
-Maybe it'll help him remember.
-Yes.

140
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,120
Green shoes.

141
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,240
Do you still remember

142
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,600
that you stepped on my phone and broke it?

143
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,360
I went to the opening ceremony

144
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,880
and your fans pushed me around.

145
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,800
So I dropped my phone
and it broke when you stepped on it.

146
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
I even confronted you about it.

147
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you still remember?

148
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,920
Hey, green shoe guy.

149
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,640
-What's this?
-A broken phone.

150
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,640
You broke it by stepping on it.

151
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
Hey.

152
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,880
And a lot of other things happened.

153
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,599
I watched the meteor shower with you
on your balcony.

154
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,359
You gave me a meteor necklace.

155
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,319
This gift has a special meaning.

156
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,400
So you can't refuse it.

157
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Why are you so overbearing?

158
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
Because you're the only one
I'm willing to trade all the meteors

159
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,680
in the sky for.

160
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,800
And look at your phone.

161
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,680
In the Fantasy Westward Journey game,

162
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,560
-you gave me a Meteor Garden.
-All right. Stop.

163
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't understand what you're saying.

164
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,400
Please don't forget me, okay?
You have to remember me.

165
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,320
Why do I have to remember you?

166
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,560
Because she's the one you love the most.

167
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,160
And because she also loves you the most.

168
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,800
The one who loves me the most...

169
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,280
Right?

170
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,760
Remove the word "right."

171
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,520
Yes.

172
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm the one who loves you the most.

173
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,080
I'm telling you.

174
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,800
I am.

175
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
In London,

176
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
we promised each other

177
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
to also live happily in our next lives.

178
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
I've decided...

179
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,840
not to wait for our next life.

180
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
In this life,

181
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,880
I would always love you.

182
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
I will.

183
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
I definitely will.

184
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
It doesn't matter if you lost your memory.

185
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,480
I'll make you love me again.
I love you so much, do you know that?

186
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
Shancai.

187
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,280
Don't be that fierce.

188
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,720
Si's still recovering.

189
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
I don't care if you're still recovering.

190
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,160
I want to tell you that I, Dong Shancai,
will be with you no matter what.

191
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,400
You said that yourself.

192
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,360
If you lie, then you're a dog.

193
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
I knew you were lying.

194
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,680
How else can I listen
to her love confession?

195
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,520
I really admire my own intelligence.

196
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,040
You can even joke around
at a time like this.

197
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,360
You've gone too far.

198
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,320
This is great.

199
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,120
Everything's back to normal.

200
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
I don't mind if you hit him.

201
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Shancai.

202
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,600
Go ahead.

203
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,400
Hey, Mrs. Yu. Whose side are you on?

204
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
By the way, Lei. Thanks.

205
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,280
Good thing you pushed the perpetrator
away at the right time.

206
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,560
I don't think a thank you is enough.

207
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,080
Who else would block that knife for you?

208
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,240
Why? Wouldn't you do it too?

209
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,240
-We'll think about it.
-We'll think about it.

210
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,160
You two.

211
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,400
Go home and reflect on yourselves.

212
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,840
Among my three friends,

213
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,000
at least one has a conscience.

214
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
It's true love between Lei and me.

215
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,960
Idiot.

216
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
You're holding your true love
in your hand.

217
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,280
Hey.

218
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,880
Let go of me.

219
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,760
Let go. Let go now.

220
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
-I'll hit you.
-No.

221
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,800
Let go.

222
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,560
Mrs. Yu, Si seems to be fine.

223
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,240
You must be tired too. Go home and rest.

224
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,560
By the way, don't tell Mrs. Daoming
that Si has woken up.

225
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,240
I won't.

226
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,400
I'll only tell Zhuang.
So that she won't worry.

227
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
I'll go now.

228
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Are you still mad?

229
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
Think of it this way.

230
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,320
Your love confession brought back
my memories.

231
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,920
You should be happy.

232
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
It really shocked you, right?

233
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,080
Yes.

234
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,680
I was really shocked

235
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
the moment I saw you get hurt.

236
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
When you were rushed
into the operating room,

237
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,880
I was so worried
and flustered the whole time.

238
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,120
Staring at the red light
of the operating room

239
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
was such torture.

240
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,360
Initially,

241
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,200
I just prayed that you'd wake up.

242
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,440
But I never thought

243
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,200
you'd forget me after you did.

244
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,680
When you looked at me like a stranger,

245
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,480
I was so flustered.

246
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,760
For a moment, I even thought

247
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
that maybe I tortured you too much

248
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,960
so the heavens

249
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,520
let you only forget about me.

250
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,880
I forgot the fact

251
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,200
that having you alive and well

252
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
is the most important thing.

253
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,760
You fool.

254
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,880
How can I forget about you?

255
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,960
We're like Velcro.

256
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,440
We can't be separated no matter what.

257
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
It's so great that Si's out of danger.

258
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,680
After going through grief and tests,

259
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,880
you'd know if what you have is true love.

260
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,840
It makes you quite envious, right?

261
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I don't agree with your view on love.

262
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,600
If it were me,

263
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,920
I definitely wouldn't want
to go through such a test.

264
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,640
Maybe Meizuo's right.

265
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,320
Only true love can surpass the tests

266
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,480
and achieve real happiness.

267
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,040
Only people who've experienced it knows.

268
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,080
When did I experience it?

269
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,480
He's talking about you and Jing.

270
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,840
You two didn't pass your test.

271
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,520
So your love is like porcelain.

272
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,800
It broke with a touch.

273
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,320
What are you talking about?

274
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,320
The relationship between Jing and I

275
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,680
already turned into something
more intimate than love.

276
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,560
What is it then?

277
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,760
Loving each other forever
but not possessing each other.

278
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,360
Always remembering the best
about each other.

279
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,960
That is such a high level of love.

280
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,160
I salute you but I can't do it.

281
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,200
I'm also really envious.

282
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Me too.

283
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,120
Mom, Dad. You're home.

284
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
We missed you.

285
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,360
Your mom saw the news
at the fishing village.

286
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
She was really worried.

287
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,040
Mom, I'm fine.

288
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,160
My poor daughter.

289
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,360
You stayed at the hospital
the past few days.

290
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,120
You didn't sleep well, right?

291
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
Yes. I'm so tired.

292
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,280
Of course you are.

293
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,600
Your dad and I are worried about you
so we came to visit.

294
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,520
How's Daoming Si?

295
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,320
He's fine now. Don't worry.

296
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
He's young. It's good that he's fine.

297
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,800
Should your mom and I
go visit him at the hospital?

298
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
There's no need.

299
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,560
You might meet his mom there.
Isn't that more uncomfortable?

300
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
All right. You get some sleep.

301
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
Okay.

302
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
Your dad and I will leave
in a couple of days.

303
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
It's winter vacation soon.

304
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Do you want to spend
Chinese New Year with us there?

305
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,280
Of course.

306
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,480
We have to spend
Chinese New Year together.

307
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,840
Good. Go to bed.

308
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,760
Okay.

309
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
How is she?

310
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
She's already asleep.

311
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,040
She must be exhausted after what happened.

312
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,080
I just realized something.

313
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,560
Even though Daoming Si
is a very nice young man,

314
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,240
the gap between our families is too wide.

315
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,880
What happened this time is a warning.

316
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,920
They're still young anyway.

317
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,480
Later on, I'll try to convince Shancai...

318
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,920
and Daoming Si

319
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,160
to just be ordinary friends.

320
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,680
-She's here.
-Hurry.

321
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,000
-Dong Shancai.
-Hurry.

322
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,520
You're the girl who risked her life

323
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,800
and protected the successor
of the Daoming Group, right?

324
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,360
What's your relationship with Daoming Si?
Are you lovers?

325
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,320
Did you just risk your life
to do what's right?

326
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,840
-Tell us.
-Say something.

327
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,960
-Say something, okay?
-What's your relationship?

328
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
-Explain it.
-Can you respond?

329
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,160
-Say something.
-Please respond. What's your relationship?

330
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
-Are you lovers?
-Miss?

331
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,640
What exactly is your relationship?

332
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
Yes. What's your relationship? -Please respond.
-Yes. Please respond.

333
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,800
Can you tell us?

334
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Don't go.

335
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
-Tell us. Don't go.
-Don't run away.

336
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,200
Please respond.

337
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,360
Don't run away. Please respond.

338
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
-Tell us.
-Miss.

339
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,960
What exactly is your relationship?

340
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,840
Stay back. Back away.

341
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,880
Back away.

342
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,160
-Tell us. Don't go.
-Don't go.

343
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,280
-Please respond.
-Don't go.

344
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,280
-Don't run away. Let us interview you.
-Tell us.

345
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,480
Miss.

346
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,280
Shancai, you're so cool.

347
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,920
Weak and fragile girls are not in anymore.

348
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,240
What's in now is your type.

349
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,920
Why are you speaking that way?
Why are you making that expression?

350
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Qinghe.

351
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,240
Are you Shancai's manager?

352
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,280
He's just a jealous little frog.

353
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
What?

354
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,320
Shancai.

355
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,760
You're my goddess from now on.
Love you. See you later. Bye.

356
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,360
They like Shancai now.

357
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,480
Shancai, are you all right?

358
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,800
Qinghe, Xiaoyou, and I
are so worried about you.

359
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,520
We originally wanted to visit
Daoming Si at the hospital.

360
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,480
But we called Ximen
and he asked us not to go.

361
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,520
I'm fine. Thanks.

362
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,440
Shancai is my idol forever.

363
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,040
How could you be so brave?

364
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,840
Weren't you afraid of the other
perpetrators that could be hiding?

365
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,680
How could I care about that?

366
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,200
There was only one thing on my mind
when I saw him collapse.

367
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,120
I have to help him get up.
I have to save him.

368
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,880
If it were me,

369
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,640
-you would've done the same, right?
-Chen Qinghe.

370
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,480
-You're really the King of Jealousy.
-You...

371
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
Hey.

372
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,080
Qinghe's my best friend.
Of course I'd save him.

373
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,520
It's enough to hear that.

374
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm willing to be
your best friend forever.

375
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,720
I, Chen Qinghe, hereby wish Shancai
and Daoming Si happiness forever.

376
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,560
I officially withdraw from pursuing you.

377
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,520
Unless...

378
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,040
you abandon Daoming Si.

379
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,560
Or unless Daoming Si abandons you.

380
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
And unless

381
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,640
-their birth details are not compatible--
-That's enough.

382
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,760
No.

383
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,040
I haven't said everything yet.

384
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,280
Don't worry. I'm fine.
You don't need to come.

385
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,480
All right. Tell me.

386
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
What's your sister's name?

387
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,520
Are you an idiot?

388
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,960
You're calling me an idiot?

389
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,600
I mean only an idiot wouldn't know
your name is Daoming Zhuang.

390
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,360
The world's most beautiful
and talented sister.

391
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,520
All right. You seem fine.

392
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
That's right.

393
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,280
But you really scared me.

394
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,000
I was already so mad when you got hurt
all over from fighting before

395
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
because you didn't take
good care of yourself.

396
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,360
I know.

397
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
It won't happen again.

398
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,520
But it's not your fault this time.

399
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,120
I'm mad at Mom.

400
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,239
Actually, it's not all her fault.

401
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,239
She's to blame for everything
related to the Daoming Group.

402
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,639
All right.

403
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm fine now.

404
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,159
I'm telling you.

405
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,080
Somebody said that my ability to recover
is like that of a dog.

406
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,679
A dog?

407
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,520
I know. Shancai must have said that.

408
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,560
All right. I'll go ahead. Bye.

409
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,880
I'll go and see you some time.

410
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,560
Mrs. Yu.

411
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,320
Where are you going?

412
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,560
Mrs. Yu.

413
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,640
My wound...

414
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
is recovering.

415
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
I want to get discharged.

416
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,360
Discharged?

417
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,200
Yes.

418
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,720
I've been here for two weeks.

419
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,840
If I stay here longer,

420
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm worried that my wound
might get infected.

421
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,440
Also,

422
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,280
I'll stay at Lei's house
for the time being.

423
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,080
I don't want to face my mom.

424
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,600
Your mom won't be back anytime soon.

425
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,080
She's busy with the London headquarters.

426
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,280
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

427
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Can you be discharged?

428
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,520
I have the ability to recover
as fast as a dog anyway.

429
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,840
You look like you have something to say.
What is it?

430
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,640
I want to marry Shancai.

431
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,600
I'm fine with it.

432
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,640
Shancai's not fine with it.

433
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,040
Shancai's worried about your mom, right?

434
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,840
Actually, I've already thought about it.

435
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,640
I can make it on my own.
Why do I need to rely on my mom?

436
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,280
Don't forget.

437
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,000
When I was 18,
I made my first million in stock trading.

438
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,200
The point is that Shancai doesn't want you
and your mom to fight because of her.

439
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,480
You really know Shancai well.

440
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,240
Don't tell me you're jealous?

441
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,360
Not this time.

442
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,120
Actually, I already have a plan.

443
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,840
I'll marry Shancai first,

444
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,960
then I'll tell my mom the secret plan
I've long prepared.

445
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,640
And turn the Daoming Group
into a hotel group with a new concept.

446
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
What's your secret plan?

447
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,520
The secret plan is a secret, of course.

448
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,120
How can I tell you about it?

449
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,640
Good night.

450
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,920
-Your two Peach Red Royales.
-Thank you.

451
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,080
-Please come again.
-Bye.

452
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,840
Shancai, you're alone today?
Thanks for your hard work.

453
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm fine, ma'am.

454
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,640
Why is Xiaoyou on leave today?

455
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,360
Did something happen? -Xiaoyou?
-Yes.

456
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,160
Oh, she said she's going
to a Way of Tea club.

457
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,680
And she'll help us come up
with new products.

458
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,720
How nice. She's so concerned
about the shop.

459
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
Of course.

460
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,720
Her dream is to open a franchise
of Talent's Tea Shop.

461
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,040
That's great.
She never mentioned that to me.

462
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
I have to ask her about it later on.

463
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,440
You two started working so hard here

464
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
since you graduated senior high school.

465
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm so lucky to have you two.

466
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,040
We're also lucky to have
such a good employer who takes care of us.

467
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,520
Hi, everyone. My name is Jiang Xiaoyou.

468
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm glad to join this Way of Tea club.

469
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,040
I hope I'll learn a lot from you.

470
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,920
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

471
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,440
You're so cute.

472
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,560
Yifen, the girls in our group
all have long hair, except you.

473
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,840
Now, Xiaoyou's here.

474
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,720
That's great or else they'll say
I look like a guy.

475
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,280
How come?

476
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,920
Your eyes are so big.
You look like a short-haired doll.

477
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,320
Speaking of dolls,
Yifen knows how to make them.

478
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
They're really cute.

479
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,120
Sometimes, our club has activities.

480
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,720
She sells her dolls with our tea leaves.

481
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,320
-They're really popular.
-Yes.

482
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,880
Really?

483
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,400
I really want to see how it looks.

484
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,560
Just ask her to make you one.

485
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,520
That's right.

486
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Can you make me one?

487
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,120
Sure, but...

488
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,920
find me a boyfriend.

489
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,480
Stop pretending.

490
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,760
Every time someone pursues you,
you just ignore them.

491
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,120
-That's right.
-That's right.

492
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
I have to feel a spark.

493
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,000
What's your type then?

494
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,960
She likes men who know the Way of Tea.

495
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,920
But the guys who do are usually ugly.

496
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,840
That's right.

497
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,160
Why are you calling us ugly?
We're very unique, okay?

498
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,880
Xiaoyou, what's your type?

499
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,280
Like you, I also like men
who know the Way of Tea.

500
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,000
We have hope.

501
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,960
Xiaoyou, don't mind them.

502
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,800
Do they know the Way of Tea?

503
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,360
-They just know nonsense.
-You...

504
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,400
Yifen.

505
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
You're really...

506
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,280
You're so cute. I want
to take a picture with you.

507
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,840
All right.

508
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,480
Look. Short-haired girls are so cute.

509
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,680
Yes. That's right.

510
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,440
What? Isn't long hair nice too? Long-haired girls are very elegant, okay?

511
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,280
-That's right.
-Fine.

512
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,200
-All right.
-Elegant.

513
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,080
Good thing Daoming Si's fine now.
He recovered so fast.

514
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,600
-How lucky.
-Yes.

515
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,360
I was so worried then.

516
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
I thought he'd die.

517
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
Or lose his memory or something.

518
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,440
I was so worried at the hospital.

519
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,680
When I saw you on the news broadcast,
I was so shocked.

520
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,960
I still remember your expression then.

521
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,400
I really idolize you.

522
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,800
I'm such a coward compared to you.

523
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,200
What?

524
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,160
That was all adrenaline.

525
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,960
I didn't know what I was doing.

526
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,400
Should I buy something
to celebrate Daoming Si being discharged?

527
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
Flowers or something nutritious?

528
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,760
There's no need. Just be there.

529
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,520
What's important is that
we're all together.

530
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,840
But I'm not sure what to say

531
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,720
if I see Ximen.

532
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,200
Just treat him as Daoming Si's friend.

533
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,280
You haven't seen him for a while, right?

534
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,760
When you were in London,
I met him to ask about you.

535
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,960
He was quite cold to me.

536
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,520
Xiaoyou.

537
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,320
Stop obsessing over these things.

538
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,280
Maybe Ximen's not suitable for you.

539
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,320
Stop worrying about him.

540
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,280
Okay.
