A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 11

3
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
Tian Ye.

4
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,160
This is Yang Rong.

5
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
She graduated from cooking school
with the best grades.

6
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,840
She'll help you in the kitchen.

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,880
I remember you told me
that she would be here before noon.

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,560
It's already one o'clock.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,160
Sorry, I'm late. I was stuck in traffic.

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,840
If you can't be here on time,

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
I won't work with you.

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,760
But, Tian Ye,

13
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,640
I spent a lot of effort poaching her.

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,040
If you kick her out,
who's going to take the job?

15
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm sorry. I'll never be late again.

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
Please give me another chance.

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
What's your name?

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
I'm Dong Shancai.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
You're here to try out for the job, right?

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,160
Can you start today?

21
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,400
-No problem.
-No.

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
I just read her resume.
She has no experience.

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Attitude is more important.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Si.

25
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,240
Mom called me.

26
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,720
She wants me to bring you
back to London this time.

27
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
I have already refused for you.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
Zhuang, I've decided.

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,920
Decided what? I'm going to the UK.

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,080
Didn't you say you'd never go?

31
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, I changed my mind.

32
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,320
I made up my mind
before the Bridge competition.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
When the competition is over,

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,120
regardless of the outcome,
I'm leaving for the UK.

35
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
I'll take a look at the schools there.

36
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
If I like it there,

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
I'm going to study there.

38
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
Is this because of Shancai?

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,560
Zhuang, I don't have to explain.

40
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,200
I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.

41
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,840
The faster, the better.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,440
By the way,

43
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,160
can you help me with the application
and my passport?

44
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,440
You're this easily defeated?

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,280
That's not the Daoming family spirit.

46
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,560
I can finally rest.

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm getting old now,

48
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
I can't deal with this.

49
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
-Thank you, Mr. Gao.
-Thanks.

50
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm going to retire soon.

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
You young people should work hard.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
Tian Ye.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
You're going to take over
as the head chef soon.

54
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
I don't know if I'll pass the exam.

55
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,360
Hey, try the pork ribs I just made.

56
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
That smells amazing. You can cook?

57
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,400
My mom has a takeout restaurant.

58
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
So, I learned a bit from her.

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
It's pretty delicious.

60
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,840
It looks good too.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,560
Which school did you go to?

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
I go to Mingde.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,120
-Mingde?
-Mingde?

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,280
Only elite students go there.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,640
Why did you come to help in the kitchen?

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,520
I major in nutrition
and my mom cooks for a living,

67
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,680
so I'm happy when I'm in the kitchen.

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,800
I can learn so much here.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,320
We sure have a lot of elite students here.

70
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,160
This is our sous chef,

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Tian Ye.

72
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,600
He's also an elite student
in business school.

73
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,720
You guys should go ahead and eat,
I'm still cutting onions.

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,840
I'll come over later.

75
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,520
Daoming Si is gone.

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,920
Will F4 break up?

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
-My heart has left with Daoming Si.
-What?

78
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Hey, Shancai.

79
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,680
Shancai!

80
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,120
-What?
-Have you heard?

81
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,840
-Heard what?
-Daoming Si is going to London.

82
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,280
London? You're going to London?

83
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
It's not a big deal.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
My mom's business is there.

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
It's totally normal for me to go there.

86
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,360
Liar.

87
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
You hate it in London.

88
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
Are you trying to avoid Lei and Shancai?

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Why would I avoid them?

90
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
Si. Just so you know,

91
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,840
I'm not going to London
because of you. It's my plan.

92
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm going to come back a better man.

93
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,080
Yeah right. You won't last two months.

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
You're going to London?

95
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
Yes. Got a problem with that?

96
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,120
Shancai, he's not sure yet.

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
Talk some sense into him.

98
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,080
I've made up my mind.
No one can persuade me.

99
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm leaving tomorrow.

100
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,880
Tomorrow?

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,200
Why didn't you tell me?

102
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,040
Why would I tell you?

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,320
Without me in the way,
you can finally date him.

104
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,360
Isn't that right, Lei?

105
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,760
You should get right to it.

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,120
When I get to London,
I'll find a blond girl

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,640
and we'll go on dates
by the River Thames every day.

108
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
It will be so romantic.

109
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
Fine. Go then.

110
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm happy you're leaving.
I'll live happier without you.

111
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
Goodbye forever!

112
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Shancai, bring over the soup.

113
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,640
Okay.

114
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
Be careful!

115
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
Are you okay?

116
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,880
I'm fine.

117
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
Hello, sir.

118
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,840
-Daoming Si?
-Where's Shancai?

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,960
She has the night shift today.

120
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,600
She's probably at Frankie's Restaurant.

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
Frankie's Restaurant?

122
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Thank you.

123
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,960
You've been distracted all day.
What's wrong?

124
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,680
I...

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,760
Shancai, there's a boy here for you.

126
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,360
-For me?
-Yeah, he ordered a lot and won't eat.

127
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,560
He said the food isn't fresh.

128
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,360
He demands to see someone in the kitchen.

129
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,160
He's just here to cause trouble.

130
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm here for Dong Shancai.

131
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,880
Have her come out.

132
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,280
Sir, excuse me.

133
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Dong Shancai works in the kitchen,
she can't come out here.

134
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,640
If she doesn't come out, I won't leave.

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
What are you doing here?

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
Sir, you said that our food isn't fresh.

137
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,520
Which dish was it?

138
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,240
That's not the point.

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,400
I'm here for her.

140
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,360
Restaurants are for eating.

141
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
If you're here to see her,

142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,120
please wait until she's off work.

143
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,960
You're getting in the way of our work.

144
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,480
By the way,

145
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,240
our restaurant has always
been known for our fresh food.

146
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,320
-Please don't hurt our--
-That's enough.

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,720
I didn't come here to listen to you.

148
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm here for Shancai.

149
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Aren't you going to London?

150
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
What happened to your arm?

151
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
It's just a small burn.

152
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,080
It's none of your business.

153
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
Can't you learn how
to take care of yourself?

154
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,120
You're taking on too much work.

155
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Why didn't you tell me?

156
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,480
Why should I tell you?

157
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,040
Is it any of your business?

158
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
Let's go. Hey!

159
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,520
You can't just do whatever you want.

160
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
You're so immature.

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,120
Sir, please have some respect.

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
She's my employee.

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
Giving her problems
is causing us problems.

164
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,080
Who the hell are you?

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,560
You have no right to talk to me.

166
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
Daoming Si.

167
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,000
I work here.

168
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,840
Please respect my job and my colleagues.

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,360
What do you mean?

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,320
I mean...

171
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,680
Please leave.

172
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,280
I was going to say goodbye before I left.

173
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
Looks like there's no need.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,200
Daoming Si.

175
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
Dong Shancai.

176
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm never coming back.

177
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,800
Goodbye.

178
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Are you okay?

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,320
I'm fine.

180
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,120
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,080
I thought he was just a picky customer.

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,480
That Daoming Si...

183
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,280
Is he your boyfriend?

184
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,600
No.

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,800
He's none of my concern.

186
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,120
I didn't say goodbye properly
to Daoming Si.

187
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,880
Maybe in the future, I'll regret it.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
But perhaps it's better for us this way.

189
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,560
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

190
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,120
Didn't you break up with Daoming Si?

191
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,760
Why are you still mad?

192
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,720
I don't know.

193
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,960
I don't have the right to be mad at him.

194
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,040
But when I heard he was going to London,

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,240
it was just too sudden.

196
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,880
I can't accept that
he's leaving so quickly.

197
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,840
You care about Daoming Si.

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,280
That's impossible!

199
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,600
His actions are unbearable.

200
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
I know.

201
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
He went to see you

202
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,440
because he wanted to get back together.

203
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,880
But, you guys argued again.

204
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,320
Shancai, you're home.

205
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,720
You're home, sweetheart.

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,160
Why do you look so sad?

207
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,640
What are you up to lately?
You've been coming home late.

208
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,600
I found a new part-time job.

209
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Part-time job?

210
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,760
What is it?

211
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,920
Is it hard work?

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,960
-Will it affect your studies?
-No.

213
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,440
It won't affect my studies.
It will help me learn some skills.

214
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,680
Really?

215
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Yes, I'm helping in a restaurant kitchen.

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,560
I've arranged my schedule.

217
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't worry.

218
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,920
Working in a kitchen? There's fire in the kitchen.

219
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,960
Should we be worried about you?

220
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,040
Our daughter has perfect skin,

221
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,080
what if she gets burnt?

222
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,800
Don't worry.

223
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,280
Mom, don't I cook with you all the time?

224
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,680
Fine.

225
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
I guess with better cooking skills,
you'll be able to cook for us.

226
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,760
Sounds good.

227
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,640
Shancai will be able to take
our restaurant to the next level, right?

228
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,640
Take these clothes inside.

229
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,400
She's working now,
don't make her do chores.

230
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,000
She still has to do her chores.

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,920
You shouldn't spoil her.

232
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,800
A, C, W,

233
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,680
X,

234
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,160
D,

235
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,160
D,

236
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
B, D...

237
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,920
You got three out of ten.

238
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,320
What?

239
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
If that's true,

240
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
how am I supposed
to get your super memory?

241
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,240
You wanted me to train you.

242
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,600
Have you lost hope now?

243
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
Why do you want a super memory?

244
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,480
I'm a part of F4.

245
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,520
I have to work hard to improve myself.

246
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,280
I can't ruin our reputation.

247
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Didn't you quit?

248
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,160
Now you've joined F4 again?

249
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,280
I...

250
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,920
Hey.

251
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,960
Daoming Si, tell them, am I a part of F4?

252
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Si, what's wrong?

253
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,160
You look mad.

254
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,680
I guess it's because someone isn't here.

255
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
We should have invited Shancai.

256
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
She can't come.

257
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,280
She's working right now. It's tough work. I really admire Shancai's energy.

258
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,480
I would work with her,
but I have too many classes this semester.

259
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,040
Why would you bother Shancai
when she's working?

260
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,200
None of your business.

261
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,120
None of my business?

262
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Everything about Shancai is my business.

263
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,880
Why is it your business then?
Aren't you going to London?

264
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,720
Qinghe, you have the F4 spirit.

265
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,520
Since Si is going to London,

266
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,760
I guess you can join F4 now.

267
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,119
-I have already joined.
-Shut up!

268
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,560
Hey, Xinhui,

269
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,680
did you know that Daoming Si
is leaving tomorrow?

270
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,079
Isn't his flight today?

271
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
I wonder if the plane has taken off?

272
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,040
Shancai.

273
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,960
You're not sending him off?

274
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Of course not.

275
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,960
I thought you like him.

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,880
Who likes him?

277
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,080
You keep saying that you like Huaze Lei,

278
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
but the truth is, you like Daoming Si.

279
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
Why can't you admit it?

280
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,760
That's nonsense.

281
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,120
Who knows when he'll be back?

282
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
Are you really giving up on him?

283
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,080
Did you know?

284
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,680
When we were fighting,

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
Si got drunk one time.

286
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
I took him to my place.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,320
I thought he would like me.

288
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
But he told me,

289
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,400
I was different from you.

290
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,040
He said that Shancai
wouldn't betray her own heart.

291
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,120
So do you want him to leave?

292
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,880
Si.

293
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
Don't miss us too much in London.

294
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,560
I emailed you our pictures.

295
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,200
You can look at them when you miss me.

296
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Who wants to see your face?
I'm not a woman.

297
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
You guys are like little girls.

298
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,720
He won't be gone forever.

299
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,720
Zhuang, we don't care about Si,

300
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
-but we'll miss you.
-Hey.

301
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,560
With you gone,
nobody will yell at us or kick us.

302
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
-We'll feel so lonely.
-Really?

303
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll miss you too.

304
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,800
Give me a hug.

305
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,840
Okay.

306
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,360
I want one too.

307
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
You're such a good boy.

308
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
So? You don't want a hug?

309
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Silly kid.

310
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,760
Have you said goodbye to Shancai?

311
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Whatever.

312
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,240
Why should I say goodbye
to that ugly thing?

313
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,040
I'm an elegant, beautiful,
graceful and gentle woman.

314
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
How can you be so rude to me?

315
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,360
You're elegant?

316
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
That hurts!

317
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Little brat.

318
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,480
Have I not hurt you enough?

319
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,960
Huaze Lei will take care of Shancai.

320
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
Isn't that great?

321
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
Okay, Si and I need to board now.

322
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Goodbye now.

323
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
Take care, Zhuang. -Don't miss me.
-Bye.

324
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,600
-Bye.
-Safe flight.

325
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,880
Si, wait.

326
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,400
I have something to tell you.

327
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,600
What?

328
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,000
-What are they talking about?
-I don't know.

329
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,720
Welcome, passengers.

330
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,840
-Thank you for flying with us.
-Please fasten your seat belt.

331
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,800
-We're about to take off.
-Seat belt.

332
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Please fasten your seat belts

333
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,160
and switch your phones to airplane mode.

334
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

335
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,120
Have a delightful flight.

336
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,600
Lei...

337
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,520
That son of a bitch.

338
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,720
What did you say?

339
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,160
Hey! I need to get off.

340
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,360
Stop it.

341
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm warning you. Sit down.

342
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,360
Don't embarrass me.

343
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,800
-I don't care. I need to get off.
-Sit down!

344
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,600
-I don't care.
-Sit!

345
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,840
-I'm getting off!
-Sit!

346
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Brat.

347
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,040
You're an arrogant,
green shoe-wearing, pineapple head.

348
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,520
You think you're popular at school

349
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,440
so you can do whatever you want.

350
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,520
You're just a jerk.

351
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Give it back.

352
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Hey. Give it to me!

353
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,320
Hey!

354
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
Give it to me!

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,760
What do you want?

356
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Here, it's your coat.

357
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,920
Sorry.

358
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,520
I'm late.

359
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,360
If you say you didn't do it,

360
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,880
I believe you.

361
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,000
Why do I suddenly feel disappointed?

362
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,640
I thought you like Daoming Si.

363
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
No. I don't like him.

364
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,800
I don't like arrogant and pushy people.

365
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,840
I just...

366
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,960
What's wrong with me?

367
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,560
Zhuang and Si are here.

368
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,120
Where's Mom?

369
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,400
She's working in New York.

370
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,840
Where's Yuanzi?

371
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,000
She went to New York with Mrs. Daoming.

372
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,920
Oh.

373
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,120
Zhuang, since Mom's not here.

374
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
I have no reason to be in London.

375
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
We should go back to Shanghai now.

376
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,880
What?

377
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
You said you wanted to study here.

378
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,320
Then, you made a scene on the plane.

379
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Now, you want to go back?

380
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,080
What the hell is wrong with you?

381
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,960
Do you want to get beaten up?

382
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
Hey.

383
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
You were the mean one.

384
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,480
You made me pass out on the plane.
Are you even my real sister?

385
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,920
I told you, I was a gift
from the phone company.

386
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
But for real,

387
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,800
I've enrolled you in a lot of...

388
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,400
a lot of international finance classes.

389
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,200
You better stay in London.

390
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
Or what will I tell Mom?

391
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,520
What will you tell Mom?

392
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,160
Did mom send you to control me?

393
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,880
Stupid boy.

394
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,480
You don't understand anything.

395
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
If it weren't for me,

396
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,880
Mom would've flown to Shanghai
and kicked your butt.

397
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,520
Mom is too busy.

398
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,880
She doesn't have time for me.

399
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
That's true. But, remember,

400
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,520
Mom wants you to take over Daoming Group.

401
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,480
She can't be here with you,

402
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
but whatever you say or do

403
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,280
is totally under her control.

404
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,280
You know that, don't you?

405
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Of course I do.

406
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
But...

407
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,280
so what if she disagrees?

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,120
I won't let her control my life.

409
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,800
He's all grown up now.

410
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,520
Nothing happened between Shancai and I...

411
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,680
that night.

412
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,680
I think the person
Shancai really likes is you.

413
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
LOG IN

414
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,920
FRIENDS

415
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,120
FRIEND: I WON'T TELL YOU

416
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,320
What's your name?

417
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,400
I won't tell you.

418
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,840
Why can't you tell me?

419
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
What's your name?

420
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,480
I told you.

421
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,920
I won't tell you.

422
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,640
Hello? Hello?

423
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,560
Is this Frankie's Restaurant in Shanghai?

424
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,960
I'm looking for Dong Shancai.
She works in your kitchen.

425
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay.

426
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,600
-You are?
-I...

427
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm her dad.

428
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,120
There's an urgent family matter.

429
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,040
Hurry up.

430
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Hello, Dad? Why aren't you talking?

431
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Is his phone reception bad?

432
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
Dad, if you don't talk, I'm hanging up.

433
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,920
Hello?

434
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,760
It's me.

435
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,640
How's work? Is it tough?

436
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,040
Do you have enough money?
I hope they're not bullying you.

437
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,560
Sorry, you have the wrong number.

438
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,960
That dumb woman.

439
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,960
She hung up on me!

440
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
But...

441
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,240
It's not her fault.

442
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,040
She didn't know it was me.

443
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,280
FENG SHUI INN

444
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,440
Si!

445
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,320
You're back in London!

446
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,320
Yes.

447
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,840
I'm here to have some food.

448
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,160
We're not open now. No food for you.

449
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,440
Yue, you can cook for me.

450
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,000
Pretty please?

451
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,800
-Please, Yue?
-Okay.

452
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,440
-I'll set it up for you.
-Okay.

453
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,200
Si.

454
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,720
Si,

455
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,840
I haven't seen you
since you started college.

456
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
It's been four years, right?

457
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
Yes.

458
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,400
I've been longing for your cooking.

459
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,880
It's my favorite since childhood.

460
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,880
Please enjoy.

461
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,160
These are all your favorite dishes.

462
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,440
Kung Pao chicken, braised eggplant,

463
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,320
and sweet and sour pork ribs.

464
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,320
Dandan noodles, too.

465
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm starting to drool now.

466
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,760
You've grown up so much.

467
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,120
When your mom first brought you to London,

468
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,800
you were only six.

469
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,000
You didn't have money
and you were in front of our restaurant

470
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,600
trembling with hunger.

471
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,320
What a poor sight.

472
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,920
But, you were so cute.

473
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,880
Good thing I met you, Yue.

474
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,080
After you had my cooking,

475
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,640
you refused to go home.

476
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Your parents were so worried.

477
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,400
They looked all over London.

478
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,880
The police almost brought me in.

479
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,520
I couldn't help myself.

480
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,520
My parents were always busy
and took me all around the world.

481
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,520
It was so irritating.

482
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,640
By the way,

483
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,280
my mom never cooked for me.

484
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm glad you like my food.

485
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,960
You're always welcome here.

486
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
Thank you, Yue. You're the best.

487
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,360
Honestly,

488
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,400
you're a lot like my son-in-law.

489
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,280
You look mean and immature, but actually,

490
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,080
you're very nice, kind and adorable.

491
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
He must be handsome.

492
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,280
Of course.

493
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,160
Then...

494
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,240
who's more handsome?

495
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,800
Me or him?

496
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,040
You are

497
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,640
pretty much the same.

498
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,520
-I'll prepare dessert.
-Okay.

499
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,000
You don't know how hard
other people have to work.

500
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,640
-You're a parasite of society.
-Shut up!

501
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Look familiar?

502
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,000
This sweet and sour pork rib
doesn't look good at all.

503
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,360
If you don't want it, throw it away.

504
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,680
Why do I always think of her
when I have sweet and sour pork ribs?

505
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,240
TIAN YE IS TAKING OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS

506
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,640
Shancai, can you taste this for me?

507
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,280
Of course.

508
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,800
It's lobster.

509
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,080
It looks amazing.

510
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,000
What do you think?

511
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,280
It's very good.

512
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,679
Hey,

513
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,400
what's this called?

514
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,679
You've been working on it for five hours.
It must be very complicated.

515
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,960
Yes.

516
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,760
It's a famous French dish
called Lobster Thermidor.

517
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,239
Only a few chefs know how to make it.

518
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,120
Qian is one of them.

519
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,520
Who's Qian?

520
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,480
Qian is the best chef in China.

521
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
Every year, he inspects
the restaurants in Shanghai.

522
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,000
I've worked here the past year
to receive his approval

523
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
and become the head chef.

524
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,960
That's wonderful.

525
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,639
The sauce must be hard to make.

526
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,679
Exactly.

527
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
This fish soup

528
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,719
has abalone, sea cucumber,
shark tail skin, yak-skin gelatin,

529
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,440
king oyster mushrooms, pork tendon,
and many other ingredients.

530
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,640
It takes three hours to make.

531
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,240
I found this formula
after trying for three months.

532
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,000
Just the sauce takes that long?

533
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,560
To be honest, there is a shortcut.

534
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,040
There's a special ingredient
called Kamio leaf.

535
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,120
It can replace the sauce.

536
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,760
Then you can just use that.

537
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,040
Why trouble yourself?

538
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
It still tastes different.

539
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,160
Chefs like us shouldn't be lazy.

540
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,960
Kamio leaves are incredibly rare, too.

541
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,040
Is that so?

542
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,000
When are you taking the exam?

543
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,480
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

544
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
I was kind of nervous,

545
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,560
but you said it's good, which helped me.

546
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,200
Tian Ye, you work very hard.

547
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
I'm sure you'll be the best chef ever.

548
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,840
All the best tomorrow.

549
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,120
No way.

550
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
-What should he do?
-I don't know.

551
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,120
What should he do?

552
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,280
He's doomed.

553
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,600
What's wrong?

554
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,040
What happened?

555
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,360
Tian Ye is doomed.

556
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,840
He fell asleep this morning
and the fish soup cooked for too long.

557
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,200
The flavor is all wrong.

558
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,680
There's only two hours left
until his exam.

559
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,280
He's trying to make the soup again,
but there's not enough time.

560
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

561
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,160
Tian Ye.

562
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm so stupid.

563
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,440
I spent the whole year here
just for this day.

564
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Don't freak out.

565
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,960
We'll find a way.

566
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,080
I need three hours to make the soup.

567
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,880
It's impossible.

568
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,960
Can you postpone it to tomorrow?

569
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
There's no tomorrow!

570
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,160
There's a special ingredient
called Kamio leaf.

571
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,560
It can replace the sauce.

572
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,560
Tian Ye, make the Lobster Thermidor.

573
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,840
I'll go get Kamio leaves for you.

574
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,800
This... Shen Nong Village?

575
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,680
PLACES TO BUY KAMIO LEAVES

576
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
ONLY AT SHEN NONG VILLAGE

577
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,360
SHEN NONG VILLAGE HERBS

578
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,520
Hello, I need Kamio leaves.
How many do you have?

579
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,160
How do you know we have them?

580
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,520
I looked it up online.
This is the only place in Shanghai.

581
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,640
You're lucky. We have one left.

582
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,560
-How much is it?
-1,500 yuan.

583
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,280
That expensive?

584
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,440
Tian Ye, I got the Kamio leaves.

585
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,560
SHEN NONG VILLAGE HERBS

586
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,840
Dong Shancai, where are you?
There's only 30 minutes left.

587
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,960
Wait for me. I'm almost there.

588
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
The Kamio leaves...

589
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,640
The Kamio leaves...

590
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,120
What should I do?

591
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,600
Young lady,

592
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,120
are you okay?

593
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
Do you remember me?

594
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
-Out of the way!
-Hey!

595
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,000
Watch out!

596
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,480
Tian Ye, is there still time?

597
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,960
What happened, Dong Shancai?

598
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,880
I'm fine. Go cook.

599
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
There's no time left.

600
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,480
Tian Ye, very good job.

601
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
You're still young,
but this lobster is marvelous.

602
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,320
You have great potential.

603
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,520
Qian, you're too kind.

604
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,400
But,

605
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,320
if this sauce

606
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,000
wasn't made from Kamio leaves,

607
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,840
it would taste even better.

608
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,240
Tian Ye, where did you learn how to cook?

609
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,120
I haven't received professional training.

610
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,320
I've loved to cook since middle school. So, I did part-time jobs in restaurants.

611
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,560
That's how I gained experience.

612
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,720
Tian Ye did a lot of part-time jobs,
just like me.

613
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,640
Tian Ye.

614
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,040
-I guess his life
-Good job.

615
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,520
-is just as difficult as mine.
-Your future is very bright.

616
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,160
Take care.

617
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,520
Congratulations, Tian Ye.

618
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,800
From now on, you're the head chef
of Frankie's Restaurant.

619
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,240
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

620
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,160
If it weren't for your Kamio leaves,

621
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,760
I wouldn't be able to pass the exam.

622
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,920
This is all because of you.

623
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,280
Shancai, thank you.

624
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,600
You're welcome.

625
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,760
I'm happy that they saw
how talented you are.

626
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,480
"I'm happy that they saw
how talented you are."

627
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,560
Congratulations, Tian Ye.

628
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,720
Congratulations.

629
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,760
Head chef.

630
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,280
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

631
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,080
-Head chef.
-Congratulations.

632
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,240
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

633
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,400
-Head chef!
-Head chef!

634
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,080
-Head chef!
-Head chef!
