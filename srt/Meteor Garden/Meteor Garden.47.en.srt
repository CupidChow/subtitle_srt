00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 47

3
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,320
I can't believe what I saw last night.
What era are we in now?

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
How could this happen?

5
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Si's mom...

6
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,920
Is she crazy?

7
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,480
Maybe his mom has gone crazy.

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,800
Crazy with what? Money?

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
The Daoming family has loads of it.

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Do they really need
to merge the companies now?

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
What if it is very urgent?

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
Why?

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,040
Why is it so urgent?

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,640
Maybe Daoming Group is doomed.

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,360
Lei, why do you say that?

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,080
The employee who stabbed Si

17
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,520
said that he was treated poorly
by the Daoming Group hotel.

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
That's why he took revenge on Si.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Maybe all the hotels are doing poorly.

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
If that's the case,

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
then they have a huge problem.

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,120
Can we do anything to help?

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,080
The most urgent thing now

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,440
is to keep Si from doing anything
he'll regret because of this.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
How do we do that? Find Shancai.

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
Shancai, have you eaten?

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
You don't have to comfort me.

28
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
Just tell me.

29
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
How is Si doing right now?

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Tell me.

31
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm prepared.

32
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,160
Didn't you come to tell me the bad news?

33
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,680
I can tell from your eyes.

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
Shancai.

35
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,800
According to Mrs. Daoming's plans,

36
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,000
Xiaozi and Si are going
to get married soon.

37
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Shancai.

38
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
You know that this isn't what I want.

39
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Then...

40
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,840
What do you want me to say?

41
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Congratulations?

42
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,080
Xiaozi.

43
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,200
I can't say that.

44
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,680
I know.

45
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,800
I know you won't believe anything I say.

46
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
But Shancai,

47
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
can I ask you a favor?

48
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Please, let go of Si.

49
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
Xiaozi...

50
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,640
We all know that this wedding
is going to happen.

51
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
When Si found out,

52
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,280
he didn't eat or drink.

53
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
I see what's happening to him.

54
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,720
He's getting worse and worse.

55
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,600
We all tried to talk sense into him.
We all did.

56
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
But he wouldn't listen to us.

57
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,240
If this continues,

58
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,040
he will die.

59
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,400
Please.

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I beg you. Just...

61
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Just talk to him

62
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,640
and tell him to stop hurting himself.

63
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,280
He'll listen to you.

64
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,360
But his mom would never let me see him.

65
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
If you're willing to give up,

66
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
his mom will let you see him.

67
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Lei.

68
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Even you're trying
to make me give up on him?

69
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,360
No. We know Si too well.

70
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,240
Once he makes a decision,
he'll do anything to make it happen.

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,040
If you don't go,
he'll fight with his mother to the end.

72
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,040
Maybe his willpower can beat his mom,

73
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,080
but his body can't.

74
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,840
Shancai, please forgive us
for being selfish.

75
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,240
We want you to see him

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
not to get your boyfriend back,

77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,920
but to save him from dying.

78
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Shancai,

79
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,840
do you know

80
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,880
that you're the only person
who can save Si?

81
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Because...

82
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,440
he doesn't listen to any of us.
He only listens to you.

83
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,120
I know this is unfair to you, but...

84
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,960
I'm begging you.

85
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
Xiaozi.

86
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,720
Promise me one thing.

87
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,120
When you and Si get married,

88
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,600
don't invite me to the wedding.

89
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,000
Because...

90
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
I've already given him to you.

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's go, Xiaozi.

92
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,880
If you're there,

93
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,080
his mom will let me see him.

94
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
I'm not alone.

95
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,960
I have everyone's support
and encouragement.

96
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm not fighting alone.

97
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,160
Xiaozi.

98
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,160
You're about to become
a part of our family.

99
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,720
So you have to follow our family rules.

100
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,160
In the future,
don't make friends with lowly people.

101
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,800
It'll affect your image.

102
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,800
Do you understand?

103
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
Straighten your back. Stand firmly. I won't be defeated by those cold eyes.

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm here to see Si.

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Where is he? Please let me see him.

106
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,640
Mrs. Daoming,

107
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,560
I brought Shancai here
so that she can talk some sense into Si.

108
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,760
No need.

109
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,320
Mrs. Daoming, please consider it.

110
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,760
Maybe Shancai could talk to him
and he would start eating.

111
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,520
This might be our last resort.
Why can't we try it?

112
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,360
I can't let her seduce my son again.

113
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,280
Shancai has given up on him.

114
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
She said so herself.
She'll make it clear to Si.

115
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,840
Mrs. Daoming, please let them meet.

116
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
I won't let them meet.

117
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,880
Fine. That's okay.
Let them talk through the door.

118
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,840
Mrs. Daoming, think about it.

119
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm marrying Si next week.

120
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,760
Unless I'm sure that they've cut it off,

121
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
I'll worry about marrying him.

122
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,200
Please let me talk to him.
I'll leave after that.

123
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,760
You go with her.

124
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,120
They can only talk through the door.

125
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,080
After she's done, send her out.

126
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Thank you, ma'am.

127
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,720
Let's go.

128
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
What is it?

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,760
I want to see him on my own.

130
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
Can I?

131
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,360
I'll only talk through the door.

132
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't worry. Sure.

133
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Daoming Si.

134
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,960
Daoming Si.

135
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
It's Shancai.

136
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,920
Shancai?

137
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,720
Can you hear me?

138
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,680
Shancai.

139
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,240
You idiot.

140
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,160
Why aren't you eating?

141
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,760
Why are you doing something so stupid?

142
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Is it because of me?

143
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,800
You always say I'm an idiot,

144
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,400
but you're the idiot.

145
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Maybe...

146
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,960
You should just listen to your mom

147
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
and marry Xiaozi.

148
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
That would be nice

149
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
because Xiaozi really likes you.

150
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,160
But...

151
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,440
I never really liked you.

152
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,360
I'm an ordinary girl.

153
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,080
I wanted to marry you

154
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
just for the fame and money.

155
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,040
For the glamour.

156
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,640
Did you hear that?

157
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,400
I did.

158
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,680
Go on.

159
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,760
When we first started dating,

160
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
it was pretty fun. But towards the end,

161
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
it started getting complicated.

162
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,400
I couldn't take it anymore.

163
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,560
If only we had never started dating.

164
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
That would make things easier, right?

165
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,360
I thought about it for a long time.

166
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,600
And I want to tell you that

167
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,520
ever since the beginning,

168
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,920
I never really liked you.

169
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,880
Daoming Si,

170
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,839
do you know how ridiculous you were?

171
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
Dong Shancai.

172
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,240
You're... so cute.

173
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,040
How can you

174
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,600
be so stupid and cute?

175
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,840
I'm really...

176
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,960
happy.

177
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,520
What's this nonsense?

178
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,040
Do you even know

179
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
what's going on right now?

180
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,280
Shut up.

181
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
Use your stupid little head

182
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,960
and try to think about

183
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,160
everything I've ever said to you.

184
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,880
Si... Calm down

185
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,440
and think about it.

186
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,560
Think about those
bad times we went through.

187
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
And how my love never wavered.

188
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,760
I haven't forgotten.

189
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
I believe

190
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,680
that you haven't forgotten
about it either.

191
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,440
Dong Shancai!

192
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
I like you.

193
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,960
I don't know why.

194
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,800
Even I'm surprised by how much I like you.

195
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,800
No matter where I go,
you're the only person that I see.

196
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,320
Shancai.

197
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
I know I'm annoying.

198
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,440
If you want to run away,
I'll chase after you.

199
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
If you run to Mars,

200
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
I'll go there too.

201
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
You stupid boy!

202
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
Why didn't you fight back?

203
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,080
If I fought back,

204
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,520
then I would really lose.

205
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,640
Can you stop crying?

206
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Just the few of them...

207
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
They...

208
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
They could never beat me.

209
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,680
But seeing you cry

210
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,600
makes me worried.

211
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,560
My life has no meaning without you.

212
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,440
When I'm awake, you're all I think of.

213
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,440
When I close my eyes, you're in my dreams.

214
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,800
I can only think of one thing.

215
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,480
I can't live without you.

216
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Shancai.

217
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,040
I've always done
what I wanted to do before.

218
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,400
But I don't know what to do anymore.

219
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,120
Please tell me.

220
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
What should I do
for me to continue loving you?

221
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Shancai's mine.

222
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
I can't let her be with another guy.

223
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,280
I want to win her heart.

224
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,320
Regardless if it's my mom...

225
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Even if the whole world wants me
to give up on her,

226
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,320
I'd never leave Shancai.

227
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,880
I never thought about giving up.

228
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,360
Not in the past, not now,

229
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,880
not in the future.

230
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,760
Your visit today

231
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,960
has proven that it's worth it.

232
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,400
Because...

233
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,800
only the Shancai who loves me
more than anything else,

234
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,440
who worries about me
suddenly disappearing,

235
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,880
would say those hurtful words to me.

236
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,400
I was so weak that I couldn't move,

237
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,000
but now I feel so much energy inside me.

238
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
You're giving me strength.

239
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
In this whole wide world,

240
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
only you...

241
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,120
I need Shancai by my side.

242
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,600
Only then can I keep going.

243
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
Daoming Si.

244
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
I understand.

245
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,600
From now on, I won't lie
to my heart anymore.

246
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,080
There's a wall between us,

247
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,240
but I'll always be on your side.

248
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
No matter what you do,

249
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,720
I won't let you be alone.

250
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,080
I'll always be by your side.

251
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,400
Didn't you say that

252
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,280
if I run away, you'll chase after me?

253
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
Even if I run to Mars,

254
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,880
you'll still chase me down.

255
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,520
Hey.

256
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,320
Is he willing to stop acting like that?
Is he willing to eat now?

257
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
He's not listening to you either?

258
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,160
If that's the case,

259
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
you can go now.

260
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,600
Hey, Shancai.

261
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,960
Shancai.

262
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm sorry about that.

263
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,400
Xiaozi.

264
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,960
I don't feel bad.

265
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,880
I'm actually glad

266
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,800
because I've never been so sure
about what I want.

267
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,840
I'm sorry. I couldn't convince him

268
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
because I understand what he's doing.

269
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,040
Maybe you don't understand,

270
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,120
but I do.

271
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,040
So I'll stand by him.

272
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,440
If he doesn't eat, I won't eat too.

273
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,000
If he doesn't come out,

274
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,120
I'll keep waiting for him.

275
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,400
Shancai!

276
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,240
Don't be silly like Si.

277
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
Xiaozi, you know how I am.

278
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,280
Don't think that I'll pity you
if you do that.

279
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Mrs. Daoming.

280
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,640
I'm not the one who needs sympathy.

281
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
It's you.

282
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,720
Shancai.

283
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,400
You should eat something. You've been here for so long.

284
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,320
Eat something.

285
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
At least drink some water.
You can't go on like this.

286
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,800
Whatever Si does,

287
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,120
I'll do the same.

288
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,000
If he stops eating and drinking,
I will too.

289
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,600
To the end of the world,

290
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,000
to hell or heaven,

291
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,080
I'll be with him.

292
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,480
Is this what we really want?

293
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,080
This is Si and Shancai's mutual decision.

294
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,920
You're in a rush to see me. What is it?

295
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,000
How can you be so cruel?

296
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,440
Your son is starving himself in the room.

297
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,880
The girl your son loves

298
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,640
is standing outside starving herself too.

299
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,480
Do you have a heart of stone?

300
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Is this what you wanted to talk about?

301
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,040
If Mrs. Yu didn't tell me,
you would've never told me, right?

302
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,880
Why would I tell you?

303
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,040
So that you can help your brother escape?

304
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,440
Did you forget that you wanted
to elope with someone too?

305
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,440
What happened then?

306
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,000
The man who promised
to be with you forever

307
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,440
ran away like a coward.

308
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,800
If I didn't show you
what a wimp that man was,

309
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,639
I wouldn't know how your life
would've turned out.

310
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,679
My situation was different from Si.

311
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,040
I can't see what's different.

312
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,239
No matter what threats
or tortures you use,

313
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,760
you can't defeat Shancai.

314
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,199
She's braver than me.

315
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,080
Are you standing on her side
just to get revenge on me?

316
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,960
No.

317
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I just don't want to see
you make the same mistake.

318
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,120
Don't forget.

319
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,719
Your brother is the only son
of Daoming Group.

320
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,400
Daoming Group's future is his future.

321
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,520
I arranged the best path for him.

322
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,719
Would you want me to give your brother
a company that has failed?

323
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,400
The path you arranged isn't his.
It's your company's path.

324
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,320
Mom, why didn't you have more babies?

325
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,400
Whenever the company is in trouble,
you could sell another one.

326
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
Are you done?

327
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,760
You're a great businesswoman.

328
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
But, you don't know how to be a mother.

329
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,600
You don't understand.

330
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,480
Let me tell you one more time.

331
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm not just playing the role of a mother.

332
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
Si,

333
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,320
if you don't eat something,

334
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
your face which you think is handsome
will turn into a skull.

335
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,200
I think I'll look good

336
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,680
even with a skull for my head.

337
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,800
That's not true.

338
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,280
Get up now. I'm taking you to dinner.

339
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't want to see you like this.

340
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,600
And?

341
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
And?

342
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,240
What do you mean?

343
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,880
Should I accept Mom's arrangments

344
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,720
just like you?

345
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,560
Will I marry Xiaozi

346
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,640
and forget about the girl I love?

347
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,240
Should I?

348
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
We'll find a way.

349
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I know. But, Zhuang,

350
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,600
I'm doing this to let Mom understand.

351
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm not giving in.

352
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,920
I want her to know

353
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,440
how serious I take this relationship.

354
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Do you understand?

355
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,440
Yes.

356
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,240
Zhuang,

357
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
stop persuading me.

358
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm happy.

359
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
Because...

360
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,480
Shancai is on my side.

361
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm really glad that you have someone

362
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,240
who makes you happy.

363
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
So? What did you find out?

364
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,560
I heard someone in
the finance sector said that

365
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,080
Daoming Group was expanding too fast.

366
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
It can't keep up with new trends now.

367
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,680
That's why they lost so much money.

368
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,800
This is probably the reason
those employees were unhappy.

369
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,120
She wants Xiaozi in the family

370
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
because Xiaozi's dad is trying
to take advantage of their company

371
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,000
while they're in rough waters.

372
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,000
But he's worried that
Daoming Feng will retaliate.

373
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,680
That's a strategy in the business world.

374
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,160
Who would've thought

375
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,840
that Si's family was in so much trouble?

376
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,720
No wonder Mrs. Daoming was forced
to use such extreme measures.

377
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
But I don't understand.

378
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,200
Is that the only way to help
Daoming Group get back on track?

379
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,960
Of course not.

380
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,000
I think Si's mom doesn't know what to do.

381
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,040
Because she's lost her direction.

382
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
A successful businesswoman like her?

383
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,960
She doesn't trust anyone.

384
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,840
Her company was going
in the wrong direction,

385
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,400
and it couldn't find
new goals for this era.

386
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,800
But, we can't find those goals for her.

387
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,560
Who said so?

388
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,520
Don't forget.

389
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,320
When I was 18,
I made my first million in stock trading.

390
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,560
Actually, I already have a plan.

391
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,400
I'll marry Shancai first,

392
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,520
then I'll tell my mom the secret plan
I've long prepared.

393
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,640
And turn the Daoming Group
into a hotel group with a new concept.

394
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,600
What's your secret plan?

395
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Who has Si's email address?

396
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I think...

397
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,800
Si may have a good idea.

398
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,760
I do.

399
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,000
Stop delivering meals.

400
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Si won't eat anything. Stop preparing food for him.
