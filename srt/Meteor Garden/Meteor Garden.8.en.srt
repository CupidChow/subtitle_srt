00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,920
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
It's just shocking.

4
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,960
I never thought she was like that.

5
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,760
I thought we were friends.

6
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,760
You know?

7
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Is that what you call friendship?

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,400
She betrayed you without any guilt.

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,600
Yeah. We almost took the blame.

10
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,800
Who does she think she is?

11
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,560
All right. Settle down now.

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,960
This is a reminder.

13
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Turn in your group report

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,240
by the end of the month.

15
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,160
Please work together in groups

16
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,080
since you'll be getting the same grade.

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,200
Professor.

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,480
Can we switch groups?

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,400
What? Why?

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,560
We don't want to work with a liar

21
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,480
and get the same grade as her.

22
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,040
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,200
Who wants to work with her?

24
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,040
Is this about the Weibo rumor?

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,400
Yes, professor.

26
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,320
Li Zhen fabricated that rumor.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,960
You can ask Shancai.

28
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Shancai, tell everyone what happened.

29
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Professor,

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
Li Zhen did spread the false rumor,

31
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,440
which caused me a lot of trouble.

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,520
I went out with a few female classmates.

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,960
We had fun and got drunk.

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,360
Before Li Zhen went home,

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,800
she asked a foreigner
to take me to a hotel.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,720
To assure her that I was okay,
that foreigner friend

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,040
took a picture of me in the hotel room
and sent it to her.

38
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Li Zhen accidentally
posted the photo online.

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,840
Those Internet trolls
left terrible comments on it.

40
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,400
Li Zhen knew that she made a mistake.
She didn't know what to say.

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,120
That's what caused the misunderstanding.

42
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
Li Zhen, is that true?

43
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
It's true.

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,320
It had spread all over the school.

45
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,600
Why didn't she say anything?

46
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,000
-Li Zhen.
-Yeah.

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
-Because I...
-Because she's mad at me.

48
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,240
When I was at Jing's birthday party,

49
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,840
I didn't answer my phone.

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,040
She was outside in the rain all night
and couldn't get in.

51
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
I was the one who invited her.

52
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,120
I should have waited for her.

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
The next day, she caught a cold.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,440
She looked pale and ignored me.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
I have to go now.

56
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,520
I was stupid and didn't notice.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,800
I even told her how fun the party was.

58
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
It was all my fault.

59
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
But now I know that

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,040
I need to treat the important people
in my life better than others.

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,760
Professor,

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,160
we won't fight anymore.

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
Everyone, please don't be mad at Li Zhen.

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
We'll study hard from now on.

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,480
Okay. Please sit down.

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,040
Classmates should get along
and be nice to each other.

67
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I hope nothing like this happens again.

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's start the class.

69
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,960
Shancai would never do that.

70
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,680
Shancai,

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,960
why did you stand up for me
even though I did something so mean?

72
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,760
Because I know you.

73
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
We don't want to become despicable people.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,240
Do you remember?

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
When school had just started,

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,320
you said to me...

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,240
Shancai, it's good that I know you,

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,240
I'd be so lonely by myself.

79
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,640
We'll be best friends from now on
for the next four years.

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,760
I feel the same way too.

81
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm glad that I know you.

82
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Shancai, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,440
Please forgive me.

84
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,560
It's all right.

85
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
It's fine.

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,600
Shancai.

87
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,920
Someone's here for you.

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,680
See you later. Bye.

89
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,200
Give me your phone.

90
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,280
For what?

91
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Just give it to me.

92
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,400
Here.

93
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,560
-This isn't my phone.
-Idiot.

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm giving you this phone.

95
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
I broke your phone, didn't I?

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,720
You're the idiot.

97
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't want this phone.

98
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,240
Give me my phone.

99
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,760
Hey!

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,800
Give it back.

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
Give it to me. What are you looking at?

102
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
-Give me my phone.
-Shut up.

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,240
If you don't take it,

104
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,080
-I'll smash your mom's phone.
-You--

105
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,040
Try to explain that.

106
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,400
How do you know I have my mom's phone.

107
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,240
I went to your house yesterday
to ask your mom for your number.

108
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,280
She told me.

109
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,080
You asked my mom for my number?

110
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Your mom asked me for my number
and added me on WeChat.

111
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
She told me to take good care of you.

112
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,600
I can't believe her.

113
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,680
Anyways,

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,480
I need to be able to find you
at all times.

115
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,640
Understand?

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
What's your problem?

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm not a dog. Why should I listen to you?

118
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,360
Of course, you're not a dog.

119
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
Dogs are much more obedient.

120
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Daoming Si!

121
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
The couple's bickering again?

122
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,440
Who's bickering with...

123
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
Lei!

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
Hi, I'm back.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,400
He just arrived this morning.
He called us when he landed.

126
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,320
Si, we should get together tonight.

127
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
Sure.

128
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,800
Shancai, long time no see.

129
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,440
Welcome back.

130
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,640
Hey.

131
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,840
Shancai's my girlfriend now.

132
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
No, I'm not.

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,800
-Stop saying that.
-Really?

134
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
What a pity.

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,240
A handsome bachelor like me
just got taken.

136
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
It is a pity indeed.

137
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,440
It's a pity because we'll never
have peace and quiet again.

138
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
Yeah.

139
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,280
They bicker more in a day
than we do in a year.

140
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,560
Cut it out.

141
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,600
Let's go to class. Hey.

142
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,840
It looks like a fan, it feels like a fan.

143
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,560
It is a fan, so why isn't it working?

144
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,480
Because it isn't plugged in.

145
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,800
You're so smart!

146
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
Even an idiot could answer that.

147
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,920
Lame.

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,960
-Hey, Shancai.
-What's going on?

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
What are these appliances...

150
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,920
-How can you afford them?
-Of course, we can't.

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
They're all from Daoming Si.

152
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,120
Daoming Si is really a nice person. -Yeah.
-Daoming Si...

153
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,400
Who said he could give us these?

154
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
I never agreed.

155
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
Shancai, come back.

156
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
We have a lot of boxes to open.

157
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Do you like them?

158
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,400
I picked them out myself. I hate them!

159
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,080
Why are you yelling at me?

160
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,560
Your roof might blow off.

161
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,960
Our house is unlivable anyways.

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,360
You gave us so many appliances,
we can't even walk in here.

163
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,360
Are they that big?

164
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,040
I thought they would fit.

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,840
Maybe you could sleep on them.

166
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,200
You're ridiculous. I can't talk to you.

167
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,320
If you can't talk, let's meet up.

168
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,280
My driver will pick you up in ten minutes.

169
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,880
What?

170
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,440
"If you can't talk, let's meet up."

171
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
What kind of logic is that?

172
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
All girls like sweet talk.

173
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,960
Before Si learns how to do that,
he should just shut up.

174
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,040
Yeah.

175
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
Where's Lei?

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,040
I haven't seen him for a while.

177
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,600
He said he needed some air.
He'll be back soon.

178
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,080
I feel like Lei came back
as a different person this time.

179
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,080
How is he different?

180
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
-You don't know?
-Yeah.

181
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,960
Hey, over here.

182
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,880
-Hi.
-Hi. Who is it?

183
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,200
Are you a turtle? What took you so long?

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,840
How dare you say that?

185
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
Let me get this straight,
why should I show up

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,360
-whenever you want me to?
-Because I want to see you.

187
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
Who do you think you are?

188
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,520
Hey, Shancai.

189
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
This is Kiki.

190
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,480
I finally get to meet the F4. When can I play Bridge with you?

191
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,320
If you want to play,

192
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,400
Lei can bring you here anytime.

193
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,000
-We're okay whenever.
-Really?

194
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
That's great.

195
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,280
Come on.

196
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,120
Why are you spacing out?

197
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Sit down. This is yours.

198
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,560
What are you doing?

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
Here.

200
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,400
Wipe your mouth.

201
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,840
What did Lei do in Paris?

202
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
He's changed so much.

203
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,000
I think he grew up.

204
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
But we don't know
how long he'll be like this.

205
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Something's wrong between him and Jing.

206
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm going home.

207
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Now?

208
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,200
You just got here.

209
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,080
I just came to tell you

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
to get all those appliances
out of my house.

211
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
Or I'm throwing them out. Bye.

212
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
-I'll walk you out.
-No, I can go by myself.

213
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
Hey. Hey.

214
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,640
Huaze Lei has totally changed.

215
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,600
What happened between him and Jing?

216
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
What the hell?

217
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
He's sitting there

218
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,720
just like he used to.

219
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,480
It's like nothing has changed.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,800
What are you looking at? A plane just flew by.

221
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,440
-You and Jing--
-You're dating Si?

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,280
I'm not.

223
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,080
I never agreed to it.

224
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
It's all his idea.

225
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Good.

226
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,080
Shancai, be my girlfriend.

227
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,240
Am I not better than Si?

228
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Are you...

229
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,240
Are you really Huaze Lei?

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,480
I'm just kidding.

231
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
Did you believe me?

232
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,200
You're so cute.

233
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
Kidding?

234
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
I can't steal Si's girlfriend.

235
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,640
He's my brother.

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,800
Are you disappointed?

237
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,960
How about

238
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,480
we secretly date behind Si's back?

239
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,160
Doesn't that sound exciting?

240
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,440
Did you believe it again?

241
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
Class is starting.

242
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,480
I need to go.

243
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,240
Shancai,

244
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
you're even prettier now.

245
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,000
Thanks.

246
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,960
-Hey. What are you doing?
-Come with me.

247
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
I'm busy.

248
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,080
I need to work.

249
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,320
-I'm not rich like you.
-Shut up.

250
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,920
-I've already told them you're not going.
-What?

251
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE

252
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
Hey. Wait.

253
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,000
Where are you taking me?

254
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
-On a trip.
-A trip?

255
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,560
I didn't agree to that.

256
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,480
-I didn't tell my parents--
-They already gave me permission.

257
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
I told the tea shop too.

258
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,680
It's the weekend, so you don't have class.

259
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,840
I brought everything you need.
Your clothes and your passport.

260
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,160
Any other questions?

261
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,960
If not, let's go. Everyone's waiting.

262
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,079
Everyone?

263
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey.

264
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm warning you.

265
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,480
When we get to the island,
don't run off on your own.

266
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
-Is it dangerous there?
-Yes.

267
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,480
You're a ticking time-bomb.

268
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,720
-You might hurt someone.
-Daoming Si.

269
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,760
Passengers, we have come across
some turbulence.

270
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,880
For your safety, please stay in your seat
and fasten your seatbelt.

271
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

272
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,200
Strike a pose.

273
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,360
Where do you want to go first?

274
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,560
You decide.

275
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,680
-Really?
-Of course.

276
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,120
You scared me.

277
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,440
Who said you could look at another man?

278
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,960
That's none of your business.

279
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
-Are you jealous again?
-Of course, I am.

280
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
It's so beautiful!

281
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,160
It's like a postcard.

282
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,160
Do you like it?

283
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
It's the best room in the hotel.

284
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,280
The sky and sea are so blue.

285
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,120
It's wonderful!

286
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,600
Shancai,

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,240
this is our room.

288
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,000
What? I...

289
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,200
We're staying in the same room?

290
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
Don't worry.

291
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
It's the same room,

292
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,560
but we'll sleep in separate beds.

293
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,800
That's not what I mean.

294
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,160
What do you mean then?

295
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
I...

296
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

297
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

298
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Here. Meizuo.

299
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,280
-Yeah?
-Perform for us. All right, listen up.

300
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
3.14159

301
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,920
265358

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,040
97932

303
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
384626.

304
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,160
Lei.

305
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,120
Lei...

306
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,080
Your friend is so amusing.

307
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,000
What about me?

308
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,920
Am I not amusing?

309
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
Don't you play the violin? When will you play it for me?

310
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,400
Only special people
can hear me play the violin.

311
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,240
How do I become a special person?

312
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
You need to like me more.

313
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
Do I not like you enough?

314
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,400
That's not fair. I like you a lot.

315
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,080
You're so naughty.

316
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,640
He came back from Paris as a real man.

317
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
Looks like now we only need
to wait for Si to grow up.

318
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,880
Shancai,

319
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
will you wait for him?

320
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,240
Stop it.

321
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,640
Shut up.

322
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,800
Try it.

323
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
-The chicken is really good.
-I agree.

324
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
One, two, three, cheese.

325
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,560
I know I'm attractive,

326
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,840
but do you have to keep staring at me?

327
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,680
Who was staring at you?

328
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,320
You're so full of yourself.

329
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,280
Aren't you sleeping
on that bed over there?

330
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,560
Why? Can't I sit here for a while?

331
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,960
Don't worry.

332
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,000
I do like you,

333
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,520
but before you like me back,
I won't do anything to you.

334
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
I'd never touch a woman
without her consent.

335
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
I think...

336
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,200
Your legs are sticking out.

337
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,040
Do you want to sleep over there?

338
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,520
It's fine.

339
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,080
How about you just say you like me?

340
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,920
I don't know how much longer I can wait.

341
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,560
Or do you want to sleep
on this tiny bed with me?

342
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,040
No!

343
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,280
Lei,

344
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,440
what's up with you?

345
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,240
Ever since you came back from Paris,

346
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,480
you've totally changed.

347
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,480
Are you worried about me?

348
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
It's normal to be worried
about friends, isn't it?

349
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,080
It's because of Jing, isn't it?

350
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,360
What are you doing?

351
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,960
Ten minutes.

352
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,520
No, five minutes is enough.

353
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,760
I'm fine during the day,

354
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,600
but I can't deal with it at night.

355
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,680
Can you give me a hug?

356
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,160
Why don't you ask that girl to hug you?

357
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,280
I don't want to be touched
by a woman I don't know.

358
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,640
This is the first time
I've seen Huaze Lei so vulnerable.

359
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,000
And I realized that I never gave up on him.

360
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,560
Shancai...

361
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,720
I found out that Jing

362
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,840
doesn't need me.

363
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,360
Jing and I lived together
in Paris for a while.

364
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,520
I still remember

365
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,200
the look on her face

366
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,880
when she saw me that day.

367
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,480
We stayed at home when we were free.

368
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,480
We never got tired of it.

369
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,440
It was our own little world.

370
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,080
It was the best time of my life.

371
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
But

372
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,400
it didn't last very long.

373
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,680
She went to school during the day
and interned at a law firm at night.

374
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,480
I was alone all day without her.

375
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,960
She smiled less and less.

376
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,840
She became more tired.

377
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,320
She built a wall around her.

378
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,960
Even if I had turned into air,

379
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
I couldn't find a way in.

380
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,120
You know how
I was slightly autistic before.

381
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Jing led me out of the shadows of autism.

382
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,920
But I never changed.

383
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,440
I was still the child
who hid in the corner.

384
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,200
I couldn't do anything
for the girl I loved.

385
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,120
I'm sorry.

386
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

387
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,560
Thank you for listening to me.

388
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,240
Did you find her? No.

389
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,000
Where did she go at this hour?
She's not picking up her phone.

390
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,920
How about we split up and look for her?

391
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
Sure. Okay.

392
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,720
Where did you go?

393
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,760
Why weren't you picking up?

394
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,040
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk on the beach.

395
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,560
I forgot to bring my phone.

396
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,960
Idiot. Couldn't you leave a note?

397
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,680
All right. Don't worry.

398
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,920
It's fine now.

399
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,440
If you do that again, I...

400
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,360
-You'll what?
-Shancai, do you know what Si did?

401
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,320
He came to my room and yelled,

402
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,480
"Shancai drowned in the sea!"

403
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,160
I had to come out and look for you.

404
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,160
That's enough.

405
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,240
Go to bed.

406
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Fine.

407
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,840
We all know whom Si loves more.

408
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,440
-We'll give you some privacy.
-Let's go.

409
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,080
What are you still doing here? Go to bed.

410
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,520
Did you know that Huaze Lei
didn't come back to the room last night?

411
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,600
I asked him and he said
he was at the beach all night.

412
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,760
You would think that he had a mistress.

413
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,800
He's probably just shy.

414
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
Really?

415
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,960
Where did you go?

416
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,840
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk on the beach.

417
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,240
Huaze Lei doesn't seem happy lately.

418
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
-Why?
-I...

419
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,560
Lei.

420
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Did you see Shancai
at the beach last night?

421
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah.

422
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,160
I was there thinking,
and she came out for a walk.

423
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,800
She saw me and we chatted for a bit.

424
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,720
Oh.

425
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,440
TENG TANGJING, EXCHANGE STUDENT IN FRANCE
EXPECTED TO WED THIS YEAR

426
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,880
"Teng Tangjing, an exchange student,

427
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,360
fell in love with the son
of the mayor of Paris.

428
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,200
They are expected to get married...

429
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,480
by year-end."

430
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,080
Did you know about that?

431
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
Yes.

432
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
It's big news in Paris.

433
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,840
Is that why you came back? Lei, do you not care?

434
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,960
Jing's about to marry someone else.

435
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,440
Why should I care?

436
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,440
Everything's over now.

437
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
That's why he's changed so much.

438
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,640
He must be shocked by Jing's engagement.

439
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
Are you all right?

440
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,520
Yes.

441
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,600
Really?

442
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,760
You don't look okay at all.

443
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,400
I want to know too.

444
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,200
Will I get better?

445
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,280
You will.

446
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,560
You'll get better.

447
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,120
Because

448
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,000
you're a wonderful

449
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
and very talented person.

450
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,400
How could you not get better?

451
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,840
Why are you crying?

452
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,760
I told you I'm okay.

453
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,920
Go back to your room.
Don't worry about me.

454
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,280
I don't know...

455
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,240
I just can't stop thinking about you.

456
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm always wondering

457
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,880
why you're so unhappy

458
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
and what will happen between you and Jing.

459
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm also wondering...

460
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,640
why you can't be happier.

461
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,080
Why aren't you the one I love?

462
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,760
Si.

463
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
Daoming Si! Wait.

464
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Listen to me.

465
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,760
Everything's clear now.

466
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,600
What is there to say?

467
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
No, it's not what it seems like.

468
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,520
Don't touch me!

469
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,200
Dong Shancai, ever since the beginning,

470
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
I've liked you and only you.

471
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,480
But what about you?

472
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm sorry.

473
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,480
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

474
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,520
Si.

475
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,920
You have no right to talk to me.

476
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,760
I can't believe Si just left without us.

477
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,800
Wasn't everything fine yesterday?

478
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,320
Something must've happened.

479
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,720
Lei, did you see Si?

480
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,080
No.

481
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,240
We'll ask him when we get back.

482
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,160
Let's go.

483
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Come on.

484
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,560
It's not ready yet.

485
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,000
-Shancai, welcome home.
-Welcome home.

486
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,920
Are you tired from your trip?

487
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,880
You look exhausted.

488
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
Of course, she is.

489
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,680
The pictures she sent were beautiful.

490
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,800
She must have had a lot of fun
and stayed up late, right?

491
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,840
Right?

492
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,440
It was very beautiful.

493
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,640
Shancai, tell me.

494
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,200
What happened between you and Daoming Si?

495
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,240
Did you guys create
some beautiful memories there?

496
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,440
This is your daughter
you're talking about.

497
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,360
Girls need to protect themselves.

498
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,480
Right?

499
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
What were you thinking?

500
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,320
I meant candle-lit dinners,
holding hands, and embraces.

501
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,440
Daoming Si is such a handsome young man.

502
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,040
-It must've been so dreamy. Wasn't it?
-That's exaggerating.

503
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,720
Our daughter is the best.

504
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,960
Even that Daoming Si guy doesn't
deserve her, you know?

505
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,600
Dad, Mom,

506
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,480
stop talking about Daoming Si.

507
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,920
It's over.

508
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
What do you mean, over?

509
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
Isn't he trying to win you over? Shancai?

510
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
That's enough.

511
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,280
Stop pestering her.

512
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,400
She's clearly not happy.

513
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,120
But didn't Daoming Si come
to our house just a few days ago?

514
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,880
How is it over already? I have to know the reason.

515
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,480
What if our daughter
got dumped or abandoned?

516
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,360
What can you do?

517
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,720
Then I hope that
he grows shorter every day.

518
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,680
Which part?

519
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,000
His hair.

520
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,080
If he's bald,
he won't get a new girlfriend.

521
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,520
Good thing I have a lot of hair.

522
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,440
Idiot.

523
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,480
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

524
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,960
I need to be able to find you
at all times.

525

AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

526
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,760
Do you like them?
I picked them out myself.

527
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,600
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

528
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,440
Why are you yelling at me?

529
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,600
Your roof might blow off.

530
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,560
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

531
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,920
Are they that big?

532
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,480
I thought they would fit.

533
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,200
Maybe you could sleep on them.

534
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,120
AUDIO MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

535
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,520
If you can't talk, let's meet up.

536
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,480
My driver will pick you up in ten minutes.

537
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,960
Daoming Si was so nice to me, but I hurt him.

538
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,280
Maybe

539
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
he hates me now.

540
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,960
I didn't like him anyway.

541
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,360
A lot of bad things happened.

542
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,560
But maybe this is the best ending.

543
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,640
Hello? Yes.

544
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,640
I need to tell you something about Si.
