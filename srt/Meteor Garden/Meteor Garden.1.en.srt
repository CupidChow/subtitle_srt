00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 1

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,320
Have you ever wondered
what will happen to you in the future?

4
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,600
At least the 18-year-old me

5
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,960
never thought something like this
would happen in real life.

6
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,880
My name is Dong Shancai.

7
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,520
I'm just an ordinary 18-year-old girl.

8
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
This is my mother.

9
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,400
She has plump cheeks,
stubby legs, and a loud voice.

10
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,160
She's very healthy
and has an optimistic outlook on life.

11
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I think I'm a lot like her.

12
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
You silly girl.

13
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,880
How did your face get so dirty
just by buying vegetables?

14
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,600
I'd like this one.

15
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Sweet and sour pork ribs is
the signature dish of the Dong family.

16
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,080
Ever since I was a child,

17
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,400
eating my mom's food together
at the table has been the best thing ever.

18
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,680
What smells so good?

19
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
It looks delicious.

20
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Done.

21
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,600
Silly girl. Who said you could have some?

22
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
This is for our customers.

23
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,720
You've had them for 18 years.
Isn't that enough?

24
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,240
I'll never have enough.

25
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,480
I made up my mind to get into
Mingde University's Nutrition Department

26
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,320
so that I could expand
my mom's catering business.

27
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,440
I want more people to enjoy her food.

28
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,080
My Sweetheart.

29
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
Dad.

30
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,480
This is my dad.

31
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
He's just an ordinary logistics manager.

32
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,400
But he's also a good husband
who loves his wife

33
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,200
and a good father who loves his daughter.

34
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,079
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,360
This is my high school classmate, Xiaoyou.

36
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
She loves tea,

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,960
so after taking the college entrance exam,
we worked part-time at this tea shop.

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
It was a long and peaceful summer.

39
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Just like the last 18 years.

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,760
But, the peace was broken on that day.

41
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
-Three.
-Three. -Two.
-Two.

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
-One.
-One.

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,640
-You got in!
-You got in!

44
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,600
-I got in!
-Xiaoyou got into

45
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
-That's awesome!
-Tea Culture Department at Chaoyang

46
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
and I...

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
CELEBRATION BANQUET

48
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,360
Thanks to all her teachers,

49
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
our baby girl Shancai
got into Mingde University.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,960
-Congratulations to Shancai!
-Congratulations!

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
-Thank you.
-Cheers!

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Thank you.

53
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,280
I got into the school of my dreams,
Mingde University.

54
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,240
And I became a freshman
in the Nutrition Department.

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,880
Mom.

56
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Is this the legendary Mingde University?

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
Yes.

58
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,080
It's the best school.

59
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
Shancai, work hard.

60
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,760
Your future starts here.

61
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Fist bump? Cheers.

62
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
Shancai. I'm so happy

63
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
that we got into Mingde together.

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,200
My best friend in high school
will now be my best friend in university.

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm so lucky.

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
It's better than winning the lottery.

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,720
I'm happy too!

68
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,760
Shancai.

69
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
You're...

70
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,280
Let me think about it.

71
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,160
Li Zhen.

72
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,280
You're the quiet girl with
the best grades in the other class.

73
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,480
This is Chen Qinghe.

74
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
He's my best friend.

75
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,040
We were classmates in high school
and got into the same university.

76
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,480
You must be very close.

77
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Of course, we're so close

78
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,800
that I applied to the same
universities as her.

79
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Why did you apply
to the same universities?

80
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,400
I didn't want to be apart from her.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,440
Also, it doesn't matter what I major in.

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm going to take over the family company,
a banana processing factory.

83
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,080
Bananas are great.
They're very nutritious and delicious.

84
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Yes, most importantly,

85
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
they're never lonely. Bananas are never lonely?

86
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,920
Because...

87
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,440
-Bananas hang around in bunches!
-Bananas hang around in bunches!

88
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
-You're so in sync.
-Of course.

89
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,320
No matter what,

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm going to be Shancai's classmate again.

91
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
Shancai, it's good that I know you,

92
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,480
I'd be so lonely all by myself.

93
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,680
We'll be best friends from now on
for the next four years.

94
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,200
I, Dong Shancai, am ready.

95
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm going to work hard
at Mingde University

96
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
and start this new chapter in my life.

97
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,080
-Are you okay?
-Be careful.

98
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,520
-I'm fine.
-Sit down.

99
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
-The lecture's about to start.
-Hurry up.

100
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,799
Next, let's welcome our guest
from University of Pennsylvania,

101
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
Mr. Bobbit.

102
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,600
-Mr. Bobbit?
-So impressive.

103
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,800
I can't believe Mingde invited him.

104
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm going to tell my parents.

105
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
They'll be so jealous.

106
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,120
Hey, look at my pictures.

107
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,000
Shancai, you got really good ones.

108
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,040
Send this one to me.

109
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,080
-I'm making birthday emojis.
-It's your birthday?

110
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,680
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

111
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
It's not today. It's in two days.

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,800
-I sent it.
-Okay.

113
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,280
-That lecture was awesome.
-Look.

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
-That's great.
-Yeah.

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,840
I think so too.

116
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
Hey, who's that?

117
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
-I don't know.
-What's happening?

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Is it F4?

119
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,400
-Let's go take a look.
-Okay.

120
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
Shancai!

121
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,240
Sorry. Excuse me.

122
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360
Dong Shancai,

123
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
go home and reflect
upon your actions today.

124
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Regardless of the reason,

125
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,960
you should never be
so rude to our school's

126
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,000
special guest, Mr. Bobbit!

127
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Look, that's her.

128
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,200
She's that freshman, Dong Shancai?

129
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
Why did she attack Mr. Bobbit?

130
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah, is she crazy?

131
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,280
Something must be wrong with her.

132
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,280
This is terrible.

133
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,080
Is she really a student here?

134
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah.

135
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,120
Look. That's her.

136
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,720
Shancai, are you hurt?

137
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
Shancai, I'm sorry.

138
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,640
It was all my fault.

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,280
I wasn't able to protect you.

140
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,000
Why did you attack Mr. Bobbit?

141
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,760
I didn't want to attack him.

142
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,640
I was trying to find
the F4 member with green shoes.

143
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,840
One of them stepped
on my phone and broke it.

144
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
F4?

145
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,720
Who's F4?

146
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Where are they?

147
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,520
Are they the ones
those girls were taking photos of?

148
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,120
They seem to be very popular.

149
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,680
The F4 members are very popular seniors.

150
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,520
Are you guys new? Yes.

151
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,120
We're freshmen
from the Nutrition Department.

152
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
And you are?

153
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,840
Junior in Journalism. I'm Guo Caijie.

154
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,640
You're so pretty.

155
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,560
Caijie,

156
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,520
why is F4 so popular?

157
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,680
They're four senior students at Mingde.

158
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Their average height is 185cm.

159
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,760
They're all very handsome,
talented and outgoing.

160
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,880
Most importantly, at school,

161
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,880
they all excel in their respective fields.

162
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,960
Huaze Lei majors in music.

163
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,280
 Ximen, Meizuo, and Daoming Si

164
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
major in business administration.

165
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,640
They attract a lot of attention at school.

166
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,520
They always get the best scholarships

167
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
and they're all skilled
in at least three languages.

168
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,520
They're not only smart,
they have great taste too.

169
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,920
They might look like players,

170
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,160
but they respect women.

171
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,240
The four of them are very close.

172
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,160
They've been friends
since they were little.

173
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,560
It's almost impossible
for someone new to join them.

174
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,280
Because of that,

175
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,000
F4 has always been
very mysterious at Mingde.

176
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,120
The girls all love them,

177
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,680
and there are a lot of boys
who want to prove

178
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,520
that they're better than them.

179
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,160
These boys challenge them
to prove that they're more popular

180
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,840
and more attractive.

181
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,000
Challenge? How do they challenge them?

182
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
With Bridge.

183
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
-Bridge?
-Bridge?

184
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,520
What is Bridge?

185
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,960
I've never heard of it.

186
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,360
Bridge is an international card game
that's elegant and civilized.

187
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,160
It's competitive and requires skill
and cooperation.

188
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,480
They're not only the stars of Mingde,
they're also stars in the Bridge world.

189
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,320
If anyone wants to beat them,

190
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,720
they'll have to be really good.

191
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,840
But, since F4 founded the Bridge club,

192
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,520
no one has been able to beat them.

193
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
They're that good?

194
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,320
The four of them have different
strengths when playing Bridge.

195
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,960
Feng Meizuo is the artistic one.

196
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,640
He loves literature and art.

197
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,160
He's good at designing exhibitions
and holding salons.

198
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
At the Bridge table,
he has incredible memory.

199
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
He never forgets anything.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
He's also very humorous.

201
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,320
After listening to his jokes,

202
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,720
his opponents often lower their defense.

203
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
They start to take
the game less seriously.

204
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,840
Ximen is very subtle and cautious.

205
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,400
His family adores tea.

206
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,800
He is very skilled in the art of tea.

207
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
At the Bridge table,
he's good at strategies.

208
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,480
He knows how to play mind games.

209
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,000
He distracts his opponents.

210
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,800
They often don't even know how they lost.

211
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
They call him the Battle God.

212
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Huaze Lei is a music genius.

213
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,480
He has perfect pitch
and plays many instruments.

214
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,240
He earns many
music scholarships every year.

215
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,920
At the Bridge table, he's calm and poised.

216
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,280
The opponent can never tell
what his hand is like.

217
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
Some say he has laser eyes

218
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,080
that can see through others' trickery.

219
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,600
Also, they say that when
the opponent sees his smile,

220
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,800
they'll give up their best card.

221
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
As for the leader of F4, Daoming Si,

222
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,560
he has great interest
and talent in finance.

223
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,400
When he turned 18,
he earned a million yuan

224
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,840
through trading securities.

225
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,320
That made him a legend
at Mingde's business school.

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,080
At the Bridge table, he's very aggressive.

227
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,640
Some people sit down
and get scared into making mistakes.

228
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,000
They fail to utilize their best cards

229
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,520
and regret it afterwards.

230
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
The four of them

231
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,119
have won many Bridge awards
for the school.

232
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,400
The school is very proud of them.

233
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
That's awesome.

234
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,440
Even if they're good at cards,

235
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,560
they should apologize
when they break someone's phone.

236
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,839
Yeah, we should go
to their club right now.

237
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,280
If they don't apologize,

238
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,240
I'll challenge them and beat them.

239
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,599
It's not that easy to challenge them.

240
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
You have to get the joker first.

241
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,560
What's the joker?

242
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,640
F4's challenge invitation.

243
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,440
-Invitation?
-Invitation?

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,320
So many people want to challenge them.

245
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,360
They got annoyed and made this rule.

246
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,760
Anyone who wants to challenge them
needs to find the opportunity

247
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,440
to tell them in person
that they want a challenge.

248
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,520
If F4 believes that you're qualified,

249
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,840
they'll give you a joker card
and give you a time.

250
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,760
But, before the game,
you need to wager something.

251
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,880
Wager something?

252
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,160
There's a lot of rumors about that.

253
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,320
Some are funny.

254
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
Some are unbelievable.

255
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,280
For example?

256
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,960
For example,

257
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,480
if you lose, you'll have to clean
the school for one semester.

258
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,120
or squat in the school fountain
for half a day,

259
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,600
or stay the night in the biology lab
with all the specimens.

260
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,360
That person fainted.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
Or, you might have to eat a hundred steamed pork buns in an hour.

262
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
Some losers have to do
a traditional dance by the sea.

263
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,640
One of the most ridiculous rumors

264
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,480
that no one has been able to prove yet

265
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
is that one time, someone who lost to them

266
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,520
had to eat a pair of slippers.

267
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,920
So? Do you still want to challenge them?

268
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
That's the Bridge club.

269
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,200
Good luck.

270
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,160
Shancai, should we go find them?

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Yes. Why not?

272
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,040
The guy with green shoes
is the one in the wrong.

273
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,280
I'm not afraid.

274
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah, why should we be afraid?

275
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Let's go.

276
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,640
-Right here?
-Yeah. Right here.

277
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,680
F4. Come out right now.

278
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeah. F4, come out right now!

279
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
The guy in the green shoes,
you broke my phone.

280
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,320
You have to buy me a new one.

281
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,320
Yeah. Buy Shancai a phone!

282
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,520
If you don't come out, we're coming in.

283
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,840
Yeah.

284
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,400
If you don't come out,
we're coming in to challenge you.

285
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,680
I think they're not here.

286
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,080
Let's go.

287
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

288
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,320
According to what Caijie just said,
they should be easy to find.

289
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,360
That's right.

290
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,760
If we see some tall, long-legged,

291
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,480
arrogantly handsome guys,

292
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,880
it should be them.

293
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,240
What?

294
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Is that them?

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I think so.

296
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,680
I can feel their presence.

297
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,320
Hey.

298
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Green shoe guy.

299
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,080
What do you want?

300
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
-What's this?
-A broken phone.

301
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,040
Do you know why it's broken?

302
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
-It's none of my business.
-None of your business?

303
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,360
You broke it by stepping on it.

304
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
When?

305
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,080
After the lecture.

306
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,240
Those girls wanted to see you
and they pushed me.

307
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,600
My phone fell on the floor.

308
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,680
You stepped on it and broke it.

309
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,960
Hey! I'm not done yet!

310
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
That's enough.

311
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,480
-Stop it.
-Hey!

312
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,240
Shancai, stop it.

313
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,680
Hey!

314
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm Professor Ma.
This is Introduction to Nutrition. This is your first class.

315
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,960
Can anyone tell me why you came to Mingde?

316
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
This is the best school.

317
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,800
To get hands-on experience.

318
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
Learn how to work with others.

319
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,800
Mingde has the best teachers
and learning environment.

320
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,640
So, we'll become top students.

321
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
Good answers, everyone.

322
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,240
But, what I want to tell you is that

323
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
most people won't pass.

324
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
During these four years,

325
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
I will hold you to the strictest criteria.

326
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
You might feel tortured.

327
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
You might hate me.

328
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Even so,

329
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,160
I won't make it easier for you.

330
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,880
Let me tell you this.

331
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
We have limited capability,

332
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
but...

333
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,440
WE HAVE UNLIMITED DETERMINATION.

334
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,800
We have unlimited determination.

335
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Don't be held back by your capability.

336
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,320
Now, form groups of four.

337
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
We're going to do group reports.

338
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,080
Silly girl. What are you doing?

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
Mom.

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,760
A girl from my high school, Li Zhen,
got into Mingde with me.

341
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,400
Tomorrow's her birthday.

342
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,240
I want to make a delicious
but low-fat cake for her.

343
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,880
There's no such thing as a low-fat cake.

344
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,080
Of course, there is.

345
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,880
Our nutrition professor said

346
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,280
you can use skimmed milk
instead of whole milk

347
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,800
and half the amount of sugar.

348
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,760
Look what you've learned already.

349
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,800
That cake is looking good.

350
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,040
How can you get your face dirty
by making a cake?

351
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
All right. Carry on.

352
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,360
Shancai.

353
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,400
It's kind of ugly. I hope you don't mind.

354
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,320
I love it.

355
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,280
Did you know that this is the first time
someone made a cake for me?

356
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,880
I don't have money to buy a nice gift.

357
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,040
This is nothing big.

358
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,400
It's low in fat so you won't gain weight.

359
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,640
-There's a card too.
-Hey!

360
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
Don't read it yet. Read it at home.

361
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,480
I'll feel embarrassed.

362
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,400
How about we take a photo with the cake?

363
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,360
There's a lot of people here.

364
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
Let's go...

365
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
Over there.

366
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,440
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

367
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,600
How about here?

368
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
-Let's take the photo here.
-Okay.

369
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
Stand over there. I'll take one of you.

370
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,280
Okay.

371
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
-A bit to the right.
-Like this?

372
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,840
I can't get the cake in. -Step back a bit.
-Okay.

373
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,800
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

374
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,600
You scared me. Be careful.

375
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
-Here's your phone.
-But my cake...

376
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,400
I need to get it.

377
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,400
You again.

378
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

379
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,040
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

380
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,840
Si, let me help you clean up.

381
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,520
-Go away!
-Hey!

382
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,880
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

383
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,720
Hey! Come back here!

384
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,560
She didn't mean to do it.

385
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,520
She apologized to you, didn't she?

386
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,160
Why do you have to be so mean?

387
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,920
You're an arrogant,
green shoe-wearing, pineapple head.

388
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,040
You think you're popular at school so you can do whatever you want.

389
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,280
You didn't apologize
for breaking my phone.

390
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,800
You're just a jerk.

391
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,520
You.

392
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,600
You've got guts.

393
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,360
Shancai, why did you argue with him?

394
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,560
I don't know why I was so mad.

395
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,480
Okay, I won't do it again.

396
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,200
A joker card?

397
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,560
Shancai, why would you get a joker card?

398
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,680
I bet it's because you made
Si mad that day.

399
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,600
Si wants me to play cards with him?

400
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,240
I don't have time for that.

401
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,800
Shancai, where are you going?

402
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
For a walk.

403
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,200
Those stupid people.

404
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,000
All I want to do is study.

405
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
I didn't want a joker card. They broke my phone

406
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,760
and embarrassed me in front of everyone.

407
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,680
F4.

408
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,480
You're all jerks.

409
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,800
I hope that from tomorrow,

410
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,080
your phone signals
will be blocked by aliens.

411
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,800
No calls, no texts, no games, no internet.
No phone in your life.

412
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,560
You'll step on your own foot and fall.

413
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,560
You'll dream of zombies
that eat your face.

414
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,960
Your nostril hair will grow

415
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,200
until it penetrates your head
and becomes your hair.

416
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,200
And then?

417
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,600
What happens after it becomes my hair?

418
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,760
-Then--
-Will you be happy?

419
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,480
Are you trying to bully me too?

420
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,560
Why would I do that?

421
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,360
Aren't you a member of F4?

422
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,520
Yes.

423
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,840
I really have no interest
in other people's business.

424
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,720
Here.

425
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,200
-Pass it.
-Pass the ball.

426
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Over here.

427
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,240
-Nice!
-Yeah!

428
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,120
Go, Si!

429
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,240
All right.

430
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,920
Hey, Shancai.

431
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,320
Come over here.

432
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,720
Come here.

433
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,280
Shancai, look.

434
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
That's the boy I like.

435
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,760
I want to take a video.

436
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,720
When I give him this drink,

437
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,040
take a video of us.

438
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,560
I need to go somewhere.

439
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,920
-See you later.
-Hey.

440
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,040
Shancai.

441
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,680
Don't be so petty.

442
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,120
Can't you help me out?

443
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Fine.

444
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,480
Wait.

445
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,240
It's for you...

446
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,520
Are you filming me?

447
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,320
Who's filming you?

448
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,800
What are you doing?

449
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,080
Shancai.

450
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,240
-Yes?
-A customer ordered 20 takeouts.

451
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,400
-Can you deliver them?
-Okay.

452
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,440
Sir, excuse me. Where's the Halftime Cafe?

453
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,800
Thanks.

454
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,600
HALFTIME CAFE

455
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,360
Sir, here's your takeout.

456
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,200
You?

457
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,120
You ordered takeout?

458
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,080
Yeah.

459
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,600
Shouldn't you be glad

460
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,640
that I'm supporting your family?

461
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,120
Here are your 20 takeout meals.

462
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,000
Please enjoy.

463
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,360
Stop. What?

464
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,240
I didn't check the food yet.

465
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,040
I need to make sure
you didn't get my order wrong.

466
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,760
This is what your family sells?

467
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,960
It doesn't look good at all.

468
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,520
Then don't eat it.

469
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,320
I'll take it back.

470
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,440
I spent money on them.

471
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'll give them to whoever I want.

472
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,400
Do you have a problem with that?

473
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,320
I know you're bullying me.

474
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,120
But you shouldn't waste food like this.

475
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,320
Do you know how much time my mom
spends on making these lunch boxes?

476
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,280
Enough is enough.

477
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,520
Is it my problem now?

478
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,000
You should be nicer to your customers.

479
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,719
I'm nice to good customers.

480
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,040
You don't deserve it.

481
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,239
Say that again.

482
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,520
Or what?

483
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,760
They say only the elite can go to Mingde.

484
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,760
They're polite and have good manners.

485
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,040
But when I see you,

486
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,000
I feel ashamed for you.

487
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,600
You don't know how hard
other people have to work.

488
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,360
-You're a parasite of society.
-Shut up!

489
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,240
You insulted me first.

490
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,040
You deserve it.

491
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,680
What happened to you, miss?

492
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,600
Don't go, miss.

493
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,720
Let go of me!

494
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't be shy.

495
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
-We're good people.
-Let go!

496
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,480
Let go!

497
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,880
-We're good people.
-Yeah.

498
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
-Let go of me!
-What are you doing?

499
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,600
Get lost.

500
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,680
What a busybody.

501
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
Why?

502
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,320
Why did Si do this to me?

503
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,440
Wipe it off.

504
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,280
When you feel like crying, do a handstand.

505
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,960
That way, your tears won't fall down.

506
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
Let me borrow this.

507
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,520
Eat the slippers!

508
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,640
Eat the slippers!

509
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!

510
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,120
-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!

511
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,920
-Eat the slippers!
-Eat the slippers!

512
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Eat the slippers!

513
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,560
Shancai,

514
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,320
come have breakfast.

515
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,800
Sweetheart, come and eat.

516
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
You've had two already.

517
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,680
That's for our daughter.

518
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,000
You have to buy me a new one.

519
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
It's none of my business.

520
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Go away!

521
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
This is what your family sells?

522
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,440
It doesn't look good at all.

523
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,920
Shut up!

524
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,400
We have limited capability,
but we have unlimited determination.

525
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm going to fight back!

526
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,120
Shancai, good morning.

527
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
Si!

528
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,920
Who wants to play cards with you?

529
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,480
I, Dong Shancai,
will not be bullied by anyone.
