00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 34

3
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
I shouldn't keep it from Daoming Si.

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,880
I should tell him.

5
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
Daoming Si.

6
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
-There's something I want to tell you.
-Wait.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't want to hear it.

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,520
Every time you talk to me seriously,
it's never good.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,400
It's very important.

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
-It's--
-I don't care. I'm not listening.

11
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
-No. I'm not listening.
-Hey.

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm not listening.

13
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,400
You graduated kindergarten 20 years ago.
Why are you acting like a three-year-old?

14
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,160
And you're acting like an old lady.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,840
We're alone here.
But you just keep frowning.

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,400
There you go again.

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,640
Always making me nervous with those words.

18
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,080
Who?

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,600
There's only the two of us here.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Hey.

21
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,040
How did you become a good kisser?

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
Didn't you say
you haven't dated anyone before?

23
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,680
All right.

24
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,200
Let me be honest with you.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
Back then,

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
I used to go out partying with Ximen.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,920
But it was a long time ago.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,080
Going out with Ximen and Meizuo
always involves lots of girls.

29
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,160
Those girls made a move on me.

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,680
I didn't mind.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
Of course.

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,800
Those were the things I did in the past.

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,880
I've stopped doing them now.

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
Really?

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,280
What's wrong?

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
That was a long time ago.

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,480
Are you jealous?

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
Don't be so full of yourself.

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,880
I don't care how many girls
you've flirted with.

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,680
You're jealous.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,200
-Yes!
-I told you I'm not.

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,000
It's good to be jealous.
What's wrong with that? Go ahead.

43
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
You're so childish.

44
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,800
You don't know what happened today.

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,200
I was followed by your bodyguards.

46
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,079
I was forced to hide,

47
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
and I couldn't go home.

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,440
Good thing Meizuo helped me.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
I was terrified.

50
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
You wouldn't even listen to me.

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,920
-My bodyguards?
-Yes.

52
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,160
-Why didn't you immediately tell me?
-What's the point of telling you?

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
This is something we should face together.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
Who would you tell if not me?

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,480
It would only complicate things
if I told you.

56
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Your mom would find out even earlier.

57
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
Even Meizuo felt that you'd make it worse.

58
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,120
I didn't want to tell you.

59
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,080
But I don't want to keep it from you.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
That's why I don't want to date in secret.

61
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Because I'm not aware of the decisions
you make without me.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
Hello?

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
Daoming Si.

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
Your bodyguards are looking for you.
I let them in.

65
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
Why did you turn off--

66
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Nobody knows me better than my mom.
So I'm the only one who can protect you.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,400
-But--
-Stop hesitating. Go to London with me.

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
How can we go to London now?

69
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
Maybe Qinghe and Xiaoyou's families
are already in trouble

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
before I could even leave.

71
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
I can't just leave them and run away.

72
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,200
This is the only door that's locked.
He should be in there.

73
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
What should we do?

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,480
We'll be exposed.
They'll get in here soon.

75
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,560
Are there any other exits?

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
If I'm not mistaken,
there's a window in the bathroom.

77
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Let's go. Hurry up!

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
Move faster.

79
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,840
The president said we're inefficient.
We can't even find Si.

80
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Break down the door.

81
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,240
May I ask what you're doing?

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,800
Washing my hair.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,640
Can't you see?

84
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
But why are you wearing your clothes?

85
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,520
I do it my way.

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,560
Do I need to explain to you
how I wash my hair?

87
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
You bunch of idiots.

88
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,360
How dare you interfere with my plans.

89
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,240
If this happens again,

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,400
I'll beat you up until you cry
to your mothers!

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,640
What happened?

92
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
Why are you so pissed?

93
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,800
Who made you angry?

94
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,680
She always treats her son like a criminal.

95
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,160
And I had to force Shancai
to run away without her shoes.

96
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,760
Were you doing naughty things?

97
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,840
Of course not.

98
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
What are you thinking, old woman?

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,520
As if my mom is not bad enough,
now you sound just like her.

100
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,880
My mom asked them to follow me.

101
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,960
They're on to Shancai too.

102
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,799
We almost got caught.

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
It seems

104
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
your mom is getting anxious.

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
She did the same things to Zhuang before.

106
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
I know.

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
But Mrs. Yu,

108
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,640
what happened to my sister's boyfriend?

109
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,400
He couldn't take your mom's threats
and ran away.

110
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
After that happened,

111
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,400
your mom locked Zhuang inside the house.

112
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,480
She refused to eat.

113
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,920
So I secretly let her go.

114
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,720
I hoped she could be happy from then on.

115
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,760
I never thought...

116
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,840
ONE MESSAGE RECEIVED

117
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Sorry. I won't see you again.

118
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,760
Let's break up.

119
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,720
That person wasn't
where they agreed to meet up.

120
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,520
Instead, he contacted your mom

121
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
to take Zhuang home.

122
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
Ms. Zhuang, let's go home.

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Where's that scum right now?

124
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
What a useless coward. He doesn't deserve her!

125
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
What worries me the most

126
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,280
was that Zhuang acted normal
during the day,

127
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,560
but always cried herself to sleep.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,360
She faked her smiles

129
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
and prepared for a wedding
that she didn't wish for.

130
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,480
She got married soon afterward.

131
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,160
And you already know what happened next.

132
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,320
Yes.

133
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,120
Who could take

134
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,120
my mom's methods?

135
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,480
Good thing it's all over now.

136
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't you think Zhuang is doing well now?

137
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Is she?

138
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Is it good to feel helpless?

139
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,960
Is it good to be

140
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
at the mercy of others?

141
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,960
If that's the definition of good,
isn't that really sad?

142
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
At that time, my sister
lost the reason to hold on.

143
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
She was betrayed by the man she loved.

144
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
Si.

145
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,200
Your sister

146
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,640
doesn't blame that person.

147
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,200
So if someday

148
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,040
Shancai gives up on me too,

149
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,760
should I also just accept it?

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,200
There were many times

151
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,400
when I thought I'd really lose her.

152
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,920
What are you doing?

153
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
How irresponsible.

154
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
If Shancai leaves you,

155
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,640
it's definitely not because of your mom.

156
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,640
It's because you gave up so easily.

157
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,680
Stop talking nonsense.

158
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,720
Facing so much restriction and misery
is not easy, you know?

159
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,440
Then you should hold on even more.

160
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,800
I did.

161
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
But...

162
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,880
what if I'm the only one holding on?

163
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,520
No matter how much I care for her

164
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,720
and love her,

165
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,360
does she feel the same?

166
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
What if Shancai...

167
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
What if Shancai gives up on me? Are you scared?

168
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
But this time,

169
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,400
I was really worried that you were scared.

170
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,640
Shancai's not confident

171
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,360
because you're not confident.

172
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Shancai's not at peace because she feels
that you're not at peace.

173
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
People's feelings

174
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,800
influence each other.

175
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,040
Nobody knows

176
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
what would happen in the future.

177
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,400
But the harder it gets,

178
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,920
the more you should support Shancai.

179
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,880
As long as your hearts
are closely connected,

180
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,000
you'd surely be able
to overcome this together.

181
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
I hope the both of you

182
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,960
can be happy.

183
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Did you get home safely?

184
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,480
DAOMING SI

185
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
YES

186
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,800
Did you get hurt?

187
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,360
Use voice message.
I want to hear your voice.

188
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm not hurt.

189
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm fine.

190
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,320
How about you?

191
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Daoming Si. Sorry.

192
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,480
I should've told you earlier. If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.

193
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,480
If you don't reply, I'll come see you now.

194
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm home. I didn't get hurt.

195
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,319
What are you doing?

196
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
I took care of what happened today.

197
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Don't think about it anymore.

198
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,520
Is my shoe with you?

199
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,240
Yes.

200
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
Then remember to bring it tomorrow.

201
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,440
And...

202
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
Thank you.

204
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,640
-Shancai.
-Yes?

205
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,320
I really can't do it without you.

206
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,720
I'm Wonder Woman. I'm strong.

207
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Shancai.

208
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,360
Sorry.

209
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
I almost forgot.

210
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,240
You, Ximen and Meizuo
planned to trick me yesterday.

211
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
It was all my fault.

212
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,200
I didn't know you'd care about me
so much that...

213
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,800
Sorry.

214
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
It's all right.

215
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,080
That's just how they are.

216
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,000
I couldn't say no to Ximen.

217
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,800
I told you it's all right.

218
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
Don't worry about it.

219
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,200
What's the matter?

220
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,440
Did something happen with Ximen yesterday?

221
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
What did he do to you?

222
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,200
Nothing. We just had some coffee.

223
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,960
-Just coffee?
-Yes.

224
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,040
All right.

225
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,800
But stay away from Ximen.
Don't let your guard down.

226
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,000
Why? I don't want to.

227
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,800
I want to get closer to him
and understand him better.

228
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
Wait.

229
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,920
Wait, Xiaoyou. Are you serious?

230
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,920
You really like Ximen?

231
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,080
He's a dangerous, frivolous,
and flirtatious guy.

232
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,280
Don't say that about him.

233
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,040
Sorry.

234
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
But are you serious?

235
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,320
Yes.

236
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,680
I never thought I'd have feelings for him.

237
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,560
But what can I do?

238
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,840
I feel like I'm liking him more and more.

239
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I'm so shocked.

240
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,760
This is the first time
I'm seeing Xiaoyou with that expression. While I'm busy worrying about my problems,

241
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,000
my best friend has fallen
for other F4 members.

242
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,040
I didn't even notice it.

243
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Xiaoyou.

244
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,600
I'm happy that you like someone.

245
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,080
But it's Ximen.

246
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,760
You'll get hurt because of him.

247
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,120
I see him with different girls
every single day.

248
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
He's a playboy, you know?

249
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,720
-I know.
-You know...

250
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
You know, yet...

251
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm not his type.

252
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,920
But I just happen to like him
and I can't even explain it.

253
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,120
I know I'll get hurt,

254
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,200
but I like being around him.

Why is it so hard?

257
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,680
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

258

Two, two, three, four,

Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

261
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Hello?

262
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
-Well...
-What?

263
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,680
I...

264
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,600
Did you bring my shoe?

265
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,720
I did.

266
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,120
Okay. Thank you.

267
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
-That's it. Bye.
-Hold on.

268
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,240
How do I give it to you?

269
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,400
Right. How would you give it to me?

270
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,040
Look on your right side.

271
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,960
Right side, stupid girl!

272
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,800
The next time you call me,
can you not dance first?

273
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,000
Because you look so funny.

274
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,200
Why are you here?

275
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,760
To return your shoe.

276
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,320
That's just an excuse.
Actually, I want to see you.

277
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,360
I can't stop Xiaoyou.

278
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,080
Because I know better than anyone

279
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,880
that you can't control your feelings.

280
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,920
This is the power of love.

281
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,600
Thank you.

282
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,680
Hey, can you put your phone down now?

283
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,400
So you're off work already?

284
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Yes. Xiaoyou just left.

285
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,240
Wait.

286
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,480
What if they found you here?

287
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
Don't worry.

288
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm in disguise.

289
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,560
You call that a disguise?

290
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Didn't you notice how much attention
you've attracted?

291
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,560
Stop talking nonsense. Where are we going?

292
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
So this is the place you said

293
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
we can talk quietly?

294
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,240
How would I know it'd turn out this way?

295
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,320
Or are you hinting something?

296
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,760
Yeah, right! You think too much.

297
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,760
All right.

298
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,160
What a shame.

299
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
Let's go somewhere else.

300
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,760
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

301
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,440
I want to tell you

302
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,160
that I didn't keep anything
from you on purpose.

303
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,200
Initially, I didn't want to mention

304
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,560
that I was followed by your bodyguards
because I meant well.

305
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,560
You did? I'm not sure about that.

306
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,960
-You don't believe me?
-That's not the issue.

307
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,560
Then what's the issue?

308
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,040
I love you.

309
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,520
Why did you suddenly say that?

310
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,320
How about you?
I want to know how you really feel.

311
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,680
-I told you I want to be with you.
-That's not enough.

312
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,520
How is it not enough?

313
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,800
I want it to be clearer.

314
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,360
I don't want vague answers.

315
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,720
I want to clearly confirm
that you really want to be with me.

316
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,040
Why is it still vague to you?

317
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,920
Which part of it do you not understand?

318
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm not sure what the fuss is about.

319
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,640
You never told me that you love me.

320
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,840
I feel very uncertain.

321
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,520
Like you'd leave me anytime.

322
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
I've been waiting all this time.

323
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
But it seems like
you don't plan to say it.

324
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
Do you really have to force me
to tell you this?

325
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,440
How stupid can you get?

326
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Turns out Daoming Si wants me
to tell him clearly.

327
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,560
He thinks my answers are vague.

328
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,240
He wants everything to be clear.

329
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,800
That's really nice.

330
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,200
I admire you.

331
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
There you go again.

332
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,280
You get on my nerves
every time you speak nonsense.

333
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
Hello? What is it?

334
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
It's just a simple line.

335
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,440
"I love you."

336
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,280
Why do I always mess it up
when the timing is right?

337
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Okay, no problem.

338
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
Shancai?

339
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,880
All right. Cut the crap.

340
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,880
Bye.

341
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,920
Who was it? Why did you mention my name?

342
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
Ximen said he'll throw
a National Tea Tasting Party

343
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,880
at his house.

344
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,200
You're invited.

345
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,000
National Tea Tasting Party?

346
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,840
Your friend is invited as well.

347
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,360
Xiaoyou?

348
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,200
Will Ximen be there?

349
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,000
The party is at his house.
What do you expect?

350
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,520
So? Are you going or not?

351
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,160
Of course!

352
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
But...

353
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,960
let's go separately.

354
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
Haven't we already agreed?

355
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,280
When did you two become familiar
with the Way of Tea?

356
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,640
We were exposed to it
since we were little.

357
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,760
I see.

358
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,920
What do you think about the tea culture?

359
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
Because of my good friend, Ximen,

360
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,880
I can call myself a tea expert.

361
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
Whether it's green tea, black tea,
semi-fermented tea, or dark tea,

362
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,080
I know them well.

363
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
What kind of tea do you personally like?

364
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,880
Assam black tea because it's quite unique.

365
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,200
It has a rich and strong taste.
Its aroma is very pure.

366
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,680
You can enjoy it with milk.

367
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,800
So I think

368
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,160
it's quite special to drink that at home.

369
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,040
-I think everyone should try it.
-Any other recommendations?

370
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
Shancai, you're here.

371
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,560
You're so late. We're all waiting for you.

372
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,960
Where are the others?

373
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,440
They changed into cheongsams.
Aren't you going to change too?

374
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,640
Cheongsam?

375
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,040
Is that necessary?
I've never worn one before.

376
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,640
Maybe because green tea is lighter?

377
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,480
The lightness is not the problem. It's...

378
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,960
If you don't know how to wear it,
ask the expert.

379
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,400
Expert?

380
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,280
He's inside.

381
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,760
I don't think I can do it.

382
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,920
It's all right. Leave it to me.

383
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,840
Don't move! Ximen, stop!

384
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,080
You're here.

385
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,320
What are you doing?

386
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,520
I was helping her put it on.

387
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,400
Did it look like
I'm unbuttoning her dress?

388
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
What do you think?

389
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,920
Anyone who sees this will think you're...

390
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,320
Shancai, you're really funny.

391
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,960
I'm serious.

392
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,000
Why did she need your help
to button her up?

393
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,520
The cheongsam requires a pair
of patient and skillful hands.

394
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,600
In tea ceremonies,
I'd help ladies in their preparations,

395
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,480
so that they'll look their best.

396
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,640
Shancai.

397
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,240
I don't look good
in this cheongsam, right?

398
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
Nonsense.

399
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,240
I prepared this cheongsam just for you.

400
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,680
It fits you well.

401
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,120
But isn't cheongsam usually worn
by women with very good figures?

402
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,600
My figure doesn't compliment
this cheongsam.

403
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,840
The only problem is your confidence.

404
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,720
Lack of confidence decreases your charm.

405
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
The cheongsam is not for just
one type of woman.

406
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,440
Every woman who wears it
has their own charms.

407
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
So you're the cheongsam expert
they were referring to?

408
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Of course. Don't I look like it?

409
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,920
What?

410
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,640
You should go change too.

411
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,480
But experts can also make mistakes

412
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,200
since the cheongsam

413
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,440
cannot be worn by frogs.

414
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,880
You... Ximen.

415
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,240
Do you usually hold such gatherings?

416
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,840
After graduation,
I rarely hold it like I used to.

417
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,680
However, your waist is really big.

418
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,160
What do you want me to do?
I'm a frog with a big waist. So what?

419
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
Don't worry. Si likes you no matter what.

420
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Ximen.

421
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
Can you promise me one thing?

422
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,920
What is it?

423
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
I want to talk

424
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,840
-about you and Xiaoyou--
-If we're alone too long,

425
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,960
Si won't be happy about it.

426
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Why would he be unhappy?

427
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,080
Hey.

428
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,400
Don't I look handsome?

429
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,880
You look like a waiter in Hengdian.

430
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
How could you say that?

431
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,600
You look like you sell pork buns
in tea houses.

432
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,240
Si, aren't you getting Shancai a drink?

433
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
Can't she get it herself?

434
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Fine feathers make you look fine.

435
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,920
Fine feathers make fine birds.

436
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,120
Did you purposely say it wrong?

437
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
I was complimenting you.

438
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,800
Stupid girl. Don't you get it?

439
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,400
I look hideous in cheongsam.
That's not funny at all.

440
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,240
Then you don't have a sense of humor.

441
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,760
Stop staring, or I'll kill you.

442
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,880
You two are so sweet.

443
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm so jealous.

444
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,920
What? We're not.

445
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,560
Gotcha.

446
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,600
Hey, Li Zhen, you too...

447
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,280
Fight some more.

448
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,560
Don't be ridiculous.

449
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,199
It's fun to see Si and Shancai argue.

450
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,440
That's right. It's not any fun otherwise.

451
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,760
All right. We're all here.
Let's start the party!

452
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,560
Yes!

453
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,159
Yes!

454
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,720
Come on. Two, three.

455
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Come on.

456
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,120
Drink.

457
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,960
All right.

458
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,440
-Okay. Again.
-Okay. Again.

459
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
Drink.

460
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,360
-Drink.
-No. Another round.

461
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,240
-Why do I always lose?
-Drink. -You drank all these.
-Yes.

462
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,120
-You're not drinking?
-That's enough.

463
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,040
You drank too much.

464
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,920
Daoming Si.

465
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,760
-What should we do?
-About what?

466
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
Everyone's worried about us.

467
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,120
They're so sincere.

468
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,640
Yet I've been keeping things from them.

469
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,600
Sorry.

470
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,200
I'm too weak.

471
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,160
Daoming Si should know
that this relationship needs commitment.

472
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,600
I should have made it clear to him
long ago, but I never had the chance.

473
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,360
Should I do it now?

474
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,680
I...

475
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,640
All this time,

476
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,600
I...

477
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,000
I love you.

478
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,280
I didn't say that, right?

479
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,080
I know.

480
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,880
Ximen.

481
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,560
I love you.

482
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Thank you.

483
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,440
I love you too.

484
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,920
Ximen is going to break Xiaoyou's heart.

485
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,560
I'm serious.

486
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,000
I know.

487
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,600
Girls who make serious confessions
are beautiful.

488
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,840
You were quite beautiful earlier.

489
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,280
What is he talking about?

490
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,760
Shut up. But why

491
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,720
are you saying this?

492
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,880
What do you want?

493
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,240
To go out on a date,

494
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,520
hug, or kiss?

495
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,960
Xiaoyou.

496
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,320
I think you've misunderstood.

497
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm a good person,

498
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,240
but not a good man.

499
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,760
You should find a good man to protect you.

500
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,320
All right?

501
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,760
Why do you always pretend to act
like a bad guy in front of me?

502
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,600
-Why do you live this way?
-Xiaoyou.

503
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,840
Self-righteous girls

504
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,320
are a turn-off.

505
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,960
That guy is really crazy this time.

506
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,400
Xiaoyou.

507
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,240
Sorry.

508
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,400
I overheard you earlier.

509
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,680
It's so embarrassing.
You saw what happened.

510
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,120
I slapped Ximen earlier.

511
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
Turns out hitting someone

512
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,240
also hurts your own hand.

513
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,560
I have to do better.

514
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,080
What are you trying to say?

515
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,800
I think I understand Ximen more now.

516
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,280
I'll do better next time.

517
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,880
But didn't you get rejected earlier?

518
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,360
Shancai.

519
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,440
I hope you'll cheer for me.

520
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,120
Please.

521
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,200
You can do it.

522
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,480
It's a good thing.
I think Ximen's very honest.

523
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Says who?

524
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,600
I usually can't tell
whether he's telling the truth or not.

525
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,600
He can reject her all he wants,
but why say such outrageous things?

526
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,760
He didn't flirt or date that girl first.

527
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,200
He rejected her directly.

528
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,200
If I didn't see it for myself,
I wouldn't believe it.

529
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,720
So you mean I should even thank him?

530
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,120
Tell your friend to give up.

531
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,000
-Or else, she'll get hurt.
-Don't jinx it.

532
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
It's true.

533
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
It's not possible for her and Ximen.

534
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,920
She's going to be more upset. Aren't you worried for the same reason?

535
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,320
Hey.

536
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,000
Don't just think about other people.

537
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,840
Think about us too.

538
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,600
How long will we go on like this?

539
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,880
How long do I have to wait

540
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,520
for you to tell me what you truly feel?

541
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,680
Just...

542
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,720
wait a bit more.

543
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,320
Are you still the same person?

544
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,520
Lately, I feel

545
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,760
that you're not the Shancai
I've always liked anymore.

546
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,080
-It's not that easy.
-It is!

547
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,640
No.

548
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,520
If we tell everyone
about our relationship,

549
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,080
the lives of people around us
would change.

550
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
You won't understand.

551
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,000
There you go again.

552
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,880
You're always like this.

553
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,760
I don't understand.

554
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,880
So you do?

555
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,640
Then protect them on your own.

556
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,080
He's right.

557
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,160
This is not like me at all.

558
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,680
I know that better than anyone.

559
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,840
But...

560
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,880
Si, where are you going?

561
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
-Home.
-Home?

562
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,640
What?

563
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,680
Home? Who's going home?

564
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,280
It's late. I should get going too.

565
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,000
It's too late. It might be dangerous.

566
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,840
Just stay here.

567
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,840
Yes, just stay here.

568
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,400
We can have a sleepover tonight.

569
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,200
A sleepover.

570
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,600
-Si, stay here tonight too.
-No.

571
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,360
What happened?

572
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,160
Why do you suddenly want to go home?

573
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,240
-Nothing happened.
-I'm sure something did.

574
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,320
Shancai, what's going on with you two?

575
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,400
Why are you two so confused?

576
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,200
Daoming Si.

577
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,360
I love you.

578
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Listen, everyone.

579
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,440
Daoming Si and I

580
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,400
have been dating for a while now.

581
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,640
Sorry that we kept it from you.

582
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,960
It's not strange that you're dating,

583
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,080
but did you just confess your feelings?

584
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes.

585
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
Si, why are you still standing there?
Shancai confessed her feelings.

586
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Aren't you going to do anything?

587
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,120
I want to live like myself.

588
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,320
I finally said it.

589
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,040
Around the arms tightly holding me,

590
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
I can hear everyone's cheers.

591
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,680
This moment

592
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,640
is mine.

593
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,560
I cannot explain

594
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,040
how amazing it feels right now.
