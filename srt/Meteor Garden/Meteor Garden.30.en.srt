A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 30

3
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Miss Caina.

4
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,560
How are you doing?

5
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,640
I'm doing fine.

6
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,240
Actually...

7
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,880
Stop if you're not fine.

8
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Here.

9
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
I'll order a cocktail for you today.

10
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Wei Xun.

11
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,280
I want to order

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
"Goodbye Old Place."

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520
I want it sour, sweet, bitter and spicy.

14
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,040
Everything in it. One for each of us.

15
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
All right.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,960
"Goodbye Old Place"?

17
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
What does that mean?

18
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,440
Are we not coming here again?

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
No, we're not.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Caina.

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Do you remember what I told you?

22
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Meeting me

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
is the beginning of your happiness.

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,400
Today,

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,440
I want to officially start this happiness.

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,480
If you're not coming back,

27
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,680
it'd be

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
my treat today.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,240
All right. Cheers.

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,840
Here.

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
The taste is horrible.

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,640
If we had this the first time, maybe we wouldn't have met
the second time.

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,840
Sometimes,

34
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,960
we cannot tell the outcome beforehand.

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Because if we did,

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,680
then we'd have no courage to do it.

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,520
But if we don't,

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
how would we know the outcome?

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Since we got to know each other,

40
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,320
this is the first time

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,320
you didn't get drunk
after having one glass.

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,360
Because you said

43
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,040
we won't go to that old place again.

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
I don't want to face you
in a confused state.

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Love is confusing.

46
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,920
I don't want to be too sober today.

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
Or else, I won't be able

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
to tell you what I want. You have something to tell me?

49
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
-What a coincidence. I--
-Don't say it yet.

50
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,400
Follow me.

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,640
Today will also be

52
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
a very,

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,040
very good day.

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,160
Why are we in my backyard?

55
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
I have a gift for you.

56
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,840
What?

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,920
A gift for me again?

58
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,840
Let's keep walking. You'll see it.

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Meizuo, wait.

60
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,280
Why are you so nice to me?

61
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
Because you're worth it.

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm not as perfect as you think.

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I never thought that you are.

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
Because you're you,

65
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,640
you deserve to be loved.

66
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,960
Just keep walking

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,680
and you'll see

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,160
where your happiness lies.

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
No, Meizuo.

70
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
I really can't.

71
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm moved by everything you do.

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,200
But if I go forward,

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,680
I'd really hurt you.

74
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
You won't.

75
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Every single day will be precious.

76
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Every single day,

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,160
I'd make you smile.

78
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,320
This is my promise to you.

79
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,960
Trust me.

80
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
Follow me.

81
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,200
This is...

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
This is Ye Mingchuan's gift for you.

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,760
He said

84
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
what you wanted

85
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,720
is not an ordinary house.

86
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,320
You wanted a dream.

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,480
He spent all his time with Ding Qi

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
so that he can give you this surprise

89
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
on your birthday.

90
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,400
He said this would make you really happy.

91
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,280
You've always been

92
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
his most cherished person.

93
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm really such a bad person.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,800
Caina.

95
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,480
You should be honest with yourself.

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,200
Even though you've been resisting it,

97
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
but you've always loved

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Ye Mingchuan.

99
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Yes.

100
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
I wasn't confident.

101
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
I was insecure.

102
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
It's all my fault.

103
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm a fool who doesn't know how to love.

104
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
Meizuo.

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,240
Why are you telling me this?

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,120
Don't you hate him?

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I do.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,720
But

109
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,480
I like you.

110
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
I always thought that...

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,640
to make someone fall in love with you,

112
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
you have to make her smile.

113
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,679
But I've learned

114
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,480
that when you really love someone,

115
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
you'd unconsciously

116
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,240
cry because of her.

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,200
Meizuo.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,120
You've done so much for me.

119
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,840
I don't want you to feel miserable.

120
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,520
Don't worry.

121
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,920
Youngsters like us fall in love

122
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
and move on.

123
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
We're honest with how we feel.

124
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
But that guy

125
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,840
really likes you.

126
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
He just couldn't tell you.

127
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
Stop wasting time.

128
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
When he leaves,

129
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,440
you might not see him anymore.

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,560
Caina.

131
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
This tree house is here.

132
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
But Mr. Coconut is leaving.

133
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,400
Aren't you going after him?

134
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
Thank you, Meizuo.

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Thank you.

136
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
But before I go,

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,080
I hope you can give something to her.

138
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,400
TREE HOUSE DESIGN

139
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
I spent a lot of time preparing
this tree house for her.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
It's located in her backyard.

141
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
She told me

142
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,920
that she doesn't like to stay
in a house like a cage.

143
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,080
She likes tree houses.

144
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,080
When I'm in the house,

145
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm a like a bird

146
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,200
in a cage.

147
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,040
Is that so?

148
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
You feel that way too?

149
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,880
That's how I've always felt.

150
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,120
It turns out I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
I really like the tree houses
in fairy tales.

152
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,840
I know this is insignificant.

153
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Initially,

154
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I wanted to give it to her as a surprise.

155
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,800
The two must overlap.

156
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,160
The living room in front,
bedroom at the back.

157
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,440
-Overlap.
-Yes.

158
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,840
Then a French window in the middle.

159
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
The living room in front,
bedroom at the back.

160
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
This tree here...

161
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,040
It has an oval shape.

162
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,400
It's a tree house with two eggs
overlapping together.

163
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,240
-Overlapping together.
-Yes.

164
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,520
Please give this to her on my behalf.

165
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,680
I hope you can always make her happy.

166
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Where is he?

167
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
He already left.

168
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,240
He left?

169
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,320
Where did he go?

170
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,160
He confirmed his next project.

171
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,760
He went to the States.

172
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,240
How can you leave?

173
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
You're leaving
without finishing the renovation.

174
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
If my dad doesn't like it,

175
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,800
I have to go back to the States.

176
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
But I want to stay in Shanghai.

177
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,240
How can you be so irresponsible?

178
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm not leaving.

179
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,920
But why are you here at the airport?

180
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,160
I'm waiting for someone

181
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
to travel with me.

182
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
How did you know I'd be here?

183
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
I don't know.

184
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,320
Just like before.

185
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,520
I thought you liked me,
but you disappeared.

186
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,840
I really don't know what you'll do.

187
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,160
I'm just doing whatever I can.

188
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,600
Then I can only wait.

189
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,400
How long will you keep waiting for me?

190
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,680
Until that one day

191
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,880
you'll feel that being with me

192
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,920
would make you happy.

193
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Today is the day. It has been a while.

194
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Caina.

195
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,840
Hi, it has been a while.

196
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,400
Can you do it?

197
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,119
Maybe I should just call the plumber.

198
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,000
Thanks.

199
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,599
You must check all the pipes
in this house.

200
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,880
It's raining so heavily. Go inside.

201
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,040
I'll be done soon. Go back inside.

202
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,640
Did you make it?

203
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,320
Hello.

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Are you on a date? I have a bet with Lei.

205
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,000
I said you're at a concert.

206
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,920
Lei said you're at a bookstore.

207
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,480
What's the matter?

208
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Is it going well?

209
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,760
Yes.

210
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,360
We...

211
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,040
ended it.

212
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,320
Are you feeling okay?

213
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,240
How come?

214
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm too cool

215
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,960
to be understood

216
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
by regular people.

217
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,400
That's great.

218
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
I met a lot of beautiful girls
in my group report recently.

219
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,280
I was worried I have no one
to share them with.

220
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,840
We have a group discussion tomorrow.
Don't be late.

221
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
All right.

222
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
I'll be there.

223
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,680
It's been a few days.
Haven't you recovered?

224
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,600
Here.

225
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is for you.

226
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,400
Seven days.

227
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,000
In a blink of an eye,

228
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,200
it's been seven days
since Caina and Ye Mingchuan left.

229
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,360
And I've made a personal record.

230
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,600
I still couldn't move on after seven days.

231
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
From the perspective of psychology,

232
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
you will go through four stages

233
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,280
after you got dumped.

234
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,880
Shock, conflict, anger

235
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
and acceptance.

236
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,840
But a heartless person like you
should already be in the acceptance stage.

237
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,600
So much for acceptance!

238
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,120
I'm shocked, conflicted and pissed.

239
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
Why did I accept a heartless person
like you as my friend?

240
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,520
How could you laugh at my handsome face?

241
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,800
That's rude.

242
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,200
Because the dark circles around your eyes

243
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,240
exude the beauty and sadness
of a broken heart.

244
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Hey, Lei.

245
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Didn't you bring Shancai back
from the village?

246
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,560
Why didn't you bring her to see Si?

247
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Si should be the one to ask me
where Shancai is.

248
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,640
You don't need to overreact.

249
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,360
Hey, Si.

250
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
I wasn't overreacting.

251
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,000
Si, Shan--

252
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,080
Shanshan is late.

253
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
Why are you late?

254
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,760
I didn't have class any earlier.

255
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
All right. Let's begin.

256
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,480
Hey.

257
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,600
-I'll take the attendance.
-Tell me. When will that guy move on?

258
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,040
-Feng Meizuo.
-Present.

259
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,600
-Yan Qian.
-Present.

260
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
-Lian Zuo.
-Present.

261
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,600
-Liu Panpan.
-Present.

262
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,880
-Zheng Han.
-Present.

263
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,920
-Cao Zhen.
-Present. -Liu Zhengbo.
-Present.

264
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,880
Shancai, you were gone for two weeks.
What did the teachers say?

265
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,920
I apologized to them and filed my leave.
They made an exception this time.

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
But the finals are coming up.

267
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,000
-I'm afraid I couldn't catch up.
-It'll be all right.

268
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,440
I can lend you my notes.

269
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,600
You're amazing.

270
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
I feel so stupid for always asking you.

271
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,360
You can ask me if you have any questions.

272
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,320
You'll be fine.

273
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,440
However,
a lot of things happened recently.

274
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,960
Don't think too much.

275
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,400
Just move on.

276
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,000
You have a new future ahead of you.

277
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,520
Shancai.

278
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
Did I see Shancai earlier?

279
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
If it wasn't her,

280
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,760
then I might be hallucinating too.

281
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
Shancai, why are you hiding here?

282
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
It's nothing.

283
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,120
Is it because of Daoming Si?

284
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Maybe.

285
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,680
I don't want to face him yet.

286
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,560
Shancai,

287
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,280
if you want to draw the line
with Daoming Si,

288
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,440
then tell him directly.

289
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
You can't hide all the time.

290
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

291
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
We should go to class.

292
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,200
Why did you ask me to come here?

293
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,920
Si.

294
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
What do you plan to do with Shancai?

295
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,120
I've nothing to do with her anymore.

296
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,320
Isn't that obvious?

297
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,280
Shancai's feelings,

298
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,840
her life

299
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
and her future

300
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,080
have nothing to do with you anymore? How many times do I need to say it?

301
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,960
It's over between us.

302
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,760
Do you really believe that?

303
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Lei,

304
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,320
since when are you interested
in other people's business?

305
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,120
All right.

306
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Because it's Shancai, right?

307
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,320
That's why you're so interested.

308
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
I told Ximen and Meizuo before
that I won't get

309
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,240
in between you and Shancai,

310
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,240
unless you have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

311
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll ask you one last time.

312
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,680
Do you want to be with Shancai?

313
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Stop talking nonsense.

314
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,560
I don't want to repeat
what I already said.

315
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
All right.

316
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,600
Then let me officially tell you.

317
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm pursuing Shancai.

318
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,960
Do whatever you want.

319
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,600
Listen to me carefully.

320
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,520
I love Shancai.

321
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,080
I've always felt
that we're more than friends.

322
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
I backed off before

323
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
and wished you both well.

324
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,120
Now I'm not sure
whether I've done the right thing.

325
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,720
Lei.

326
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,040
These words you're saying

327
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
are very hard for me to take.

328
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,680
The words "backing off"
piss you off, right?

329
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,120
Then let me say it again

330
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,640
This time, I want to compete
with you in pursuing Shancai.

331
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
I don't want to see her cry
because of you.

332
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,440
If you've already given up on her,

333
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,600
then please wish me well,

334
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
just like what I did before.

335
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,600
Are you threatening me?

336
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,360
Or are you purposely challenging me?

337
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,040
You don't have to tell me what you'll do.

338
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,640
There's no need for that.

339
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,200
Si.

340
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,160
Even if it's not necessary,
I still think I should tell you.

341
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,920
I value F4's friendship.

342
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,400
So please wish me well.

343
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,960
Or would you rather have a fight with me?

344
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Then let's fight.

345
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,640
Let me tell you again.

346
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,760
You don't have to tell me
what you want to do.

347
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,680
Do whatever you want.

348
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Si!

349
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,000
Let me take care of Shancai.

350
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Your mom said

351
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,080
that if I continue seeing you,

352
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,960
she'll make Qinghe and Xiaoyou's
dads lose their jobs.

353
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,480
I'll talk to her now.

354
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,280
Don't!

355
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
I've already decided.

356
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,560
I don't want to have anything to do
with the Daoming family.

357
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,000
I've decided not to contact you.

358
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,680
I can't accept it.

359
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,720
Shancai.

360
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,440
Shancai.

361
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,760
Are you all right?

362
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm all right.

363
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,040
I eat and sleep well.
I'm full of energy and my mind is clear.

364
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Stop pretending.

365
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,920
Don't give up on Daoming Si.

366
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,520
Look at you.

367
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,920
You seem distracted.

368
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm really worried about you.

369
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,320
I've really thought
things through this time.

370
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,840
Why?

371
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,040
Can't two people who love each other
be together against all odds?

372
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
It's not that easy.

373
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,120
If it's because of me, don't worry.

374
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,600
I can take care of myself.

375
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,440
It's not just because of you.

376
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,200
Maybe I'm just exhausted.

377
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,040
When I was with him,

378
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,120
it felt like things always went wrong.

379
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,880
Can you really forget him?

380
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,160
How do I put it?

381
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,240
There were many times

382
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,840
when I realized I fell in love with him.

383
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,080
Then, get back together.

384
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Falling in love is the best gift
in this world.

385
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,360
Many people want to, but they can't.

386
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
But when I first knew him,

387
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,600
I definitely, completely

388
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,080
didn't like him at all.

389
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
-I even hated him.
-That was before.

390
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,720
Then I'll go back to the way it was.

391
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
I definitely, completely
don't like him at all!

392
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
Now I'm back to square one.

393
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,760
As if nothing happened.

394
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,920
-What are you doing?
-I want to tell you something. Follow me.

395
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,080
Let go of me.

396
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
Don't you have something to tell me?

397
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,560
If you have nothing to say,
then I'll leave.

398
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,360
Can't you stay with me for a while?

399
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,400
Do you hate it when I'm around?

400
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,920
That's not what I meant.

401
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
You suddenly disappeared

402
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,640
and hid in the fishing village
to sell squid. What were you thinking?

403
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,680
The fishing village was nice.
It was relaxing there.

404
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,040
I had squid and went
to the beach every day.

405
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,400
It was like a vacation.

406
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,040
-You don't know how happy--
-Shancai.

407
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
You're so disappointing.

408
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,600
Every time I want to have a serious talk,

409
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,920
you either talk nonsense

410
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,240
or hide or sleep.

411
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
Do you know how to be honest?

412
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,680
Daoming Si.

413
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,520
-It's not that I don't know--
-If you can honestly face your feelings,

414
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't need to be like a clown
getting played by you!

415
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,440
I can't only think about my own happiness

416
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,760
and not care about others.

417
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,320
If Qinghe and Xiaoyou were not in trouble,

418
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I wouldn't have had to go
to the fishing village.

419
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,400
That's just an excuse.

420
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,560
You always have a lot of excuses!

421
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,280
I think I really am that stupid.

422
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,760
I've had enough!

423
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,560
Do you think I want

424
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
to wander around

425
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,840
and struggle like this?

426
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,120
Daoming Si.

427
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,360
-Actually, I--
-Don't cry.

428
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,880
Even if you cry,

429
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,880
I won't do anything for you anymore.

430
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
Also,

431
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,719
you don't need to run away

432
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
when you see me in school anymore.

433
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,920
We have nothing to do
with each other anymore.

434
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,760
Just like strangers.

435
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Let's end it today.

436
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,639
Goodbye.

437
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,560
Daoming Si! Since that's the case...

438
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,280
Here's the meteor necklace

439
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,880
you gave me.

440
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,240
Daoming Si, I like you.

441
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,360
I really like you.

442
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,280
There was a moment earlier

443
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,320
when I almost told you that.

444
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
I almost destroyed my friends' families.

445
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,320
I almost threw away my pride
and self-respect!

446
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
I almost threw everything away
and confessed to you.

447
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,760
I really...

448
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,640
almost confessed my feelings.

449
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,520
Shancai, what are you doing?

450
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,400
Shancai, come up here.

451
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,240
Lei.

452
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm begging you. Help me find it.

453
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,040
Please come here and help me
find it, okay?

454
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
What are you looking for?

455
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,880
Stop it.

456
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,360
Even if it's something very meaningful,
it's gone now.

457
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,960
No! I want to find it!

458
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,920
I have to find it!

459
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
Why can't I find it?

460
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,760
I want to find it!

461
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,480
Where is it?

462
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,440
Is this the one?

463
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,680
Is this what you're looking for?

464
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,040
Now, I know how it feels like
to love someone.

465
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,640
Whatever you do,

466
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,160
you can't turn away from your feelings.

467
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,800
You can't stop yourself from loving him.

468
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,800
Si, why are you drinking so much?

469
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,080
What's wrong?

470
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,520
I'm happy. Can't I drink to celebrate?

471
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,480
Celebrate?

472
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,200
What are you celebrating?

473
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,200
To celebrate that Lei and Shancai

474
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,760
are officially dating.

475
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,120
How is that possible?

476
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,440
Are you drunk?

477
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,920
No.

478
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm very sober.

479
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,280
After all this time,

480
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,200
I'm the most sober now.

481
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,640
How could that happen?

482
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,840
Has Lei already decided?

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,920
What's your plan?

484
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,440
What do you mean?

485
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,360
I wish them well, of course.

486
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,360
Don't you think this is great?

487
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,200
Si, cut it out.

488
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,960
How can you not care at all?

489
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,040
Do you want to kick Lei
out of F4 like before?

490
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,520
No. Why would I do that?

491
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,600
Lei said

492
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,160
I should wish him well,

493
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,160
just like he did before.

494
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,760
Si, this is not you.

495
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,440
Listen carefully.

496
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,120
If you really give her up this time,

497
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,400
you might not have a chance anymore.

498
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,480
And that's Lei.

499
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,240
It'll be more complicated now.

500
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,600
If you regret it later,
you'll lose both friendship and love.

501
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Have you thought it out?

502
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,520
Shancai and I are done.

503
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,040
Are you saying you don't care
who Shancai will be seeing?

504
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Of course!

505
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,480
Come on. Let's toast for Lei!

506
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Si, you...

507
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,400
Even if it's not necessary,
I still think I should tell you.

508
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,560
I value F4's friendship.

509
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,200
So please wish me well.

510
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,760
Or would you rather have a fight with me?

511
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Then let's fight.

512
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,080
Let me tell you again.

513
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,320
You don't have to tell me
what you want to do.

514
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,160
Do whatever you want.

515
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,720
Si.

516
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,400
Let me take care of Shancai.

517
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,920
Don't you think
they're actually quite a match?

518
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,600
A stupid girl...

519
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,600
and a sleepyhead who sleeps all the time.

520
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,840
Si.
