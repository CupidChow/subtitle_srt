A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 16

3
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,040
Ximen, you'll like this wine.

4
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I didn't expect such a place
to have an amazing cabin

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
and wine cellar here. What a surprise.

6
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,600
This one has a strong fruity flavor.

7
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
Am I describing it correctly?

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
You've got talent.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
This is called a Merlot.

10
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Fruity and sweet.

11
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,640
It tastes good, right?

12
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,200
Yes, it's good.

13
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,840
Do you want to try this?

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
It's drier. It's very dry.

15
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,480
And a little sour.

16
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
I still prefer the previous one.
It's sweet.

17
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,080
This one is a smoked wine.

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
The longer it ages, the stronger the taste.

19
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Are there people
that actually like this wine?

20
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Plenty of people.

21
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,200
Everyone has different tastes
and preferences.

22
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,200
For Meizuo, he likes aged wine.

23
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Like brandy.

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
The longer it is stored,

25
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,920
the more fragrant it becomes.

26
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,720
Lei likes newer wine.

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
Si prefers malt wine.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,440
Each person chooses something

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
based on their preferences.

30
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,680
How about you? What kind do you like?

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
I like all kinds.

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
Every wine has its own charm.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
So have you tried all the wine
in this cellar?

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,640
This cellar belongs to Si,

35
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,480
but the one who manages it is Ximen.

36
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
You shouldn't drink that.

37
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,680
It doesn't suit you.

38
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,960
I haven't tried it yet.
How would you know?

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,320
All right. Don't get drunk though.

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,600
It's dinner time. Let's head up.

41
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
Should we bring these two bottles?

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,560
Yes, I think so.

43
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,520
This useless teammate.
He's already a burden.

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
Now he's gone missing?

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,680
Where are they?

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,360
Where's Shancai?

47
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Hey, Lei.

48
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,880
Where were you? Have you seen Shancai?

49
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,560
I was out looking for Shancai.
Hasn't she come back?

50
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,800
What do you mean?

51
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
Shancai said Xiaoyou went
for a night stroll.

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,680
She went looking for her.

53
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Xiaoyou.

54
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,120
I'll recommend some special wine to you
to pair with tonight's dinner.

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,480
Xiaoyou?

56
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,480
You are Xiaoyou?

57
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,120
Aren't you out for a night stroll?

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
A night stroll? No.

59
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,080
I was at the wine cellar
with Ximen and Meizuo.

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,320
But Shancai went to look for you.

61
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
There's a blizzard outside.

62
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
She isn't--

63
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,680
What exactly happened?

64
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,160
Someone told Shancai
that you went for a night stroll.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,160
That's impossible.

66
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,840
Have you seen the weather?
Nobody should be out there.

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
Xiaoyou!

68
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,920
Xiaoyou!

69
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,360
Xiaoyou!

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,920
Xiaoyou!

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Xiaoyou!

72
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Xiaoyou!

73
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,640
Where are you?

74
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Xiaoyou.

75
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Xiaoyou!

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
That hurts.

77
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,440
This won't work. I should go back.

78
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
I need help finding Xiaoyou.

79
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,520
But the cabin is...

80
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,039
How did this happen?

81
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
I hope nothing bad happens to Shancai.

82
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,320
At the time,

83
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,919
I really thought she went out
to see the night sky.

84
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,400
Yeah.

85
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,280
We really did see Xiaoyou
go out the front door.

86
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
-That's why--
-I never went out.

87
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
The thing is

88
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
I didn't ask Shancai to go.

89
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,240
But she herself--

90
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
Lei.

91
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
You shouldn't do that.

92
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,960
What's a glass of wine
compared to Shancai's life?

93
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
Yes.

94
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
But I don't think

95
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
anything would happen to Shancai.

96
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,960
It's minus 20 degrees outside.

97
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,600
She's been out there
for more than two hours.

98
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,840
If she got stuck in the blizzard,
she'd be dead.

99
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,440
You'd better pray that Si finds her.

100
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,360
Otherwise, you'll be murderers.

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,760
We...

102
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,000
We didn't do it on purpose.

103
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
Still not admitting your mistake?

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
How shameless.

105
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,000
It's my fault.

106
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,520
If something happens to Shancai,

107
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,560
what am I going to do?

108
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,400
She will be fine.

109
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,360
I'm going to call the SAR team.

110
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,800
We need help.

111
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
Dong Shancai! Shancai!

112
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,600
Shancai!

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Shancai.

114
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
Shancai! Shancai!

115
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,240
Shancai!

116
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,640
Who would've thought I'd die today.

117
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,600
I left the house in such good spirits
this morning.

118
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,760
I was so eager.

119
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,320
How ironic.

120
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,640
I don't want to die here.

121
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,080
I still have so many things I want to do.

122
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
I still have to graduate.

123
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,280
I want to graduate with my friends
from Mingde University.

124
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,400
Dad and Mom will be proud

125
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
that I graduated.

126
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
They'll be smiling from ear to ear.

127
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,400
We'll celebrate together.

128
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,800
Sometimes,

129
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,200
I'll indulge a little.

130
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
I'll go on a vacation overseas
with my friends.

131
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
Lastly,

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,680
I'll meet a man I love dearly

133
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,240
and marry him.

134
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,800
It will not be

135
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
very big or expensive,

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,240
but a beautiful wedding.

137
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,280
I'll spend the rest of my life
with him in happiness.

138
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,160
The groom is a man I love.

139
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
But...

140
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,840
why can't I see his face clearly?

141
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,600
Dong Shancai!

142
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,160
Where are you?

143
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
Hey!

144
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,400
Xiaoyou never left the cabin.

145
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,840
Dong Shancai!

146
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Dong Shancai!

147
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,920
Shancai. Shancai.

148
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,960
Shancai! Hey.

149
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
Hey, Shancai.

150
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,600
Shancai. Hey.

151
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,320
Are you okay?

152
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,680
Stand up.

153
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,400
Daoming Si.

154
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,000
-What are you babbling about?
-Am I...

155
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
-I'm here. I won't let you die.
-...already dead?

156
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,960
Xiayou didn't go outside.

157
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
-You've been lied to.
-Where's Xiaoyou?

158
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
-That's good.
-Shancai.

159
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
Hey.

160
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
Shancai, don't fall asleep.

161
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,800
Hey, stay awake.

162
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,720
Wake up. Hey.

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,160
You'll freeze if you sleep.

164
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,480
Come, Shancai.

165
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,000
Get up.

166
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,960
I'll carry you. Here.

167
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,200
Shancai, hang in there.

168
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,360
Stay awake.

169
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
We're almost there. Hang in there.

170
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,960
Dong Shancai.

171
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
Shancai. Dong Shancai!

172
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
Don't sleep.

173
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,960
You must not sleep.

174
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
Shancai.

175
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,760
Wake up.

176
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,640
Hang on.

177
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
Stay warm.

178
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,200
We'll stay here until it's morning.

179
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,480
Wait here. Trust me.

180
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,800
I'll be right back.

181
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Shancai. Shancai.

182
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,240
Hang in there.

183
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
It'll be fine.

184
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,480
Si will find Shancai.

185
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,000
Well? What did they say?

186
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,280
The blizzard is so bad
they can't start searching.

187
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,200
They told us not to go out on our own.

188
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,960
Luckily there's a storeroom at the back.

189
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,360
The wood should be enough until tomorrow.

190
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
Shancai.

191
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,160
Hang in there. Don't sleep.

192
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Daoming Si.

193
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,440
You'll warm up soon.

194
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,960
Hang in there.

195
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm going to see if there's anything else
to keep you warm.

196
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,520
Stay awake. Don't fall asleep.

197
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
Incredible.

198
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,600
Daoming Si actually saved me
in the snowstorm.

199
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,400
If it wasn't for him,

200
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,040
I'd probably be dead.

201
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
What a weird feeling.

202
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,600
Despite not knowing
whether we could survive the night,

203
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
all that doesn't matter now.

204
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
Because at this moment
where I'm with Daoming Si,

205
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
my heart

206
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,040
feels warm

207
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
and fuzzy.

208
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,960
No, I have to go look for Shancai. -What if she doesn't come back?
-Xiaoyou, calm down.

209
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,960
There are already two of them out there.
It's riskier if you go too.

210
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,600
But if I hadn't nagged her
about coming to Canada,

211
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,280
this wouldn't have happened to Shancai.

212
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,240
Xiaoyou.

213
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,320
Don't worry.

214
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,760
But Shancai...

215
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
Okay, I'll go with you.

216
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,400
Yes, we should all go.
It's safer in numbers.

217
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Wait, Ximen.

218
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
We should think about this.

219
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,000
But we can't just do nothing.

220
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
Staying here is the best way.

221
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
But Si is...

222
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,120
We all believe in Si, right?

223
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,960
We believe that
he's with Shancai right now.

224
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,520
They will be okay. Just one night.

225
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,040
Wait until tomorrow.

226
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,400
We'll go find them tomorrow morning.

227
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Okay.

228
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,320
You're right.

229
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,840
Si isn't an ordinary person.

230
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,760
He is...

231
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,000
an animal with passion.

232
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
Here.

233
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Drink it hot.

234
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
Go on.

235
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
We're too far away from the cabin.

236
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
It's pretty deserted.

237
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,400
I couldn't find anything useful.

238
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,960
How do you feel? Is the hot water helping?

239
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,600
I feel like my body doesn't belong to me.

240
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,480
I can't feel anything.

241
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,000
There's only one other way.

242
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,200
You too.

243
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,240
Are you human, Daoming Si?

244
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Stupid girl.

245
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,320
Do you know your situation?
Stop imagining things.

246
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,760
What are you doing then?

247
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,440
I thought I could warm you up
with my body.

248
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,560
You're beyond help.

249
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,320
Why did you undress?

250
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,920
Your clothes are wet.

251
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Wearing it will only make you feel colder.

252
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't save you
if you keep being stubborn.

253
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
-Are you going to undress--
-Turn around.

254
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,720
Daoming Si, don't look at me.

255
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,960
Don't touch me.

256
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm trying to save you.

257
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,520
Just lie still.

258
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,480
You'll warm up.

259
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,560
He's only trying to save me.

260
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
Dong Shancai, stop imagining things.

261
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,120
Sleep.

262
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,640
We can go back once morning comes.

263
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,400
I can't think of anything
more embarrassing.

264
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Daoming Si and I are actually
hugging each other half-naked.

265
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
How am I going to face him again?

266
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't be bothered about that now.

267
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
I'll sleep comfortably.

268
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,240
I'll pretend I'm hugging a big dog.

269
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
All safe

270
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,720
and warm.

271
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,720
Why are you looking at me? I wasn't looking at you.

272
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,680
Hurry up and get dressed.

273
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,200
Can you promise me one thing?

274
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,080
What?

275
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Can you stop doing things that worry me?

276
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,880
Do you know that...

277
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,200
I was sick with worry last night over you?

278
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,480
I promise.

279
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,800
How do you feel? Better?

280
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,840
Yes, better.

281
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
Hey, why are you so heavy?

282
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,400
You can put me down.

283
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,680
Shancai. Shancai.

284
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm so glad you're okay. I thought something happened to you.

285
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,520
It's all my fault.

286
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,920
Don't say that.

287
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,360
If it was you,

288
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,000
I'd do the same.

289
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,160
We thought you died out there.

290
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,680
A mere blizzard can't do anything to me.

291
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Glad that you're safe.

292
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Sure, we're okay.

293
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,640
But...

294
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,280
who was it that said Xiaoyou went out?

295
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Shancai, I'm so glad you're safe.

296
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,160
People say that you'll be blessed
if you survive a crisis.

297
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
Yes, Shancai.

298
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,920
We are...

299
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
Thank goodness you're back.

300
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,840
If Shancai and Si
had died in the blizzard,

301
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,760
how would you make up for it?

302
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
Please leave, the two of you.

303
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,840
I won't allow such despicable women

304
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
to be under the same roof as me.

305
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,920
Daoming Si.

306
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,920
It's cold and snowy outside.

307
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,080
We'll freeze if we leave this house.

308
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,040
Please, Daoming Si. Don't kick us out.

309
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,200
Funny how that didn't cross your mind
when you lied to Shancai!

310
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
Shancai.

311
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
Please forgive us.

312
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,240
Shancai, you're a good person.

313
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,920
You wouldn't let us
freeze to death outside.

314
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,440
You'll forgive us, right?

315
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,440
That's enough. Get out.

316
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Wait.

317
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm back safe and sound. I hurt my foot.

318
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,880
But it's nothing serious.

319
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,240
Why don't we...

320
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,000
just forget about it?

321
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
Forget about it?

322
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
Did you forget
that you almost died out there?

323
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
If you forgive them so easily,

324
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,520
knowing how self-centered these two are,

325
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,800
-they'd cause even more harm.
-No.

326
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,480
This time was a misunderstanding.

327
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,360
We're willing to do anything
as long as you don't kick us out.

328
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,720
Yes, anything.

329
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,320
Daoming Si.

330
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,360
I'll punish them.

331
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Yes. Shancai, you can punish us.

332
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,440
Do whatever you want.

333
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
Tell us, how are you going to punish them?

334
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,840
I'll get them...

335
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,720
to clean the house.

336
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
Clean the house?

337
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,440
That's the punishment?

338
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,000
They'll need to clean
for at least ten years.

339
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,240
Okay, we'll clean it right away.

340
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Where's the broom?

341
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,000
Thanks, Shancai. Thanks, Daoming Si.

342
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,640
It was snowing so hard.

343
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,240
You two must be thirsty and cold.

344
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,160
How about some wine to warm up?

345
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,160
The blizzard was terrible last night.

346
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
How did you two survive?

347
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,600
What do you mean?

348
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,000
It was snowing so heavily.

349
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,960
Where did you go?

350
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,280
Could it be like what happens
in romance movies?

351
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,480
Holding one another
while being naked to keep warm?

352
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,640
-No way.
-No way.

353
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,160
-We guessed it.
-We guessed it.

354
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,840
"I'm scared, so cold.

355
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,440
I'm going to faint."

356
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,840
"Come, lean on me.

357
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,160
My chest is warm."

358
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,360
"Hold me tight.

359
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,000
Hold me tighter."

360
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,720
Huaze Lei.

361
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
You can be the blazing fire.

362
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,960
Hurry up.

363
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,280
"Feel the warmth."

364
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,440
That's enough.

365
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,080
Stop it.

366
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
We didn't do that.

367
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,520
Why are you two blushing?

368
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,040
Who's blushing?

369
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,640
I'm not.

370
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,640
I can't be bothered with this.
This is lame.

371
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm going to shower.

372
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,680
The door is that way, sir. I'm going too.

373
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,400
Hey.

374
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
Shancai, you're incredible.

375
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,360
I was going to look for you.

376
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,920
But seeing the blizzard, I chickened out.

377
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,160
It's because I was worried about you.

378
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,560
You're my best friend. What am I going to tell your parents

379
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,040
if something happened to you?

380
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,920
Daoming Si is just as brave as you are.

381
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,360
When he heard you were missing,
he ran out to save you without a word.

382
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,240
I didn't expect him to show up.

383
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
To be honest,

384
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
the way he acted last night

385
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,360
was so different from usual.

386
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,120
Actually, there's another person
who was really worried.

387
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Huaze Lei.

388
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,440
When he heard that you went out
because of Xinhui and Baihe,

389
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,400
he got angry and threw wine at them.

390
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,200
Huaze Lei threw his wine?

391
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,520
Did I hear that right?

392
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,160
He's such an amiable guy.

393
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,120
I can't believe he acted out like that.

394
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
It must be because it was you.

395
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,000
You're a dear friend to him.

396
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,440
That's why he did something
he normally wouldn't have.

397
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,920
Huaze Lei.

398
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Thank you.

399
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
I heard it all from Xiaoyou.

400
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,040
You're welcome.

401
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,360
It didn't sit well with me

402
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,440
how some people
could put a life in danger.

403
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,360
That was very irresponsible.

404
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,840
Anyway,

405
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,680
it must've been traumatic for you.

406
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Are you feeling okay?

407
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,080
I'm the undying weed, Shancai.

408
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
I'm totally fine.

409
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,640
This is why people worry about you.

410
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,680
Are you worried about me?

411
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
That goes without saying.

412
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,280
I could truly feel
the warmth of friendship

413
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,000
in this icy, foreign land.

414
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
Suddenly, it doesn't seem so cold.

415
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Where's Si?

416
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,240
He was just here. Did you guys see Shancai?

417
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Where is she?

418
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,120
What are you doing out here? I came out for some fresh air.

419
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,040
You?

420
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,920
I came to find you.

421
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,040
Shancai.

422
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,639
Nobody else is around.

423
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,719
Do you have something to say?

424
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Something to say?

425
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,080
No.

426
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,280
You said no without thinking.

427
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,320
What do you want me to say?

428
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Or is there something you want to hear?

429
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
Figure it out.

430
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Nobody asks the other person
what they want to hear.

431
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
Don't you have anything
to say to your savior?

432
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,600
I almost forgot to thank you.

433
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,600
Thank you.

434
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,440
Just a "thank you"?

435
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,320
Is "thank you" all that you owe me?

436
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,840
I still owe you 500,000 yuan.

437
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,000
I've already got
a detailed repayment plan.

438
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,480
Every month, I'll use two thirds
of my salary to pay you.

439
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,120
I'm going to get another job.

440
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,920
-This way--
-Nobody wants to hear that.

441
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,520
You want me to pay you all at once?

442
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,160
That's a little difficult for me.

443
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,320
I hope you can understand.

444
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,920
Fireworks!

445
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,520
Little Xiaoyou, I'm so happy
to spend time with you.

446
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,920
Happy New Year.

447
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,160
Happy New Year.

448
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,160
Hey, are you honestly dumb
or are you just pretending to be dumb?

449
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
It's the new year.
Why are you yelling at me?

450
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,720
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

451
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,960
That's because you won't say it.

452
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,280
Say what?

453
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,160
So you're not going to say it?

454
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Fine. I'll do it then.

455
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,560
Go on.

456
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,800
Shancai.

457
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,800
I love you.

458
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Happy New Year!

459
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,320
Happy New Year!

460
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,560
I said it.

461
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,920
I really said it.

462
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,120
Daoming Si.

463
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,120
One more time.

464
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Shut up.

465
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,080
Having fun?

466
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,480
Mom!

467
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,280
I'm right here.

468
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,600
Keep quiet.

469
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,320
This is an important call.

470
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,200
I'm Dong Danian.

471
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,520
Wishing you a prosperous new year.

472
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,120
Best of luck and good fortune.

473
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
How did this happen?

474
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,680
Gosh.

475
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,960
I sprained my ankle while skiing.

476
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
It's fine now.

477
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,480
You clumsy girl.
You should be more careful. How was the trip?

478
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,200
Not bad.

479
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
The scenery was nice.

480
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,200
We counted down to the new year.
It was fun.

481
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,680
Shancai.

482
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,560
Show us the photos you took
when you're free.

483
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,760
Tell me.

484
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,840
How did it go with Daoming Si this time?

485
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,680
I'm Dong Danian.

486
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,880
-Wishing you a happy new year.
-He's...

487
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,080
A prosperous and healthy

488
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,480
-new year.
-It's a long story.

489
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,280
What do you--

490
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,160
What do you mean by "a long story"?

491
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,720
Well...

492
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,520
Forget it. It's too embarrassing to tell.

493
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,760
Shancai, tell us honestly.

494
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,680
While you were in Canada,

495
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,840
who did you stay with?

496
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,640
With Xiaoyou. I told you guys, right?

497
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,640
-You were with Xiaoyou every night?
-Yes.

498
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,120
You little whore.

499
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,560
Did you spend the night with Daoming Si?

500
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,120
I...

501
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
What did I tell you before you left?

502
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,560
I want you to have a good relationship
with a good man.

503
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,360
I didn't ask you to sleep around.
What happened to you?

504
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,120
I'll make that boy pay.

505
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,920
How dare he bully our daughter?

506
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,200
Give me his contact number.

507
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,680
Dad, Mom.

508
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,520
It wasn't like that.

509
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,720
Nothing happened between us.

510
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,400
Nothing happened?

511
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,720
You didn't hug and kiss?

512
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,960
That's all right, you know.

513
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
What's the matter?

514
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,360
That's what we did when we were in love.

515
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,800
Don't compare him to me.

516
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,200
Besides,

517
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,760
who could say no to your beauty?

518
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
I'm going back to my room.

519
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,080
-Be careful.
-Your foot... Is it really okay?

520
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
Si, you're in a good mood.

521
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,840
There's only us here.

522
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,880
You can say it.

523
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,320
What really happened with Shancai?

524
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,320
Yeah, what happened?

525
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,480
What do you mean? It's like that.

526
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,840
"Like that" means what exactly?

527
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,920
Like that.

528
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,800
You two were stuck together
in the blizzard.

529
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,280
Where were you and Shancai

530
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,240
on New Year's Eve?

531
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,520
I told her what I had to
on New Year's Eve.

532
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,360
Why didn't you do what you had to?

533
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,640
For instance, holding her close

534
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,560
and kissing.

535
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,800
Shouldn't you say it before doing it?

536
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,320
Why didn't you do it first
before saying it then?

537
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,440
I, Daoming Si, have my own way.

538
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,760
I decide what I want to do.
It was too noisy that night anyway.

539
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,440
You guys are being annoying.

540
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,760
Go bug Huaze Lei.

541
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,960
Stop bugging me.

542
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,320
Fine. I'll do it then.

543
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,280
Go on.

544
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,880
Shancai. I love you.

545
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,120
-What really happened?
-What really happened?
