1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 10

3
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,360
Among these cards,
which has the highest value?

4
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Ace of Diamonds.

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,640
Are you sure?

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm sure. Hearts...

7
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,760
Jack of Hearts. Clubs...

8
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
King of Clubs.

9
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,600
Diamonds.

10
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Spades...

11
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
Queen of Spades.

12
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
Am I wrong again?

13
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,520
No, but you're too slow.

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,600
Hey, it's quite amazing
that I didn't make a mistake, okay?

15
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,320
I'll do better.

16
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,760
Since you already know the basics,

17
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,400
the biggest problem now

18
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
is that you always expose
the cards you have.

19
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
No way.

20
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,640
You have a lot of spades.

21
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Am I right?

22
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,800
You're insanely good at this.

23
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,560
Try to bluff and see if you can fool me.

24
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
If you can do that,
then we stand a chance.

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
All right.

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Do you like studying at Mingde University?

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Yes.

28
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
The people here are really amazing.

29
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,920
You don't like it here.

30
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,640
That doesn't count. You already know that.

31
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,440
Do you like Si?

32
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
Of course not.

33
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
I asked you to fool me.

34
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,760
If you don't like him,
you should have said that you do.

35
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,680
I couldn't make myself say that.

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,080
Then do you like me?

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
No.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,720
That seems like the truth.

39
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
That's not true.

40
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,959
I was just kidding.

41
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,280
Who asks questions like that?

42
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,280
How can I answer that?

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
Only you can't.

44
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
Then do you like Jing?

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
Sorry.

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
I shouldn't have asked that question.

47
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,600
If I say I'm already over her,
would you believe me?

48
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
Do you want me to stay here?

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Yes.

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,240
Then I'll do my best to stay,

51
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,000
so that I can do everything
to protect you.

52
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,880
If Shancai leaves Mingde,

53
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll leave F4.

54
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
Do you know what you're saying?

55
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Although it's cool to be a part of F4,

56
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,280
if you bully Shancai, you're my enemy.

57
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,360
Qinghe, you're not that important.

58
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
And Shancai doesn't even like you.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
That doesn't matter.

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
I like Shancai.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
If I expect the person I like
to like me as well,

62
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
that's not manly at all.

63
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Daoming Si.

64
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,400
If you like Shancai,
you have to treat her nicely.

65
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
Even if Shancai doesn't like you,

66
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,000
it should be enough for you
to see her happy,

67
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
isn't it?

68
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,160
Qinghe, I suddenly realized
that you have the potential to join F4.

69
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,880
What you just said is very manly.

70
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,920
Start practicing how to play Bridge.

71
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
This way, if F4 really loses a member,

72
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,840
at least we can have a full team
in competitions.

73
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
From the very first day
I entered Mingde University,

74
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
I heard about all sorts of bets made
when playing against F4.

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,320
I never imagined

76
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,800
I'd receive a joker card
to fight Daoming Si

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,640
with Huaze Lei on my side
during my freshman year.

78
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,200
Who do you think will win?

79
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,040
Daoming Si, of course.

80
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,920
Shancai doesn't know how to play Bridge.

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,440
Even if Huaze Lei is amazing at it,
she'll be useless.

82
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,400
Shancai.

83
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Do your best. I hope you'll win.

84
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,640
Look.

85
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,960
SHANCAI, YOU CAN DO IT

86
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,160
Did you sleep well last night?

87
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm so nervous.
I didn't sleep well at all.

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,720
Don't be scared.

89
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,240
Actually, I slept really well.
I fooled you, right?

90
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,320
Yes, you did.
You can make it on your own now.

91
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,560
Then do we stand a chance now?

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
My gosh!

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
-Why are they holding hands?
-Right?

94
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
Shancai.

95
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,720
Welcome to the Bridge Room and to
the two-on-two competition against the F4.

96
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Did Huaze Lei explain the rules to you?

97
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Yes.

98
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,400
Do you plan to hold hands
while playing Bridge?

99
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,440
Si will play with Meizuo,
and Shancai with Lei.

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,159
The two teams will take turns dealing.

101
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,799
Six tricks will be added
to the card they have called.

102
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,120
Win the number you bid or more,
and you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.

103
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
Are we clear?

104
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
Yes.

105
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,640
Please have a seat.

106
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
You know what's at stake, right?

107
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,920
Don't we all?

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,000
What's at stake here?

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
Shancai, tell them.

110
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,880
What's at stake

111
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,280
is that if I win,

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,640
you have to forgive me.

113
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
Is it that important to you?

114
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,640
Yes.

115
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,280
From what I can see,

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,080
you just want to be free from guilt
when you're in a relationship with Lei.

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,600
Maybe.

118
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
Then I definitely refuse to lose.

119
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,160
What if I win?

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
Then I won't see Shancai again.

121
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
You said that on your own accord.

122
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Yes, I did.

123
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
But I might not lose.

124
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Right?

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
Yes.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,600
All right. Let the competition begin.

127
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,080
Please check your cards.

128
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,040
Shancai, you can call your card first.

129
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,720
One of Hearts.

130
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,760
One of Spades.

131
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,120
Three of Hearts.

132
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
What?

133
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Huaze Lei is calling
the same Hearts suit as me? I don't have any Hearts cards.

134
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,400
I just bluffed it initially.

135
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,920
Four of Clubs.

136
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,960
Daoming Si is calling four of Clubs now.

137
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
If I want to continue calling,
I have to go with four too.

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,760
That means I should at least
win ten tricks in order to win.

139
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
I only have three Clubs cards.

140
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
If Huaze Lei also has them...

141
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,520
The trump suit is Clubs.

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,560
Huaze Lei, please proceed.

143
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,840
Shancai, Lei made a mistake.

144
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
He thinks that you have the ace of Hearts.

145
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,280
That's why he played the Hearts suit.

146
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,080
He wants you to win the first trick.

147
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
Actually, the ace of Hearts is with me.

148
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,680
It looks like your plan
is not going to work.

149
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Shancai has no Hearts. The trump suit,
two of Clubs, wins the first trick.

150
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Shancai, you did great.

151
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,800
I never thought the innocent Shancai
would cheat.

152
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,760
Even if Shancai cheats, she's still cute.

153
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,680
Unlike others who tell the truth,
but always hurts people.

154
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,440
A liar is more despicable, of course.

155
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,040
Aren't you like that?

156
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,800
Please note that this is a Bridge game.

157
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,680
Refrain from verbal attacks.

158
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,520
Shancai, the winner continues playing. Shancai's ace of Diamonds beats you all.

159
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,800
-She wins the second trick.
-Shancai, you're doing great.

160
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
Huaze Lei taught me well.

161
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,880
She's a quick study.

162
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Please continue.

163
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,520
I won't let you two win again.

164
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,280
Says who?

165
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
We might not lose.

166
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,760
"We"?

167
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,000
Shancai.

168
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,360
The "we" that you and Huaze Lei refer to

169
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
will soon disappear
from Mingde University.

170
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Why are they still not out?

171
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,240
We finished the Big and Small game
in ten minutes.

172
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,520
Qinghe, Shancai and Daoming Si
are playing an official game of Bridge.

173
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,560
I know how to play that too.

174
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,720
If I play them,
I'm sure F4 would surrender immediately.

175
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
You silly boy.

176
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,280
F4 is the champion of countless
international Bridge competitions.

177
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,520
Whom do you think you're fooling?

178
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,880
Qinghe, I know that you
and Shancai are close.

179
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
But even so, you have to face reality.

180
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,120
I think it would be better for you
to pray that she gets a nice set of cards.

181
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
Xinhui, you're right.

182
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,880
God, please protect the innocent
and cute Shancai.

183
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,080
Don't let her be bullied
by the monster, Daoming Si.

184
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,000
Shancai.

185
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
You're bound to lose.

186
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,360
No one has the trump suit now.

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,520
And I'm now going to play
the Spade suit that you don't have.

188
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,280
You'll surely lose this round.

189
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
You didn't have the King of Spades?

190
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
Shancai's King of Spades
beats Si's Queen of Spades.

191
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
I thought we were bound to lose.

192
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,560
Shancai, you're bound to lose, all right.

193
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
Based on the cards played earlier,

194
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,320
we all should have Diamonds
left in our hands.

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Si's card should be the highest among us.

196
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,080
My memory can't be wrong,

197
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,560
so you will lose this round.

198
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
Really?

199
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400
Are we really going to lose?

200
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Yes, that's the smile.

201
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,560
That's the priceless smile.

202
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,720
It gives me courage.

203
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm not afraid anymore.

204
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Hey! Play your card!

205
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,600
Si.

206
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Are you sure you'll win?

207
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,320
We can't be too sure.

208
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
Maybe he doesn't have any Diamonds.

209
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,600
If so, then we win.

210
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,120
If we win,

211
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,360
the one who'll leave
Mingde University is Daoming Si.

212
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
In that case,

213
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
maybe our stakes are too high.

214
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
Because Si will surely win.

215
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,760
Which means, the ones leaving
Mingde University will be Lei and Shancai.

216
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,520
It's fine if we can't see Lei here.

217
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
We can go to his house. If Shancai leaves,

218
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,000
there will be no Ms. Flying Kick
at Mingde.

219
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,080
That's fine.

220
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,520
Then the school will no longer
have girls from average--

221
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,080
Daoming Si. Are you playing or not?

222
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,680
You're not scared, are you?

223
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,520
Play your card.

224
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,640
I'll acknowledge it if I lose.

225
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm not playing anymore! You guys suck.

226
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,440
You won.

227
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,120
We won?

228
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,760
Huaze Lei, we won.

229
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,120
Actually, we didn't win.

230
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
Why not?

231
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,080
Si couldn't beat my card.

232
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
That's why he got mad
he mixed the cards up.

233
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,160
What a sore loser.

234
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,560
Si's card was actually higher
than all of ours.

235
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Meizuo.

236
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,960
This was Si's card.

237
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,400
My memory cannot be wrong.

238
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,880
Nobody compares to Meizuo
in remembering cards.

239
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
Then he won.

240
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Why did he stop playing?

241
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,200
What do you think?

242
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,120
Let's go. Ms. Zhuang is still waiting
to celebrate with us.

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
Come on.

244
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
To all our good times together.

245
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,920
Cheers.

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,360
Cheers.

247
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,560
I think we were able to settle
the matter today, right?

248
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
I hope so.

249
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,120
But Si isn't home yet.

250
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm not sure where he went
after the competition.

251
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,200
He'll be fine.

252
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,320
Si used to quit in the middle
of playing Bridge before too.

253
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,920
I know my brother very well.

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,320
He's a self-centered, childish person.

255
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
It's my fault.
I didn't discipline him well.

256
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,440
Don't mind him.

257
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,280
Let's enjoy the food together.

258
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Ms. Zhuang, we're not pigs.
We can't finish all of this.

259
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,840
You eat too little.

260
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,240
That's why you're so tall and skinny.
It's abnormal.

261
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Shancai, eat up.

262
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,480
Don't act like a cow silently grazing.

263
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
How could I have an appetite?

264
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,840
I was so nervous, that my stomach hurts.

265
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
Nervous about what?

266
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,440
The stakes for the bet with Daoming Si.

267
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
From the day I entered Mingde University,

268
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,000
I heard all sorts of rumors
about F4 and Joker cards.

269
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,480
And it was my first time playing Bridge.

270
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,320
I was under so much pressure.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
I see.

272
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
But Shancai,

273
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,280
those rumors were created by people
jealous of Si and the F4.

274
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,320
They challenged them but knew
they couldn't beat them,

275
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,960
and were too ashamed to admit it.

276
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
We can't help it.

277
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,680
So many people challenged us.

278
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,320
It was too much to handle.

279
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,640
If we didn't require a bet,

280
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,840
we'd need to play Bridge
with people daily.

281
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,640
We'd die from exhaustion.

282
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,920
They're all grown up. They're not childish anymore.

283
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,360
That's a cause for celebration.

284
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
Come on. Cheers.

285
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,400
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

286
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Ms. Zhuang,
every time you have a few drinks,

287
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,240
you become wild and carefree.

288
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
I can't believe that the kids
who wore open-crotch pants

289
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,400
and wet their beds

290
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,760
have now reached the age
when they're fighting over a girl.

291
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,280
That's really amazing.

292
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,040
The famous F4 wore open-crotch pants

293
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,920
and even wet their beds.

294
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,040
-I really can't imagine it.
-Shut up.

295
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
Ms. Zhuang, that's ancient history.

296
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
-Let's not mention that.
-What does it matter?

297
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,640
We've all been there.

298
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,600
Furthermore, Ximen and Meizuo would bite
each other's toes when they were young.

299
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,320
They were drooling
while biting each other.

300
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,640
They kept clamoring for their pacifiers.

301
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,080
And Lei...

302
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,600
When he was young, he stuck his head
in the toilet when he washed his hair.

303
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,840
It got stuck there
and we couldn't get it out.

304
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,640
Ms. Zhuang, that's enough.

305
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,960
Why do you have to remember those things?

306
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,880
I didn't mention the time
you guys wore my--

307
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
Cheers.

308
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,680
Hey.

309
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,720
Look where you're going.

310
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,600
Hey.

311
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Are you deaf?

312
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,840
It's a pain talking to deaf people.
You're lucky I'm lazy.

313
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
What did you say?

314
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
I...

315
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,880
I asked what you said.

316
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,600
I didn't...

317
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,280
You said "Lei"!

318
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,080
No, I said, "lazy."

319
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,520
You can't let me hear the word "Lei."
Understood?

320
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
Understood.

321
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm Daoming Si.

322
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,920
How can I be sad because of a girl?

323
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,320
-Right?
-Right.

324
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm not depressed. I'm...

325
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,960
33721842369.

326
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,280
17718512317.

327
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
What are you doing?

328
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,720
We're seeing whose memory is better.

329
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,960
Who can memorize more ex's phone numbers.

330
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,600
17701672125.

331
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Isn't that Li's number?

332
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,680
She liked me first.

333
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,640
Shut up.

334
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,520
Hey, we shouldn't be
the only ones doing this.

335
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,120
Girls should participate too.

336
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,120
Shancai, tell us an ex-boyfriend's number.

337
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,920
Shancai doesn't have an ex-boyfriend.
You don't need to ask her.

338
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,960
Si's number

339
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,640
is 10881217039.

340
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,200
Oh, please.

341
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,360
Si is not Shancai's ex-boyfriend.

342
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,120
He liked her by himself.

343
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Right, Shancai?

344
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,840
Why did you hit me again?

345
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,840
Shancai.

346
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,520
How far have you and Lei gone?

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,920
We went out on a date.

348
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,840
Shancai may seem like a buffalo

349
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,280
compared to the gorgeous Jing,

350
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,600
but Lei,

351
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,400
this is not what a normal guy would do.

352
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,880
Ms. Zhuang.

353
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,200
The most intimate they got
was probably at the airport

354
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,400
when Lei kissed Shancai's forehead.

355
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
You two are moving too slowly.

356
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,920
That's why Si had the chance
to get between you.

357
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,560
How about spending the night
together tonight,

358
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,000
just the two of you,

359
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,080
so that you can have
some quality time together?

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,480
What does that mean?

361
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
What are you planning to do?

362
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,800
Sure.

363
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,600
I wanted to speak to Shancai alone anyway.

364
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,760
What did you want to speak to me about?

365
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,400
I'm not too sure either.

366
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,920
I just want to talk to you alone.

367
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Do you want to suggest a topic
we can talk about?

368
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
How about

369
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
we talk about

370
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,520
our graduation trip?

371
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
We went to Chongming Island

372
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,200
for our graduation trip.

373
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,440
At night, we had pillow fights.

374
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
We also had a bonfire.

375
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,960
When I think about it now,

376
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,760
it's still a very special memory.

377
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,840
How about you? Where did you go?

378
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
Prague.

379
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,240
I've never been--

380
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,680
Why are you staring at me?

381
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,800
You're so ugly.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,880
Just kidding.

383
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
But when I look at you this way,
you're really ordinary

384
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,480
and plain.

385
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,800
You don't need to remind me, okay?

386
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
However, the way you looked
so serious during our game today

387
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,040
was mesmerizing.

388
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,000
I never understood
why Si likes you so much before,

389
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,040
but I finally understood today.

390
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,920
Actually...

391
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,120
Actually, what?

392
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,680
I'm not sure how I feel about you.

393
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,280
Ximen said

394
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,680
it may be because I'm still hurt
about Jing,

395
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,560
and that I'm using you to forget her.

396
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,120
Maybe. However...

397
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
It's fine.

398
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,720
I understand.

399
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,840
I know how you feel about Jing.

400
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,280
I also know how special she is to you.

401
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
Why are you alone again?

402
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,000
I looked for you for so long,
my legs are tired.

403
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,240
From now on, don't hide
from us again, okay?

404
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,400
What are you drawing?

405
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,280
Is that me?

406
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,480
It really looks like me.
I like it so much.

407
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,440
When I was little, everyone mocked me
and said my drawings were ugly.

408
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,320
Except Jing.

409
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,840
Jing is a really special person.

410
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm not sure if I can love
another person again.

411
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
Although I really like you,

412
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,760
I know it's not love.

413
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,400
It's fine.

414
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,280
Sorry.

415
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,040
Why are you apologizing to me?

416
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,440
If I didn't come back,
you could've been with Si.

417
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,360
You don't have to apologize to me.

418
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,840
Who would want to be with him?

419
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,560
And...

420
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,800
if this hadn't happened,

421
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,080
I wouldn't have witnessed
the new person you are now.

422
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
The new person?

423
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
How am I different?

424
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,600
The old you

425
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,040
was very lazy.

426
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
And the way you spoke was so cold.

427
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,720
You seemed

428
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,800
very distant.

429
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Like this.

430
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,280
"I'm not interested
in other people's problems."

431
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,520
You know,

432
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
every time you said

433
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,160
that other people's problems
were not your concern,

434
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,280
I felt really sad.

435
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,760
But you're completely different now.

436
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,320
I like the new person you are now.

437
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm willing

438
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,600
to be your good friend forever.

439
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,880
Thank you for being so understanding.

440
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,360
I'm home.

441
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,920
Si, your sister, Shancai

442
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,520
and your best friends are having
a gathering in the dining room.

443
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,400
How dare they have a gathering here?

444
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,040
You're so close with my brother.

445
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,240
Why won't you teach him
how to get along with girls?

446
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Ms. Zhuang, aside from you,

447
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,600
what other girls can get along with Si?

448
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,520
Ms. Zhuang, it isn't just the girls.

449
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,960
Even the guys.

450
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,160
Aside from us,
no one wants to play with him.

451
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,840
You're right.

452
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,880
We all inherited our mom's

453
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,840
bratty, difficult and
hard-to-get-along-with attitude.

454
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,400
As for Lei, even though
he's unpredictable,

455
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,320
he has become very patient with her

456
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,880
once he liked her.

457
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,040
No wonder we hear a "pow"

458
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,840
whenever Shancai sees Si.

459
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,120
It's like being in love with a time bomb.

460
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,200
Let my brother suffer a little.

461
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,600
Sometimes, being heartbroken
is not a bad thing.

462
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,440
I wonder what Shancai and Lei

463
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
are doing right now.

464
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,920
They should be doing what they need to do.

465
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
Si.

466
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,160
What does Si have to do
with what they're doing?

467
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,000
What?

468
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,240
Si, why are you home so late?

469
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,240
Si, are you tired?

470
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,760
Do you want to go get some rest?

471
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,080
What were you talking about?

472
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
We don't have to hide this from him.

473
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,640
We have to tell him eventually.

474
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Si.

475
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,680
Shancai and Lei
are in a bedroom right now.

476
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,680
If you're a real man,
you should be happy for them.

477
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,640
Why does it smell like gunpowder?

478
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,320
I even hear the trigger for a bomb
being engaged.

479
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,760
What do you think?
Is there anything you want to say?

480
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
I never thought that Lei
had his ways with women.

481
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,040
It's a good thing, isn't it?

482
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,360
That's great, Si.

483
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
-You're really over her.
-Si.

484
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,200
You're doing great.

485
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,800
-You'll become a good man--
-Shut it!

486
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm starving.

487
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Get me something to eat.

488
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,320
Lei.

489
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,080
Thank you for telling me those things
last night.

490
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,360
Jing.

491
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,880
It's true, I still can't compare to you.

492
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,480
But it doesn't matter.

493
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm Shancai, the weed.

494
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
Si, why are you up so early?

495
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,199
Ximen.

496
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,560
Do you remember when I took
Lei's favorite toy?

497
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,520
When was that?

498
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,400
When we first entered grade school.

499
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,760
I liked that autographed Spiderman

500
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,560
with the serial number.

501
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
If I had asked my dad,

502
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,160
he would've gotten it for me from the U.S.

503
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,160
As many as I wanted.

504
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,640
What are you holding?

505
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,160
Let me see.

506
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Give it to me.

507
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,800
The more he treasured it,
the more I wanted it.

508
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,840
I know

509
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,840
that I made an unforgivable mistake.

510
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,000
You should've let go sooner!

511
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,160
It's all your fault.

512
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,400
But I just wouldn't admit it.

513
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,960
That night,

514
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,720
I couldn't sleep.

515
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,080
I thought that Lei would be mad
at me the next morning.

516
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,680
So I planned to get you two

517
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,080
and bully him the next day.

518
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,280
That's when I realized

519
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,480
that I'd never be able to beat him.

520
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,920
Nobody ever mentioned it again.

521
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,360
Maybe Lei had also forgotten about it.

522
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,280
But I still feel

523
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,400
that I owe him somehow.

524
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,680
I think...

525
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,280
it's time to make it up to him.

526
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,000
Are you talking about Shancai?

527
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,560
I shouldn't torment her anymore.

528
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Shancai, come here.

529
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,840
We have something to tell you.

530
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
Dad, Mom.

531
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,080
Sorry. I stayed over
at my friend's place last night.

532
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,520
I wasn't able to tell you about it.

533
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,960
Shancai.

534
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
You can't live here anymore.

535
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,960
Why?

536
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,960
Your dad's moving into
a different company housing.

537
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
Where?

538
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,720
"Great Earnings Investment
Consulting Corporation."

539
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,880
Dad, really?

540
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,280
That's right.

541
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
I had an interview a few days ago.

542
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,560
The boss said that I have a lot
of potential in investment.

543
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,280
Not only does this company
guarantee bonuses,

544
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
the salaries are also guaranteed.

545
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,880
I'm going to be rich.

546
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
Do you know anything
about investment consulting?

547
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,080
Right? I asked him the same thing.

548
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,360
But he said that the company
has a complete "S" something.

549
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,320
Yes.

550
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,400
Just follow the SOP
and you can get all the benefits

551
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
and earn a lot of money.

552
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,760
Is it that simple?

553
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,960
No problem.

554
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,560
I finally found a new career.

555
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,360
If you found a new career,

556
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,200
why do you two look so sad?

557
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,720
Because we have to move.

558
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
We lived in this house for over ten years.

559
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
Just thinking about it makes me sad.

560
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,400
Furthermore,

561
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,000
my money will be invested in that company,

562
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,840
so...

563
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,200
we'll be living in a place
that is smaller.

564
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,480
Then the kitchen will surely be small.

565
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,440
It'll be inconvenient for me
to cook from now on.

566
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,320
What worries me most is...

567
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,840
How do we pack all this stuff?

568
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,080
Just the souvenirs your mom and I bought

569
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,040
when we traveled together
are already a lot.

570
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,640
-Just throw them away.
-Throw them...

571
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
Throw them away?

572
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,080
Those are souvenirs of love.

573
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,520
Throw them...

574
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Shancai, go and pack your things.

575
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,600
We're moving tomorrow.

576
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,280
All right.

577
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,200
What should we do?

578
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Come inside.

579
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,920
We're here.

580
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,280
We're here.

581
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Dear.

582
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
This place might not look nice

583
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,120
and it might not be big,

584
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,280
but dear,

585
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,080
with your taste and ideas,

586
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,880
I know you'll turn it into
an intricate and practical place.

587
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,960
Leave it to me.

588
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,400
I'll buy our furniture from
the second-hand store online.

589
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,840
It's economical and practical.

590
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
The most important thing is that
we're closer to Shancai's school.

591
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,160
She can sleep half an hour more now.

592
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,200
Am I right?

593
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,880
-Yes.
-Dear, you're so great.

594
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,920
You always think about our family.

595
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,560
Marrying you

596
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,400
was the biggest blessing in my life.

597
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,760
I'll do anything to make our family happy.

598
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
Dear, I'll also work hard

599
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,760
for you and our beloved daughter.

600
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,320
I believe in you.

601
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,280
-I'll also work hard.
-Shancai.

602
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,000
You have to study hard.

603
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,720
-You're our family's hope.
-Okay.

604
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,640
-Yes?
-You can do it.

605
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,040
-You can do it.
-I can do it.

606
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,240
Mom, I've already connected the water

607
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
-and electricity--
-Hey.

608
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,520
Check them--

609
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,520
Why didn't you say something?

610
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,800
I called out to you.
What were you thinking about?

611
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,560
Nothing.

612
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,560
You left these books at my house.

613
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,800
I completely forgot about them.

614
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,120
Bring your brain with you, will you?

615
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,880
You're always so absent-minded.

616
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,440
All right.

617
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,360
Did you forget something again? What?

618
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,920
To say thank you.
I brought it to you personally.

619
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,880
Thank you.

620
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,080
It's so strange.

621
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,680
Why is he suddenly acting so normal again?

622
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,480
Shouldn't he be ignoring me?

623
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,120
Frankie Restaurant is looking
for a kitchen assistant.

624
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,520
The hours...

625
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,520
Six to ten at night.

626
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,160
Where is it?

627
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,480
It's near our school.

628
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,280
That's great.

629
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,120
Hi.

630
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,440
I'm here to apply for the kitchen
assistant position.

631
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,560
The kitchen is that way.

632
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,120
Thank you.

633
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,480
Who are you?

634
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,640
Well, I'm here to apply
for the kitchen assistant position.

635
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,120
Kitchen assistant?

636
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,600
We're short on staff right now.
You can start right away.

637
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,880
Peel these potatoes.

638
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,560
Hey, Si.

639
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,720
I never thought you'd recover this fast.

640
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,520
You got over Shancai in just a few days.

641
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Of course.

642
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,400
What was I thinking?

643
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm completely over it now.

644
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,120
Who wants such a cheap girl?

645
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,800
If Lei likes her,
I'll tie a bow on her and give her to him.

646
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,320
Speak of the devil.

647
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,280
Who told him to come here?

648
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,280
Why are you suddenly shooting pool?

649
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,200
It's been a while.

650
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,360
It's all because of Si.

651
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,200
I'm not sure what he's thinking.
He told us to come.

652
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,520
-Hey.
-Si.

653
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,600
Didn't you say
you're completely over it now?

654
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,360
Why are you leaving after I arrived?

655
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm still mad.

656
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,800
Si, where are you going?

657
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,960
Don't mind him. He's always been that way.

658
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,520
Lei, how did it go last night?

659
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,120
What do you mean?

660
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,240
Don't play dumb. You and Shancai.

661
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,600
You two were alone in the room together.

662
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,320
Did something happen?

663
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,480
Aren't we going to shoot pool? Come on.

664
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,120
Hey, why aren't you answering?

665
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,360
There's nothing to hide.

666
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,880
Shancai is a nice girl.

667
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,640
I admit. I almost fell for her.

668
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,160
But how do I say this?

669
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,000
I won't do anything to her.

670
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,320
Why?

671
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,320
Because I won't betray Si.

672
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,640
He's a good friend that we grew up with.

673
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,600
I see.

674
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,760
If Si learns how to treasure
the person he likes

675
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,280
and realizes that he can't
get everything he wants,

676
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,200
then everything that happened
will have been worth it.

677
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,840
Until then,

678
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,040
I'll keep my distance from Shancai.

679
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,080
He would be so happy to hear that.

680
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,040
I don't plan to tell him.

681
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,160
-Why not?
-Why not?

682
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,320
Because Si did something terrible
to me before.
