A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 21

3
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Daoming Si agreed to date me.

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm not sure how it happened so fast.

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,400
I originally wanted to come
and ask you. Then...

6
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,400
Hey.

7
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,120
Monkey. Who are you calling Monkey?

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Xiaozi. I want to tell you something.

9
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,880
I'm not listening to you.
I know what you're going to say.

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,760
You want to say
that you don't like me, right?

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,920
You also sent your friends
to date me today, right?

12
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Do you think that would make me back out?

13
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,560
You're wrong.

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
-My strongest point is perseverance.
-Let's date.

15
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,680
Hey.

16
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
Is that okay?

17
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,400
What did you say?

18
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,200
All right.

19
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,320
Yes.

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,800
Yes.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
He said he'd try to like me.

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm really touched.

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,880
I'm not sure why I'm so happy.

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
I just realized

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,840
that I really like him.

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,000
Shancai.

27
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Are you happy for me?

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,880
I knew you'd succeed.

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
You're not mad, right?

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,880
No.

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,480
Nutrition refers to the calories
contained in the food

32
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,600
as well as other components
good for our health.

33
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,880
Humans consume food
to obtain enough nutrients.

34
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
After food consumption

35
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,400
and going through digestion,
absorption, and metabolism,

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
the body utilizes the substances it needs
to maintain life-sustaining activities.

37
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,960
Through proper nutrition,
a lot of diseases can be prevented.

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,080
I brought my Grandma's banana rice balls.

39
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
See you later.

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,480
Those are the human's six basic elements
for sustaining life.

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,640
Do you know what the six elements are?

42
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,519
They are carbohydrates,

43
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,800
protein, fats, minerals,

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
vitamins.

45
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,360
I heard that Si asked
that monkey to date him.

46
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,480
Si and Monkey.

47
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
I can't imagine it.

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,880
Her name is Xiaozi.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,440
As his friend, you guys should be happy
that he's starting to become mature.

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
Shancai.

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
Why do you seem unaffected by this?

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
Don't you feel upset?

53
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,760
Shancai!

54
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
I finally found you.

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
I brought you lunch today.

56
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Let's eat together.

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Didn't you say you especially like

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,400
-my Grandma's rice balls?
-Shut up.

59
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,680
Eat your rice balls.

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
Do you want some? It's really good.

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
No.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,040
My grandma made this for you.

63
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,320
You can't share it with others.

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,520
How does it taste?

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
Will we get an upset stomach from this?

66
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
It's sticky.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,960
It's delicious.

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
Where did Daoming Si go?

69
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
Where's Meizuo?

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
Meizuo was just here earlier.

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm not sure where he went.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
Si should be on a date
with his girlfriend.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
What?

74
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,680
Daoming Si has a girlfriend?

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,520
Your smile looks so ugly.

76
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,560
I wonder how Si and that monkey is doing.

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,400
Si, why are you walking so fast?

78
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,360
-Are we having a race?
-You're so noisy.

79
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,360
I hate walking slowly.

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,920
Is this even a date?

81
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
What's the difference from before?

82
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,600
I was so looking forward to today's date.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
But you won't even look at me.
And you're not saying anything.

84
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,560
Why are we even together?

85
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
What do you want me to do?

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,520
First of all, you have to match my pace.

87
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,880
Then you have to smile.

88
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
Lastly, you have to talk to me.

89
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,000
Why is it so hard?

90
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,040
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

91
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
So what?

92
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,200
You're my boyfriend.

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Si.

94
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm so happy because you said
you'd try to like me.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,760
Is that true?

96
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,800
I told you I'll try.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,640
Then when will you try?

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
It's not something that can
be done quickly.

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,280
Give me an estimate.

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
-Around--
-How would I know?

101
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
One day, it will happen.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,080
As of now, even though Xiaozi's
the one initiating it,

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,120
but she and Si would meet
two or three times a week.

104
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,880
It seems Si is a bit enlightened.

105
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,920
What about Shancai?

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,920
Does she still bother Si?

107
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,360
The situation is,

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,520
aside from school, Si and Shancai
don't have much contact.

109
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
Though, Xiaozi often talks to Shancai.

110
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
You mean Xiaozi initiates it?

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
What are they up to?

112
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,880
Xiaozi seems quite naive.

113
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
It seems she'll tell Shancai details
about her relationship

114
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,680
with Si.

115
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,960
This girl Shancai
has too many tricks up her sleeve.

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,679
I think she hasn't given up on Si yet.

117
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
This is quite good too.

118
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Try it.

119
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
Open the door.

120
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,320
Shancai.

121
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,280
Xiaozi?

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,160
Why are you here?

123
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,680
What's up?

124
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Who is it?

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
It smells so good. Are you having dinner?

126
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,280
Hi, good evening.

127
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,720
Shancai, is she your friend?

128
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,320
Come, have a seat and eat with us.

129
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Can I?

130
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,000
-Sure.
-Sit down. I'll get you a bowl.

131
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,520
Thank you, Mrs. Dong. This is great.

132
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
I haven't had dinner here before.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
Here.

134
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,400
These are just simple dishes.

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,560
Can I try them?

136
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
Of course.

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
These are delicious.

138
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,560
Come on. Try it.

139
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,120
-Thank you, Mr. Dong.
-You're welcome. -It's delicious.
-Really?

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Then have some more. Try the others.

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
-Here.
-Okay, thanks.

142
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,840
Shancai, why are you standing there?

143
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
Come here.

144
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,720
Okay.

145
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I'll try this one.

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Have some more.

147
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,040
Get some more of this.

148
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,960
Mrs. Dong, you cook so well.

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
You know,

150
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,480
I woke up so early in the morning
to do my makeup and get dressed.

151
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,080
I even took out all my clothes
from my closet.

152
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
That's right.

153
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
I also used a new lipstick color.

154
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,000
I think he never even looked
at my lipstick.

155
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm not sure if he noticed it.

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,560
Shancai.

157
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Are you listening?

158
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Yes.

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
By the way,
I took him to the park for a walk today.

160
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
That park is so romantic, you know?

161
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,360
I think men should make a move
at those moments.

162
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,960
But,

163
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,080
you know, he didn't even kiss me.

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Aside from that,
we just sat there silently.

165
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,560
We're not like lovers at all, right?

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,520
Do I really need to hear her rants?

167
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,480
Shancai.

168
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,400
Have you and Daoming Si ever kissed?

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,600
You have.

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
You have, right?

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
Tell me honestly.

172
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
I...

173
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,400
Tell me.

174
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Does he still like you?

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,680
Don't think like that.

176
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,720
It's not like that.

177
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,120
Sorry, Shancai.

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe I'm too impatient.

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,480
And I've been so sheltered
since I was little.

180
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,120
I've never experienced these things.

181
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,360
I don't know how to handle it.

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,280
I just think that this love is so painful.

183
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm not sure if Daoming Si likes me. Si's fiancée rants to you every night?

184
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,240
She must have ulterior motives.

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,920
No.

186
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,080
I think she's really worried.

187
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,680
Huaze Lei, talk to Daoming Si.

188
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
Tell him to treat Xiaozi better
or else she'd rant to me every day.

189
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
Do you think he'll listen to me?

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,520
We shouldn't interfere.

191
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,600
It's either they get along or they don't.

192
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,160
We can't do anything about it.

193
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,360
That's true.

194
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,000
-But--
-Stop it.

195
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Si can handle his own problems.

196
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,520
I don't intend to know
what happens between them.

197
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,560
But Xiaozi tells me about her
and Daoming Si daily.

198
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,760
I don't want to know.

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Shancai.

200
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,680
Aren't you the last person
who should be involved in this?

201
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,920
In the same way,

202
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,240
I also shouldn't suggest
or encourage Si to be nicer to Xiaozi.

203
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
If I did that,

204
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
people would think I have
ulterior motives.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Do you understand that?

206
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
-Huaze Lei--
-Let's go to class.

207
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,640
Si.

208
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
What?

209
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,880
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

210
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm really going to be mad
if you're so unreasonable.

211
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,440
Why can't I come here?
I'm your girlfriend.

212
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
Can't you be nicer to me?

213
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,680
She doesn't seem like Si's girlfriend.

214
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
I think they're having an argument.

215
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's not stay here.

216
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,640
What do you want me to do?

217
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,560
I want you to kiss me.

218
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Kiss me now.

219
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,800
What?

220
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,960
Do you still like Shancai?

221
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,520
You're always deep in thought
when you're with me.

222
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm not sure what you're thinking about.

223
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,120
But it's irresponsible
to let your girlfriend...

224
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
feel insecure.

225
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
I want proof.

226
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,720
If you don't like Shancai, then kiss me.

227
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,720
Close your eyes.

228
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,600
Didn't you want Si to be nicer to Xiaozi?

229
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,160
You don't need to be worried now.

230
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,200
Why are you so quiet?

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,640
Do you feel upset?

232
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,160
Upset? Who's upset?

233
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,520
I think this is good.
That's what I hoped would happen.

234
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I feel like I'm having

235
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,040
vacations for New Year, summer,
and winter all together.

236
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
No.

237
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,560
That's not enough to describe
my excitement. I should say I'm as ecstatic

238
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,080
as when my mom sold a year's worth
of bento boxes in one day.

239
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm so happy I'm crying.

240
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,920
-Really?
-Why?

241
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,160
You blab nonstop whenever someone
guesses what you're thinking.

242
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,440
I don't.

243
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,640
Don't act like
you're a psychologist, okay?

244
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,720
It'd be great if you're that focused
in class.

245
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,000
Hey.

246
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,960
Your bag.

247
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,680
You kissed her when she asked you to.
What a happy ending.

248
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,760
All right. Great.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,280
Don't ever bother me again.

250
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Just be with Xiaozi.

251
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,360
I wish you'd be together forever.

252
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,440
Hey, Shancai.

253
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,480
What's the matter?

254
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,280
Why is your face all wrinkled?

255
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,080
Is it?

256
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,000
What happened?

257
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,600
I'm so stupid.

258
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,840
I believe anything anyone says.

259
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm too self-righteous.

260
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,960
I ended up being played.

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,400
How funny.

262
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm really a fool.

263
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,240
How can you say that?

264
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,319
That's because you believe
everyone is nice.

265
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,599
After what Li Zhen
and Shunping did to you,

266
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,000
you still forgave them.

267
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
You're that nice.

268
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,119
Is that so?

269
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,960
Of course. I like you...

270
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,599
because of that.

271
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,560
Really?

272
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
Yes. I like you because of that.

273
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,880
It's not too late as long as I find out

274
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,040
at the right time.

275
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Hey.

276
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Shancai.

277
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,280
I need to get back on my feet.

278
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,400
If I think about it,
I'm just going back to being alone.

279
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,960
Let bygones be bygones.

280
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,280
You're not alone.

281
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
You have me.

282
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,960
Qinghe.

283
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Thank you.

284
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,440
Shancai... It's a good thing you're by my side.

285
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
You're like a brother to me.

286
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,200
I'll get going.

287
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
Bye.

288
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,240
Bye.

289
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,840
What?

290
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
Why am I like her brother?

291
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,800
We heard it through the grapevine.

292
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
Fang added more yesterday too.

293
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
Yes, one hundred thousand yuan.

294
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,040
And I've decided to add more this time.

295
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,800
Absolutely.

296
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,320
Members and employees
get the same information.

297
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
Trust me.

298
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,160
Okay.

299
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,920
It seems Dad's investment consulting
work is going smoothly.

300
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,360
I think so.

301
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
The investment return is big.

302
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,720
So your dad put all our savings into it.

303
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,160
-Does it really earn a lot?
-It's a sure win.

304
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,360
Many members earned a lot

305
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,240
and asked me to re-invest
their money again.

306
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,120
It's that good?

307
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,080
What are you doing?

308
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,480
How are things going between you
and Daoming Si?

309
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Nothing's going on.

310
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,560
He already has a girlfriend.

311
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
He has a girlfriend? Who? The one who always visits us, Xiaozi.

312
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,560
Xiaozi?

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Daoming Si is so strange.

314
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,960
He's dating a girl
that came out of nowhere.

315
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,680
It's so infuriating.

316
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,040
Mom.

317
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,320
She came from a well-known family.

318
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm the one who came out of nowhere.

319
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,160
That's not true.

320
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,360
You came from us.

321
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Just look at yourself.

322
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,160
-That's right.
-Look at your sharp nose.

323
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,040
A straight nose and a wide mouth.

324
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
What a coincidence.

325
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
Can we have tea together?

326
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Are you still mad?

327
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
No, I'm not mad anymore.

328
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,480
But I'm warning you.

329
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,640
Don't judge me again.

330
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,040
It's cold. You should wear
something warmer.

331
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
Do you still have class later?

332
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
No. I'm done for the day.

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
This is for you.

334
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,760
What's the matter?

335
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,000
Nothing.

336
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,320
I just feel that it's so cold outside.

337
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,080
But it's warmer to have coffee
with a friend.

338
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,760
It would be better
if we can soak in hot springs.

339
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,320
Do you like hot springs?

340
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,200
You've never mentioned that before.

341
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,400
Shancai is over there.

342
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,560
Let's go.

343
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Come on.

344
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
Shancai, can we join you?

345
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,720
We're not interrupting your date, right?

346
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,440
No, we're not...

347
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,080
This is Huaze Lei.

348
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
We just met coincidentally. He's Huaze Lei?

349
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,640
Come here.

350
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
Hi.

351
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm Si's fiancée.

352
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
My name is He Yuanzi.

353
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,960
Just call me Xiaozi.

354
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,240
This feels so nice.

355
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,600
It's like we're on a double date.

356
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,120
You're talking too much nonsense. Why are you so angry?

357
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,920
Sorry. He's just shy.

358
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,640
It's fine. We're used to it. Earlier, he said he's bored

359
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,080
and wants to go home.

360
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,640
I told him we can just go to a hotel.

361
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,960
He ran away afterward.

362
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,720
I was just teasing him.

363
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
But we kissed already.

364
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,720
We can go further now.

365
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,160
Monkey.

366
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,240
Stop your nonsense.

367
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,040
What's the problem?

368
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
She likes you so much.

369
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
You should be glad.

370
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
That's right.

371
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,840
Shancai thinks so too.

372
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,880
By the way, we have a nice resort hotel
in the mountains.

373
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
You don't have class tomorrow.

374
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
Do you want to go there?

375
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
No thanks.

376
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,520
You two can go alone.

377
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,440
Huaze Lei, we shouldn't be
third-wheeling here.

378
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
-Do you have hot springs?
-Yes.

379
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,720
Our hot springs are the best.

380
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm going then.

381
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,040
All right. It's set then.

382
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,520
Let's go now.

383
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,880
Ma'am.

384
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,440
Any new developments?

385
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,840
Si and Xiaozi will go to the He Group's
Hot Springs Hotel tonight.

386
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,280
Xiaozi is so smart.

387
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,680
She's a fast learner.

388
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,920
But Huaze Lei and Shancai went with them.

389
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,240
How did that happen?

390
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,480
They met at a coffee shop.

391
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,320
Then went to the hot springs
hotel together.

392
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Shancai always lingers around them.

393
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,760
What is she planning to do?

394
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,080
You said Shancai was with Huaze Lei.

395
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,200
Then they all went to the hotel, right?

396
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,440
Yes.

397
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,920
Maybe she thinks

398
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,520
that there's no more hope with Si
so she's now working on Huaze Lei.

399
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
She might give up when she sees how good

400
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,880
Si and Xiaozi are doing.

401
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
Why aren't you eating?

402
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,280
This restaurant is really good.

403
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,800
Look.

404
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,320
I think you two really look good together.

405
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,560
Si, why are you drinking so much?

406
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Lei.

407
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,360
Say something.

408
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,800
-What should I say?
-Anything you want.

409
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,160
Can I soak in the hot springs?

410
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,720
Of course.

411
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,600
Turn right to go to the pool for men.

412
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,600
Shancai, do you want to go too?

413
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,520
They have a lover's pool here.

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,800
There's no need.

415
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,960
By the way, the guy you mentioned

416
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,960
that's quiet and looks dull

417
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,760
is him, right?

418
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
Yes.

419
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,440
She likes him a lot.

420
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,520
I guessed right.

421
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,360
Si.

422
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
Let's soak in the hot springs too.

423
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm not going.

424
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,640
Never mind. I'll go with Shancai.

425
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,400
Let's go.

426
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,520
It feels so nice.

427
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Shancai.

428
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,960
What's the matter?

429
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,760
Nothing.

430
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,160
I was just thinking

431
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,560
that your hot spring is great.

432
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,040
Thank you.

433
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,600
I think we're living our dreams now.

434
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Going to a sauna with a close friend,
having a meal and chatting together.

435
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm so happy now.

436
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,760
I haven't done this for a while either.

437
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
Shancai.

438
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160
It's so good to know you.

439
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,560
By the way, you have to be
a bridesmaid at our wedding.

440
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,200
Me?

441
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
There's no need.

442
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,520
Just enjoy yourselves.

443
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Why not?

444
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
No. You have to be the bridesmaid.

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,040
You know,

446
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,680
when I'm with Si,

447
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,320
I tell myself

448
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,640
that I can't expect him to be
an ordinary boyfriend. Or else, I'd be so disappointed.

449
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,560
But he's actually quite nice sometimes.

450
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,800
He'd be with me if I ask him to.

451
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,280
Shancai.

452
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,440
I know I'm annoying.

453
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,720
If you want to run away,

454
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,280
I'll chase after you.

455
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,680
If you run to Mars,

456
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,600
I'll go there too.

457
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,040
I can't breathe.

458
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,680
I feel so heavy.

459
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,560
I thought I could really
find closure this time

460
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,760
and run away from Daoming Si.

461
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,840
But why does it feel
like I'm getting more involved?

462
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,880
Shancai.

463
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,600
Shancai, what's the matter?

464
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Shancai.

465
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,240
Shancai fainted in the sauna.

466
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
I feel so miserable.

467
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,480
So miserable.

468
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Drink some water.

469
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,920
I have a bad headache.
What happened to me?

470
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,160
You fainted in the sauna.

471
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Get some rest. You'll be fine.

472
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,440
You were the one who brought me here? You saw everything?

473
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,000
I helped you get dressed, didn't I?

474
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,080
You helped me get dressed...

475
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
Then you saw everything
while helping me...

476
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
What else can I do? Can't you ask a girl to help me?

477
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Where's Xiaozi?

478
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
-I want to talk to her.
-Never mind.

479
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,240
Don't interrupt them.

480
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,480
You're right.

481
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,520
You can stop them if you want.

482
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,200
I can help you break down the door.

483
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,960
Why should I stop them?

484
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,600
Because you look like you're going
to cry all the time.

485
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Why did you agree to come here?

486
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,640
You made things so complicated. Why should we be here?

487
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,520
Since we already saw them,

488
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,000
should we just pretend we didn't?

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,880
Si.

490
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,480
Si, did you hear me?

491
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,920
What is it? You're no noisy.

492
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,040
My mom told me to move
to your house next semester.

493
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,120
We can get to know
each other better this way.

494
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,360
It's fine if you want to get
your Master's degree

495
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,400
before we get married.

496
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,560
You're just going to follow
your parents' plan?

497
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,840
Don't you feel such a life
would be so boring?

498
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
What do you mean?

499
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,240
Haven't you already decided to like me?

500
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,680
All right.

501
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,320
I won't ask if you don't want to tell me.

502
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,000
But now...

503
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,760
Thank you, Lei.

504
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,400
For what?

505
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,120
Thanks for saving me in the sauna today.

506
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,040
I just finished soaking
in the hot springs.

507
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,440
Xiaozi screamed saying that you fainted.

508
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,200
What an impatient person.

509
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,040
And very intense.

510
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,520
In some ways,
she's very similar to Daoming Si.

511
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,880
If you think about it,
they're not that similar.

512
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,600
No one can beat Si's personality.

513
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,360
You're right.

514
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,120
You finally smiled.

515
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,040
What do you mean, "finally"?

516
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,520
You were frowning the whole day.

517
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,360
I've been this way since my first day
in Mingde University.

518
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
Not just today.

519
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,400
Is your fighting spirit back?

520
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,679
That's good.

521
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,120
That's the Shancai I know.

522
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,760
You were so sad earlier.

523
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,840
Stop it.

524
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,880
Hit me.

525
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,560
Take it out on me
if that would make you happy.

526
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,040
Who says I'm not happy?

527
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,679
Don't deny it.

528
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,159
Just like on the rooftop before,

529
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,360
Huaze Lei can always calm me down
when I'm most tired and confused.

530
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,240
Daoming Si.

531
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm telling you.

532
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,320
Even though I tease you a lot,

533
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
I'm serious about this.

534
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,200
Don't you feel anything?

535
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,640
No.

536
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Is that so?

537
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,480
Or do you want me

538
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,160
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

539
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,080
I know! You must not like bathrobes.

540
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,200
-Do you like other styles?
-Listen to me.

541
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,520
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

542
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,320
I told you that I'd try to like you.

543
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,800
But I'm really sorry.

544
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,120
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!

545
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,600
What's that sound?

546
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
I think it's from Si's room.

547
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,440
You think Daoming Si
is forcing himself on her?

548
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
I think it's the opposite.

549
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,680
I still want to take a look to be sure.

550
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,360
Xiaozi.

551
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,120
Sorry to disturb you.

552
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,560
You saw something you shouldn't have?

553
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,920
Do whatever you want.

554
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,880
Beat me up until you're satisfied.

555
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,560
Do you know

556
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,000
how much I want to really beat you up?

557
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,640
I want to beat you up until you remember
the pain every time you think of me.

558
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,720
Until you can't ever forget me.

559
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,280
But Daoming Si,

560
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,960
I couldn't bear to hit you.

561
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,240
I don't feel like myself anymore,
you know?

562
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm really sorry.

563
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,120
I couldn't sleep.

564
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,040
I was awake the whole night.

565
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,320
I had the worst timing.

566
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,800
I shouldn't have seen that.

567
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,200
I didn't want to interfere with them.

568
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,520
I feel so miserable.

569
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,400
Good morning.

570
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Good morning.

571
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm becoming more and more clumsy
in front of Daoming Si.

572
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,960
Our boisterous fighting days are gone.

573
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,120
It might be

574
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
because our relationship has changed.

575
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,520
I don't feel awkward with Huaze Lei now.

576
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,720
But if it's Daoming Si,

577
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,720
I wouldn't be able to sleep
while holding hands with him.

578
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,480
What's the matter?

579
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,520
I'm going home.

580
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Tell Lei.

581
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,960
Xiaozi.

582
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,840
I should get going.

583
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,480
Is that so?

584
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,200
I want to stay here longer.

585
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
I'll ask the driver to take you back.

586
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
There's no need. Thanks.

587
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,120
I met Daoming Si earlier.

588
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
He said he was going home.

589
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
Oh, yes. Maybe he's feeling shy.

590
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,160
Since...

591
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,480
Last night, we... He might be feeling shy.

592
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,040
I'll get going then.

593
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,440
Thank you.

594
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,720
Don't you feel anything?

595
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,120
No.

596
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Is that so?

597
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,240
Or do you want me

598
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,800
-to wear see-through stuff?
-Xiaozi.

599
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,200
-I shouldn't be so direct.
-Listen to me.

600
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,520
-I'm not listening!
-Shancai is all I think about.

601
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,320
I told you that I'd try to like you.

602
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
But I'm really sorry.

603
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,200
-I'm not listening!
-I can't be with you!
