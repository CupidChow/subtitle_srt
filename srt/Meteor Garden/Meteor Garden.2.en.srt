00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 2

3
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
I beat the Green Crocodile Pineapple Head.

4
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,080
That narcissist.

5
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,720
As if he scares me.

6
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,720
That girl called Dong Shancai
is quite something.

7
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Si deserved a beating.

8
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,720
Dong Shancai just carried out
the will of the gods.

9
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
Today is worth celebrating.

10
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,200
I'll record it.

11
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,840
This is Meizuo reporting from Egypt

12
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
on an amazing discovery of a mummy.

13
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
There's a bump on his head
from a girl's flying kick.

14
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
What we have here must be
the unluckiest man

15
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,120
in the 21st century.

16
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Lei, do you want a picture with the mummy?

17
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,680
This is the report
of Daoming Si's first knock-out.

18
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,240
How embarrassing.

19
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,360
If I were Si, I'd stop going to Mingde.

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,240
If I were Si,

21
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
I'd disappear from Earth. What time is it?

22
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
What the hell?

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,960
You fainted.

24
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
We brought you back here.

25
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
I remember.

26
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,040
That crazy girl actually kicked me!

27
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm going to knock her head off.

28
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Si.

29
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,200
Did you know that Shancai
was harassed by two guys

30
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
on her way back
after delivering your order?

31
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
What? You saw her?

32
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
Is she okay?

33
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,160
That's why she was angry and kicked you.

34
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,920
You deserved it.

35
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
What does that have to do with me?

36
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,200
Besides, those two guys
must be stupid to pick on her.

37
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,760
Fine. Since you're awake,

38
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,520
we don't have to stay here.

39
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Let's go.

40
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
Hey.

41
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,400
Hey!

42
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,160
Hey, at least untie me!

43
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,880
FOOD NUTRITION CLASSIFICATION STAGE 1,
LI ZHEN

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,600
Hey.

45
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Wow, your notes are incredible.

46
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
I want to be in your group.

47
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,240
Zhen and I did a lot to make this.

48
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,760
Hey, Xinhui.

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,920
Here's the data Zhen and I prepared.

50
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Give me your email addresses
and I'll send them to you.

51
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Hey, Shancai.

52
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,800
You know very well that Xinhui likes Si
and yet you still flirt with him.

53
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,720
No, I didn't.
Xinhui, I'm not interested in him at all.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,760
Hey, Shancai.

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,880
You're the most famous new kid
in Mingde University right now.

56
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,720
First, you attacked the VIP, Mr. Bobbit

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,720
and then you went and kicked
the most popular senior, Si.

58
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,320
You could've done something else
to stand out, right?

59
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,840
That's not Shancai's fault though.

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,200
Who told Si to step on Shancai's phone?

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,600
Actually, it's my fault.

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
I pissed Si off.

63
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,640
It might seem like I'm the bad guy here, but Si basically ruined my life.

64
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,520
He even sent me a Joker card,
challenging me to Poker.

65
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,760
Should I just let him walk all over me?

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
What?

67
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
You actually got a Joker card?

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Why did he give it to you?

69
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Do you even play Poker?

70
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you betting against F4?

71
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,320
When?

72
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640
Where?

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't know. I don't know anything.

74
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,160
But I'm not giving in.

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,920
If the situation becomes worse,
I won't go.

76
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,280
Hey, if you don't want the Joker,
can I have it?

77
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
Do whatever you like.

78
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,160
I can't stand that guy, Si.

79
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Shancai.

80
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,720
Why don't you go after
the guy you like then?

81
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,760
But as a new student in school,

82
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,240
besides getting along with other students,

83
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,360
you should also respect
the school's seniors.

84
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Sorry.

85
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
I interrupted you.

86
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,840
What is it?

87
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
I came to return your handkerchief.

88
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,720
Keep it.

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,159
I don't usually take back
what I've given away.

90
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Also,

91
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,760
I received the Joker card from F4.

92
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,120
Yeah, all the best.

93
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Hey.

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,120
Thank you

95
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,040
for what happened.

96
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
If you hadn't shown up,

97
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,680
I would've been in big trouble.

98
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't misunderstand.

99
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,480
I only freaked out
because I couldn't stand it.

100
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,200
So

101
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,520
can I look for you

102
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,320
at the rooftop again?

103
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
Then I won't go there again.

104
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,400
Hello.

105
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
Ms. Dong.

106
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
Mr. Daoming wants you to get in the car.

107
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
Why should I?

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,160
He wants to see you.

109
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,920
He'd like to pay for your phone
and apologize for what happened.

110
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
You must be kidding.

111
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,400
Ms. Dong, please.

112
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,760
Help!

113
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
What are you doing?

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,080
Who are you guys?

115
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,480
Hey!

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
Help me! That tickles!

117
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,960
Save me!

118
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,520
She has a round face.
An airy bang doesn't suit her.

119
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,960
She's got baby fat.
A center part will make her face look big.

120
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
Stop disagreeing with me.

121
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
It's impossible to make
your face shape nicer, okay?

122
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,200
What are you guys talking about?

123
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,200
-Shut up.
-Quiet!

124
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Let's get on it.

125
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,640
First, I'll cover up the blemishes
on her radiant skin using CC cream.

126
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,440
This is more fashionable. -Fix her bangs.
-Cover the blemishes.

127
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Like that.

128
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,160
Is she done?

129
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,120
Yes.

130
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,280
She looks much better now.

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,200
Ms. Dong.

132
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,840
Please follow me.

133
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Please wait here.

134
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,880
Si will be here soon.

135
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
What does he want?

136
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,120
Don't worry, Ms. Dong.

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Si is a very nice guy.

138
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,760
He won't do you any harm.

139
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,720
Hey.

140
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,720
Could this be F4 when they were younger?

141
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
So Lei has always been cute.

142
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,240
You're finally here.

143
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,640
Where's my phone?

144
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,040
I want to go home.

145
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Hey.

146
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
Do you like Lei?

147
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,920
Listen.

148
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
You can't like Lei.

149
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
Why do you care?

150
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
What is this place? My house.

151
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,800
Why did you bring me here?

152
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,600
And why did you dress me up like this?

153
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Well?

154
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,840
Isn't it nice to be pampered like this?

155
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,400
You know what?

156
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,080
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

157
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,440
No matter where I go, you can be with me
within a one-meter radius.

158
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,880
When I eat, you can sit with me.

159
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Even better,

160
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
you can find me anytime you want

161
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,960
and be with me immediately.

162
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,320
I can take you to and from school
once a week.

163
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,440
I can give you good snacks at school.

164
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,960
I can help you with homework
if you need it. We can go to the best restaurant
in Shanghai on your birthday.

165
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
When we play games,

166
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,400
I'll let you beat me.

167
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,440
We'll take a trip overseas once a year.

168
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Of course,

169
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,640
I can get you a new phone
to replace the broken one.

170
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,840
You must feel really happy now.

171
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,600
Happy?

172
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
You must be kidding me!

173
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
Where are my clothes?

174
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,880
-I want to get changed.
-Hey, you...

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
What are you doing?

176
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,920
Daoming Si.

177
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,760
I'm not sure if you're crazy
or if you're dumb.

178
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't know
why you said all of that to me.

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I don't need your charity
or some special treatment.

180
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,640
I also don't need your money
or a new phone.

181
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,040
I want to go home!

182
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
Hey, listen to me.

183
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,640
You'd better not come back crying.

184
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,080
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

185
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,880
Who do you think you are?

186
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,920
I don't give a damn.

187
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Well?

188
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,520
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

189
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,120
Listen.

190
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,560
I, Dong Shancai, simply won't
date a narcissist like you.

191
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,440
What you just said is as stupid
as your pineapple head.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,120
Goodbye!

193
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,800
He brought me to his house to show off?

194
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
What an unbelievable guy.

195
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,760
But then,

196
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,840
if I could exchange
with anything in the world,

197
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,400
what would I wish for?

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,120
I think I know.

199
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,240
Shancai, you seem
a little different today.

200
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,920
Really?

201
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Is there something on my face?

202
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,680
Your pores are invisible.

203
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,320
And your brows are trimmed.
Did you go to the beauty salon?

204
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
Of course not.

205
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey, I think Si was looking
at you just now.

206
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,160
Whatever.

207
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,560
Did you guys know
that Shancai is infatuated with me?

208
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,440
You mean the girl that
knocked you out with a kick? Hey, stop laughing. You don't believe me?

209
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,120
I believe you.

210
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,880
I knew nobody could say no to my charm.

211
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,480
That girl says one thing,
but means another.

212
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,760
Even I can't say no to Si's angelic charm.

213
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
I have an idea.

214
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
We'll hide in the girls' bathroom

215
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,160
wearing a wig and pretending to be ghosts.

216
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,040
We'll jump out at Shancai.

217
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,920
I bet she'd be scared.

218
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,440
Come on, man.

219
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,839
You're asking us to sneak
inside a girls' bathroom.

220
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
Have you lost your mind?

221
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,800
Then what should we do
inside a girls' bathroom?

222
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,240
First, four guys sneaking into
the girls' bathroom

223
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,680
is already embarrassing.

224
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,599
Also, you're asking us
to pretend to be ghosts.

225
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
We might just end up
looking like perverted ghosts.

226
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,040
Don't worry. We just need to stay alert.

227
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,440
No way. Leave me out of it.

228
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,880
Si just doesn't really understand women.

229
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
Lei.

230
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,320
I won't be a ghost. Forget it.

231
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,000
Si, it's not that hard to hit on a girl.

232
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,120
Who said I'm going to hit on her?

233
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,680
I just want

234
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,680
to pull a prank on her.

235
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,120
Are you sure?

236
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,360
-I won't help you, then.
-It's okay.

237
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,160
Yan isn't a good friend.
I'll help you get her.

238
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,080
That's great!

239
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,160
I said I don't like her.

240
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,760
Sure, you don't like her. Neither do we.

241
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,680
Hey.

242
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,320
What about getting some fake cockroaches

243
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,680
and planting them in her bag tomorrow?

244
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,880
Imagine her opening the bag and...

245
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,400
That's something a child would do.

246
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
What?

247
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,600
Too lame?

248
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
We could buy some onions
and paint them red.

249
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,760
Make them look like they're apples.

250
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,880
Hey, Meizuo.

251
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,920
Give them to her tomorrow.

252
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
She'll be eating it
with tears in her eyes.

253
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,920
I can just imagine it.

254
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,320
Hey, Si.

255
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
We're too busy to be pulling pranks.

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,960
What are you busy with? He forgot.

257
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,840
We need to see the professor
to discuss our graduation project.

258
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,360
Oh, we can go tomorrow.

259
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,240
By the way, Lei,

260
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,960
you're majoring in music.
Why are you coming with us?

261
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm just taking a free ride.
It's more environmentally friendly.

262
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,760
Who can tell me
the nutritional content of a banana?

263
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,480
-No idea.
-Yeah.

264
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,520
I know, sir!

265
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,920
A banana contains calcium,
sodium, magnesium, manganese,

266
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
zinc, potassium, iodine,
selenium, iron, copper.

267
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,760
Vitamins A, C, E, B1, B2.

268
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,240
Protein and dietary fiber.

269
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,600
Excellent.

270
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,600
How did you memorize all that?

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,760
I come from a family of banana farmers.

272
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,400
One year, we had an enormous harvest

273
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,280
so we opened a food processing plant
to make banana cakes.

274
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
The same year, our sales hit the roof.
Then we opened ten more factories.

275
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,720
So does your family often step
on banana peels and fall?

276
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
You're wrong about banana peels.
People don't fall from banana peels.

277
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
A fresh banana peel has friction

278
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,840
and won't cause people to trip.

279
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
Really?

280
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,800
How about a demonstration?

281
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,880
Watch.

282
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,480
Be careful.

283
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
But if the banana peel is not fresh,

284
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,080
you'll easily fall.

285
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,240
-Do it again then.
-Yes, one more time.

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,640
-Do it again.
-Again.

287
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,520
This new batch of Nutrition students
has got some interesting people.

288
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,040
They all have amazing legs.

289
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,040
They can step on banana peel
and kick Si too.

290
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,120
Shut up.

291
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,960
We should go for a visit someday.

292
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,400
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

293
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,160
You received a Joker card
just after you started school.

294
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,880
A flying kick,
an attempt at reconciliation

295
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
and a request to be his girlfriend.

296
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
What a gripping story. Full of ups and downs.

297
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,680
So is that Daoming Si guy
interested in you?

298
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,160
Don't be ridiculous.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,440
He just wants to make my life miserable.

300
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,720
I'll never let him win.

301
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,600
Shancai, don't worry. F4 or whatever,

302
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,560
whoever bullies my friend is a bad guy.

303
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,440
I'll stand up for you if I see them.

304
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,560
Thanks a lot.

305
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,080
But after listening to your stories,

306
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,320
it seems like Si
is the ultimate troublemaker.

307
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,880
Are his friends annoying too?

308
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,760
You could say

309
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,200
that one of them is different.

310
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,480
How so?

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,520
I can't really explain it.

312
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,960
Maybe he's a little less annoying.

313
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,480
A handsome guy. Welcome.

314
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
So you work here on weekends,
Ms. Flying Kick?

315
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
How hardworking.

316
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,680
Just order what you want
and don't disrupt our work.

317
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,440
Hi, Ms. Milk Tea. Hi, how are you?

318
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,640
I want two drinks.

319
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,560
Shancai. Shancai?

320
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Shancai.

321
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
Two drinks.

322
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,480
Yes, two drinks.

323
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,640
Our best-sellers are White Jasmine
and Red Royal Peach.

324
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,440
Which one would you like?

325
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
I'll take both.

326
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,680
Okay.

327
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
I don't remember you liking milk tea.

328
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,200
I don't really like it.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,320
But these drinks have interesting names.

330
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,400
PLEASE PAY

331
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,520
Shancai, who are they?

332
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,880
They're two of the guys in F4.

333
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
Really?

334
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
They're ready.

335
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,880
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

336
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,160
Thanks.

337
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
We're going. Bye.

338
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,280
Bye, Ms. Milk Tea.

339
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,200
Bye.

340
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,120
What?

341
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
Who are they?

342
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,360
He's called Huaze Lei.

343
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,120
The other one?

344
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,360
The other one isn't important.

345
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,800
So he's the one that's different?

346
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,000
Did he come here just to see you?

347
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,720
-Why are you blushing?
-What?

348
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
Where?

349
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm not blushing. Okay.

350
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,440
You're not.

351
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,440
This is Asia.

352
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,160
This area looks like...

353
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,040
Is it Shanghai?

354
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,800
EAST LONGITUDE 2.21 NORTH LATITUDE 48.52

355
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,680
So this place is...

356
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
North latitude of 48.52 degree.

357
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,560
East longitude of 2.21 degree.

358
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,880
Where is that?

359
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
It's Paris.

360
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,760
Do you know the time difference
between Shanghai and Paris?

361
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
I'll check. Seven hours.

362
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,200
Shanghai is seven hours ahead of Paris.

363
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,240
I wish time could fly by faster.

364
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,080
I have a classmate named Time.
I'll tell her to come here now.

365
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Was that not funny?

366
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
You really are a weird girl.

367
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,280
Look. This red bag goes well
with the leather jacket.

368
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,200
Yes.

369
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,360
I heard it's the most
trendy design this year.

370
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Really?

371
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,240
-Bye.
-Bye.

372
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,960
Wow, Shancai.

373
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,760
You got together with Lei quickly enough.

374
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,720
I was just talking to Lei on the rooftop.

375
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
Yeah, right.

376
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,360
Anyone could tell from your smile
that you're in love.

377
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,880
You like Lei, don't you?

378
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,880
We're all classmates. I'll do you a favor.

379
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,400
Lei already has someone he likes
since a long time ago.

380
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,080
Look.

381
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,840
This is the goddess of Mingde,
the senior Teng Tangjing.

382
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,160
Well?

383
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,640
Aren't they a match made in heaven?

384
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
You probably don't know.

385
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,720
Jing will finish her studies
in France and come back here soon.

386
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,560
Shancai.

387
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,280
You're so cute today.

388
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,520
Hey.

389
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,920
Hey, Si.

390
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
It's you.

391
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,040
What happened to your pineapple head?

392
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
What's wrong?

393
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,080
Is it that big of a deal

394
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,920
just because I changed my hairstyle?

395
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,400
Let me tell you.

396
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,440
I wanted to try a new hairstyle.

397
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,120
I didn't change it because of you.

398
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Oh.

399
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
It suits you.

400
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,880
With an incredible face like this,

401
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,480
regardless of my hairstyle,
I still look dashing, don't I?

402
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,320
"Dashing" is used to describe a gentleman.

403
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
And you're not.

404
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,120
How am I not?

405
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Nothing about you is dashing at all.

406
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Are you making fun of me?
Say that one more time.

407
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
I will.

408
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600
Good morning, Shancai.

409
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,240
What are you laughing about?

410
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm laughing

411
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,960
at someone's who is so full of himself.

412
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,120
What are you talking about?
I really am a dashing guy.

413
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
Si.

414
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,440
-Jing is back.
-What?

415
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,440
Jing is back.

416
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,360
Who is Jing?

417
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
Welcome back.

418
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,480
Lei, I'm back.

419
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,680
I've missed you.

420
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,760
That senior, Jing, is so pretty.

421
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,360
Is she the girl Lei likes?

422
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,160
She's clearly
in a totally different league.

423
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,760
I still think it's funny.

424
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,240
This place hasn't changed. But you guys...

425
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,880
After three years,

426
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,920
you're no longer high school students,
but university students now.

427
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Luckily, you guys haven't changed.

428
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm glad.

429
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,680
Hey, the five of us grew up together.

430
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,440
You can say we're childhood friends.

431
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,960
Si hasn't changed.

432
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,200
You're still the jokester.

433
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,400
You're wrong. I'm more amazing now.z

434
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,560
I'm doing my own investment.
I'm paying for my own tuition fees.

435
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,360
That is pretty amazing.

436
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,360
Your sister must be proud.

437
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,520
I haven't seen her in a while. How is she?

438
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,200
She got married last year.
She's moved to England with her husband.

439
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,480
I know you're really close
with your sister.

440
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,080
Without her here,

441
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,920
you must feel very lonely.

442
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,560
Jing, don't worry about that.

443
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,040
There's a girl who's got
all his attention now.

444
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,200
Her name is...

445
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,160
Dong...

446
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,360
-Something...
-Dong...

447
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,760
You two.

448
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,400
You can't compare her to my sister.

449
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,320
My sister is out of her league.

450
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
Lei, why are you so quiet?

451
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,040
Yeah.

452
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,280
You're even more quiet with Jing around.

453
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
I know. He's always been this way.

454
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,400
He becomes really quiet
whenever he's happy.

455
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
He doesn't say a word,

456
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
but his heart beats really fast.

457
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,760
Lei will never change.

458
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,360
Jing, we've grown up.

459
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
So has Si.

460
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,040
Yes.

461
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,200
Unlike Lei,
who's always such an introvert.

462
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,120
Look at him.

463
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,000
He's still the same Lei from the past.

464
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,160
He's still very amusing.

465
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Come on.

466
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,320
Let's have a toast
to the never-changing Lei.

467
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,960
Cheers!

468
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,240
I'm not!

469
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,400
Lei. What's the matter?

470
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
Jing.

471
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,320
Why did you take those vulgar photos?

472
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,840
That's not like you at all.

473
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,680
Is Lei acting like he's jealous?

474
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,280
I think those photos came out pretty well.

475
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,719
Don't you like them, Lei?

476
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't like them at all.

477
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,239
You're not like those vulgar girls.

478
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,560
I knew you cared about me the most.

479
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
That's why I like you the most.

480
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,199
Wow!

481
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,040
-Give me a kiss too.
-Me too!

482
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,159
-Come on.
-One here.

483
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,360
Give us a kiss too.

484
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,560
Come on.

485
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,639
Jing.

486
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,920
Dong Shancai, wake up!

487
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,440
That guy will never belong to you.

488
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,679
Starting tomorrow,
I have nothing to do with F4.

489
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,480
I will study hard
and be my cheerful self as usual.

490
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,080
I'll buy you lunch. My treat.

491
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,200
My mom made me lunch.

492
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,360
-Really?
-Yes. Awesome.

493
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I think we were meant to meet again.

494
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,240
We meet again in this school.
We'll study together.

495
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,520
-Si, I need to talk to you.
-Step aside.

496
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,840
Dong Shancai,
I want to talk to you. Come here.

497
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,680
What's so important?

498
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
It's important that I see you.

499
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,280
Why do you want to see me?

500
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
Do you want to tell me
some weird stuff again?

501
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,320
No, thanks.

502
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
You're free anyway.

503
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,080
Just come with me.

504
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
Who said I'm free?

505
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,040
I have a lot of things to do right now.

506
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,560
Like what?

507
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,520
I am going to eat the lunch my mom made me

508
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,480
with my best friend, Qinghe.

509
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,240
I don't know about you,
but this is my kind of fun.

510
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,080
Rich guys like you won't understand.

511
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I totally enjoy spending time
with Shancai.

512
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
Let's go.

513
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,800
-WHAT DO YOU WANT?
-I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

514
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,080
Mrs. Chen, you're incredible.

515
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,560
Who's Mrs. Chen?

516
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,840
You are.

517
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
Isn't this you?

518
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,920
Do you remember the time
the beehive fell from the tree?

519
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,240
Everyone ran off,
but you dragged me there.

520
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,000
Of course, I remember.

521
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,920
Back then,

522
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,520
-your face swelled up this big!
-You're terrible.

523
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,720
You're awful!

524
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
Listen up, girls.

525
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
A ripe banana peel
will still make people fall.

526
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,160
I still can't pass this damn level.

527
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
Qinghe, are you okay?

528
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,640
Shancai, look.

529
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,920
I got a Joker card too.

530
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,640
I bet F4 members think
I've got the potential

531
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
so they want to be friends with me.

532
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,440
It'd be rude if I don't accept it.
Right, Shancai?

533
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,600
To hell with them.

534
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,720
They're bothering my best friend now?

535
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,440
Shancai, where are you going?

536
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,720
Daoming Si!

537
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,760
What is this?

538
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Tell me if you've got a problem with me.

539
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,760
Why are you bothering my friend?

540
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
What do you really want?

541
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,160
Why?

542
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,320
Are you pissed off
because of that farmer dude?

543
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
"Farmer dude"?

544
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,920
He's my best friend.

545
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,520
I won't let you bother him.

546
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Are you serious?

547
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,440
What's wrong with your taste?

548
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,280
What's so great
about a lame friend like him?

549
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,920
He's a million times better
than an annoying guy like you.

550
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,800
Being with him makes me feel 1,000 times,
10,000 times better!

551
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
Fine.

552
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,880
I wish you two 1,000
and 10,000 times happiness.

553
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,280
Si, thanks for your Joker card.

554
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,800
My mom made me soy milk. You can have it.

555
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,960
Go back and do your research.

556
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,920
Remember.

557
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,320
"Non-fat milk."

558
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,960
QQ MESSAGE FROM DAOMING SI

559
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,880
Look. "Chen Qinghe.

560
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,160
Your Poker game with F4

561
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,400
is arranged for next Monday at 6:00 p.m.

562
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,800
Please prepare yourself and be on time."

563
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,520
Stop! Ignore him.

564
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,760
Hey, Daoming Si.

565
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,520
You'd better stay away from us, jerk!

566
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
Done. Read this.

567
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
Don't be scared, man.

568
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,240
It's an honor to receive the Joker card.
Just be careful not to lose too badly.

569
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
Thanks for your concern.

570
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,360
Shancai, read this.

571
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,800
"Freshmen Chen Qinghe and Dong Shancai
received the Joker,

572
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,400
but too afraid to accept the challenge.

573
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,560
They're nothing, but...

574
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,320
cowards"? Are you blind?

575
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,400
Watch where you're going.

576
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,920
-So sorry.
-I'll let you go this time.

577
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,480
You'd better watch it.

578
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Shancai. Being with Qinghe

579
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,560
makes you 100, 1,000,
10,000 times happier, right?

580
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,360
So you must be really happy now.

581
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,920
Daoming Si.

582
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,520
Why are you picking on us?
Do you really enjoy doing that?

583
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,160
I do.

584
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
It makes me so happy
to see you fall on your face.

585
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,000
Shancai.

586
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,440
You look like you love to eat
all kinds of vegetables.

587
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,840
-No wonder you're called "Shancai."
-Let go!

588
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
What's wrong?

589
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
Go ahead and hit me.

590
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
Si, you're crossing the line.

591
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,400
Have you had enough?

592
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,920
Lei, do you know what you're doing?

593
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,280
Si, enough is enough.

594
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,680
Don't tell me you like this crazy girl.

595
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,000
Stop it.

596
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,000
If you're my friend, let go.

597
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,920
You...

598
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,560
Let go!

599
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,800
-No.
-Let me go! You're hurting me!

600
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,840
If you leave with her now,
don't talk to me ever again.
