00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 3

3
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Don't be mad.

4
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
Si isn't a bad person.

5
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
He's just very immature sometimes.

6
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,560
He can't help himself.

7
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
Jing.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,320
I can do it myself.

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,600
All right.

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,600
I've known Lei for many years.

11
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,040
This is the first time
I've seen him so agitated.

12
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
You must be very important to him.

13
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,560
That's impossible.

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,840
Huaze Lei likes you, Jing.

15
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
I guess.

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Do you like Huaze Lei too?

17
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,280
Your clothes and shoes are wet.

18
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,040
I have some clean clothes.

19
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
You can wear them.

20
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,600
I don't need to change.

21
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Girls should always be clean and stylish.

22
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
Put them on.

23
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,600
Thank you, Jing.

24
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
Those shoes are so pretty.

25
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
Every girl should have
a pair of nice shoes.

26
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,920
They can take you to beautiful places.

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
Shancai, are you okay?

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm fine.

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,960
Are you wearing new shoes?

30
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,000
They look nice.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Jing gave them to me.

32
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,720
Qinghe.

33
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,880
Today was so embarrassing.

34
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Shancai, I'm sorry.

35
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,600
When Daoming Si was picking on you,
I should have punched him.

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,880
No, you can't win against him.

37
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,600
You're not the one he's picking on.

38
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
If he picks on you again,

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,520
I'll never forgive him. I...

40
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,320
I'll start learning taekwondo.

41
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm sorry, Qinghe.

42
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Because of me, you got into trouble.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,320
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,800
It's very challenging to be able
to fight with people like F4.

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,200
Also, I can stand by your side.

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
I think it's meaningful and fun.

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
-Fun?
-Yes, just like Fantasy Westward Journey.

48
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,840
I used to be so weak,
I couldn't beat anyone.

49
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
But you encouraged me,

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,840
now I can even beat
the bosses in the game.

51
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,240
Together, we can beat the whole world.

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,000
So, I worried about you for nothing.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
By the way,

54
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,480
my family has a villa in Sanya.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,880
A villa?

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you want to go there
during the national holiday?

57
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
Do you think I can go with my allowance?

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,320
We're friends. Money's not an issue.

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
Trust me, it's really fun there.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
There's a waterfall and an aquarium.

61
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
My dad was going to take my aunts there,

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
but my uncle...

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
My uncle's kid got married,

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,600
so they canceled.

65
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
It will be just the two of us.

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Shancai.

67
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,760
Shancai, what's wrong?

68
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
Shancai.

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
Help!

70
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Three times a day.

71
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,960
-One pill each time.
-I'm telling you,

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,560
if she doesn't get better,
we still have to pay tuition

73
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
-even if she's not going.
-One pill each time. If she can't go to class, she'll miss out.

74
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
Yeah.

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,040
The tuition is very expensive.

76
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't listen to your mom.

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,000
The tuition is very expensive.

78
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Here you go, sweetheart.

79
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Let me see.

80
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
You're getting better.

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,160
Do I need to take that many pills?

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,400
If you don't take them, you'll get worse.

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,760
Yes, you should listen to the doctor.

84
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
Who is it?

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Shancai, your classmate
is here to see you.

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
Who is it? Qinghe?

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,000
No, it's a tall and handsome boy.

88
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
-Shancai, come here.
-Handsome?

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Let me see how handsome he is.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Am I looking into a mirror?

91
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
He's so handsome and so tall.

92
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,760
You're too kind.

93
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
You didn't have to bring all these gifts.

94
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
How dare you come to my house?

95
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
Dad, Mom, kick him out.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,640
He's Daoming Si,
the guy that made me sick.

97
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,520
Daoming Si? Do you mean that Daoming Si?

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,080
The son of Daoming Feng,
the famous businesswoman?

99
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,000
My mother succeeded
because she worked hard.

100
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Cut out the act.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
You're an immature jerk
who picks on everyone.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,560
I think Shancai
must have misunderstood me.

103
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm here to apologize.

104
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,360
Yes, he's a guest at our house.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,560
Be polite.

106
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,840
Daoming Si, Shancai never thinks
before she talks.

107
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,480
-Please don't be offended.
-Yes.

108
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
We're very honored that you could visit
our humble abode today.

109
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,400
-Yes.
-Please come in.

110
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
-Right here.
-Come in.

111
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
Your house looks small,

112
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,520
but I never thought
that it would be this small.

113
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
That's because you're tall, Daoming Si.

114
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,480
-It's perfect for us.
-Yes.

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,440
Are you done, Daoming Si?
Thank you for visiting.

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,640
The door's over there. You can go now.

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
Daoming Si,

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,440
Shancai still has a bit of a fever.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,720
That's why she's saying rude things.
Please don't be mad.

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,799
Yes.

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,760
We're preparing dinner now.

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
-Yes.
-If you don't mind,

123
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,600
would you be willing
to have dinner with us?

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,600
I think that Daoming Si wouldn't like
eating the normal food we eat.

125
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,160
Our food isn't delicious at all.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,840
If you don't like it
and throw it in my face,

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
my mom will beat you up.

128
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,400
That's nonsense. Do I look mean?

129
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,800
You're the nicest mom I've ever seen.

130
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,040
Yes. I'm really good at cooking.

131
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,200
Why don't you have dinner here?

132
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
I'll have to agree.

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
Wonderful.

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,320
Here. Try my signature dish.

135
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,680
-Sweet and sour pork ribs.
-Thank you.

136
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,320
Look familiar?

137
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,640
You're probably not hungry.

138
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,240
If you don't like it, you can spit it out.

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
You weren't lying. This is delicious.

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,400
What's this?

141
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,840
This is braised minced eel.

142
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,840
It's a classic dish.

143
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Eel?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
Yellow eel.

145
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,400
The dirty, stinky kind
that lives in swamps.

146
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,600
It tastes great.

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
Did you hear that? He likes it.

148
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
-Thank you so much.
-No, I should thank you.

149
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
What? Is there a fish bone in your throat?

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
I told you so many times,

151
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,480
don't laugh when you're eating.
Look at you...

152
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,640
Why are you still here? Get some vinegar.

153
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,280
Have you ever seen a fish bone in an eel?

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
-Then...
-Let's eat now.

155
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
What's she laughing about?

156
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
She...

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,440
She's happy because her classmate is here.

158
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
Right?

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Don't get so worked up.

160
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,400
Let's eat. Have some more.

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
I cooked this for you.

162
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,680
For me? As if I'm not plump enough.

163
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,400
This is the first time
I've seen Daoming Si being so polite.

164
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,160
He ate everything in his bowl.

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I told you to eat it.

166
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,080
What?

167
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
-Are you trying to make me mad?
-Are you mad?

168
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
Thank you for having me.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm full.

170
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,280
It's getting late now. I should head home.

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,640
So soon?
Don't you want to stay a bit longer?

172
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,320
No, it's okay. thank you.

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,880
You're very polite.

174
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,560
Shancai, stop eating.
See your classmate out.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Mom, I have a fever.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,120
You look very healthy. Just walk him out.

177
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
Go.

178
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I...

179
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
Hurry up! It's all his fault.

180
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
Look at what I'm wearing.

181
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
Your parents seem to like me.

182
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Okay.

183
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,160
You're outside now.

184
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
Stop pretending.

185
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,040
What are you trying to do?

186
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm pretending?

187
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
I never lie.

188
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
Stop acting.

189
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Aren't you here to make fun of me?

190
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,640
Now that I'm sick, are you happy now?

191
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
I'm not happy at all.

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,520
Let me see.

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,320
Who gets a fever on a hot day like this?

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
What did you say?

195
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,960
Why did you come to my house?

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
What are you doing

197
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,520
for the seven-day holiday?

198
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,160
Not much.

199
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
I want to go to Hawaii.

200
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,800
Are you interested?

201
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,120
Hawaii...

202
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
The tickets are super expensive.

203
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
Probably around 50 thousand.

204
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,360
50 thousand?

205
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,600
-Do I look like I have that money?
-You don't? I don't even have 500 yuan.
How would I have 50 thousand?

206
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,480
If you don't even have 500,
where are you going?

207
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,400
I'll pay for you.

208
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,560
-Why are you paying for me?
-Because you don't have money.

209
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,160
And you don't have anywhere to go.

210
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,760
Who said I don't have anywhere to go?

211
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,000
Where are you going then?

212
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,960
I...

213
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm going to Qinghe's
family villa in Sanya.

214
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,440
It's big and beautiful.

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,240
You can surf, snorkel,
and eat tons of seafood there.

216
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,320
You're going with Qinghe? That lame guy?

217
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,840
Yes. We've been planning it.

218
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm so glad that during those seven days,

219
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,720
I won't have to see you.

220
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
You...

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,240
You think I want to see you?

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,120
-Best if we don't.
-Bye!

223
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
Bye forever!

224
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
Your house is over there, tiny girl.

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,280
I know.

226
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,480
Si.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,320
Did you go to visit a sick friend?

228
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,240
Who said that?

229
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
I went to say something.

230
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
Just to say something, okay?

231
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,200
You're joking around again.

232
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,200
You mean you went to threaten someone?

233
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
You know what I mean.

234
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
By the way,

235
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,960
this is your packing list
for your trip to Hawaii next week.

236
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,040
You can see if anything's missing.

237
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
Who said I'm going to Hawaii?

238
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
This is so much fun!

239
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,880
I shouldn't have thought of you like that

240
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
-You suck at singing.
-That's not true!

241
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,080
I want to laugh

242
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,320
-And have fun
-And have fun

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,440
We're here at the beach! We're here!

244
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,240
I'm Shancai!

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm Qinghe!

246
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,200
F4 can go to hell!

247
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Say it.

248
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,160
F4 can go to hell!

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,960
-Let's take a picture.
-Okay.

250
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
-What do you think?
-It's beautiful.

251
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,440
This is my family's villa.
Isn't it awesome?

252
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,720
-Can I go in?
-Of course.

253
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,280
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

254
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,720
Look.

255
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,200
The person who sold us this lamp
said Jack Ma has the same one.

256
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Really?

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
It's a very extravagant lamp.

258
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Let me find you a room
with a view of the lamp.

259
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,800
Let's go.

260
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,400
This is the living room.

261
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
It's so pretty.

262
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,280
Right? You can see
the lamp through the window.

263
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,960
So this beautiful house is usually empty?

264
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,040
We rent it out as a bed and breakfast.

265
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,920
See? You can earn extra money
and also make new friends.

266
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
They even have cleaning services.

267
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
-Isn't that awesome?
-It is.

268
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,520
Let me take you to one more place.

269
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,480
Come on.

270
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,119
There are so many yachts.

271
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Look, my family bought one too.

272
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,599
That big?

273
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,800
Is it big?

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,240
It's pretty cool, right?

275
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,560
It must be super expensive.

276
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,760
It's not that one.

277
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,320
It's the one in front of it.

278
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
Want to go on it?

279
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,560
-Sure.
-Let's go.

280
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,760
All aboard!

281
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,080
QINGHE

282
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,280
Why aren't we moving yet?

283
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I don't understand.

284
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
My dad taught me how to do this.

285
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Why isn't it starting?

286
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
Why do I feel like
that person looks familiar?

287
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,440
It's Daoming Si.

288
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Daoming Si?

289
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
Isn't he in Hawaii? Why is he here?

290
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,600
Isn't that F4?

291
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,840
Hey!

292
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,120
Hey!

293
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
Hey!

294
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
Hey!

295
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Let's go.

296
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,280
Let's go.

297
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,120
Daoming Si, why are you here?

298
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,160
Why are you here?

299
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,880
I can go wherever I want on this planet.

300
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
Do I need to have a reason why?

301
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
Is that your family's boat?

302
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Can it go out to sea?

303
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,760
I think you can only go around the pond.

304
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
Who said so?

305
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,160
I went fishing on it one time.

306
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,840
So it's a fishing boat?

307
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,040
Shancai, we meet again.

308
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,240
Jing.

309
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
You're here too?

310
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,320
I was just saying that
these boys are making me bored.

311
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,280
Then, you appeared.

312
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,960
We're having a party tonight.

313
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
You should come.

314
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,640
I wouldn't want to cause trouble.

315
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,400
I'd ruin the atmosphere.

316
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,920
That's not true.

317
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,920
The more, the merrier.

318
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Right, Lei?

319
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,680
Yes, you should come.

320
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Can I come too?

321
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,640
Don't worry.

322
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I'll be there, so Si won't pick on you.

323
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
Come on. I'll do your makeup.

324
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,840
Then we'll pick a dress.

325
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,520
NOW LIVE

326
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
Ximen, are you using Now Live?

327
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
I want to be on it too.

328
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,600
Jing,

329
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,120
you're so pretty. You're pretty too.

330
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
Has Daoming Si made up with Huaze Lei?

331
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,880
I don't think so.

332
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,880
Si is kind of immature.

333
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,840
He hasn't been talking to Lei.

334
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
Ximen and I persuaded Lei to come along.

335
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,760
Don't worry.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,560
Si has always been very impulsive.

337
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
His temper comes and goes quickly.

338
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,320
He'll get over it soon.

339
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,720
As for Lei,

340
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,160
I don't think anything in this world
could make him mad.

341
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,440
Oh, this is a gift for you.

342
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,600
Thank you, Jing.

343
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,280
My birthday is next week.
I invited some friends.

344
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
You should come.

345
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,640
Your birthday?

346
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,760
It must be a huge event.

347
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,080
Don't worry,
I won't invite those girls at school.

348
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,240
-Can I bring my friends?
-Of course.

349
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
As long as they're your friends,
you can bring them all.

350
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,240
-Thank you, Jing.
-Okay.

351
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
Let's get you a dress.

352
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm going to make you so pretty
to surprise everyone.

353
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Why are there so many girls?
Are they your friends?

354
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,920
Bye.

355
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,080
Shancai.

356
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,400
You look so cute like this.

357
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Girls really need to dress up.

358
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,320
Jing has impeccable taste.

359
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,280
Even Shancai looks amazing
with Jing's help.

360
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,880
Right, Si?

361
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,280
Si!

362
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
You're exaggerating.

363
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
She looks fine.

364
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,680
Shancai.

365
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,560
You look really pretty today.

366
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
I...

367
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,480
I have a stomachache. Wait.

368
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,760
NOW LIVE

369
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,280
Gosh.

370
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,720
I was wondering who tackled me.

371
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,880
It was you.

372
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,400
You almost knocked my teeth out.

373
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Hey.

374
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
What kind of expression is that?

375
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,000
Was that...

376
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Was that your first kiss?

377
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Oh my god,

378
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
I have the worst luck.

379
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,360
I can't believe I gave
that pineapple head my first kiss.

380
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,200
Shancai,

381
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,800
do you take this man as your husband

382
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,960
and whether rich or poor,

383
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,440
in sickness and in health,

384
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,840
you will remain faithful to him?

385
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
I do.

386
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,640
I do.

387
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
I don't!

388
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,920
Let go of me!

389
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Let go!

390
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,520
There's a lot of people on the beach.

391
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,200
Hey, Shancai.

392
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,360
Why are you so weird today?

393
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,040
Am I?

394
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
Have a drink.

395
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,040
Hey.

396
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,360
First kiss Shancai.

397
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,640
Don't call me that.

398
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,200
What first kiss?

399
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,000
She and Si kissed last night.

400
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,280
What?

401
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
Shancai, is that true?

402
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,640
I... Of course, it is.

403
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,280
I'm sure she's been waiting
so long for this.

404
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,000
She tackled me and gave me her first kiss.

405
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh my god.

406
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,400
Really?

407
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,280
No.

408
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
It was dark. I couldn't see anything.

409
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,760
-That's why--
-You don't need to explain.

410
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
I don't care who you kiss.

411
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,200
Shancai.

412
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
Shancai, wait!

413
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,640
Wait for me!

414
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,320
Daoming Si! You stole
Shancai's first kiss, you jerk!

415
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,520
Come out. I'm going to kill you.

416
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,080
Stop hiding in there like a coward!

417
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Come on!

418
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,920
Didn't you give me a joker card?

419
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,880
I'll take the challenge now.

420
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
Come out now.

421
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,800
You're a bully. Open the door.

422
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,600
You're trash. You're garbage!

423
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,760
You're such a lame guy.

424
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,160
The joker card is for Bridge.

425
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,960
Cut out the crap.

426
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,000
Let's start the game.

427
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
Are you scared?

428
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,360
Scared?

429
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,120
Let's do it.

430
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
If I win...

431
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,960
-I'll admit that you're better than me.
-That won't be enough.

432
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,000
If I win, you can't stand next
to Shancai anymore.

433
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,960
Fine.

434
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,080
-What if I win?
-You can't stand next to me.

435
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,120
Okay.

436
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,800
This is your family's boat?

437
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Why is it so small? And why is it so shaky?

438
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
It's to cut down on carbon emission.

439
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,640
Lame people

440
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,480
are never willing
to admit how lame they are.

441
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,760
-Are you talking about me or Shancai?
-You're the same.

442
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,000
It's fine if it's me,

443
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,120
but if it's Shancai,

444
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
I won't forgive you. But it's true.

445
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,640
She's a girl,

446
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,400
but she's rude and short-tempered.

447
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,280
She dresses terribly.

448
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,840
Most importantly, she's stupid.

449
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,080
You don't know Shancai.

450
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,480
You don't know how great she is.

451
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,280
How is she great?

452
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,120
You don't know

453
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,960
how cute Shancai was
before she came to Mingde.

454
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,520
In high school,

455
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,320
one time, class funds went missing.

456
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
SHAME

457
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,840
In order to find the culprit,

458
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,800
the teacher made us stay after school.

459
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,360
It must have been someone in this class.

460
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,400
Does nobody want to admit to it?

461
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
Fine.

462
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,920
You're all so smart.

463
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,560
Take out a piece of paper

464
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,720
and write down
who you think stole the money.

465
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
The three classmates
with the highest votes

466
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,280
will be the culprits.

467
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,560
Sir, you can't make us
do this to our classmates.

468
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,040
Shancai.

469
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
Could it be you then?

470
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Sir,

471
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,560
you shouldn't make us vote.

472
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,240
Our classmates aren't thieves.

473
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,640
We'll just find the money.

474
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,160
Let me check your book bags!

475
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,360
We won't.

476
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,800
You...

477
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
You...

478
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
-Sir.
-What?

479
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
Can I go to the restroom?

480
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,280
Shancai, you're so cool.

481
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,840
Why are you crying?

482
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,120
Stop crying.

483
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,480
I think you're cool too.

484
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,760
But this is so embarrassing.

485
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,560
-It's not embarrassing.
-I really just want to pee.

486
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,239
From that day on, I swore that

487
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,920
I would never let anyone pick on Shancai.

488
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,480
Whoever picks on her,

489
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,920
picks on me.

490
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,960
Why does your story

491
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,199
sound so familiar?

492
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,239
I feel like I've heard it before.

493
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,080
Hey.

494
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,719
Did you steal that story from a movie?

495
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,159
It's a real story, okay?

496
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
That year,

497
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,040
Shancai became Mrs. Chen.

498
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
What? Mrs. Chen?

499
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,840
What the hell are you talking about?

500
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,360
In Fantasy Westward Journey.

501
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,880
Look, this is Shancai's handle.

502
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,639
In the game, our intimacy level

503
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,639
has gone up to 9,999.

504
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,520
I have a screenshot
of when we got married.

505
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,600
Are you stupid or something?

506
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,760
You're just jealous that we're so close.

507
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,920
What was I expecting?

508
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,960
What's that?

509
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
None of your business.

510
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,120
What are you doing? What the hell is this?

511
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,200
-Why is it so spicy?
-It's spicy, isn't it?

512
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,840
No.

513
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
I think it's good.

514
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
I think I got something.

515
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,840
Hey.

516
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,800
See? I told you I was a genius.

517
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm good at everything.

518
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
It's just one catch.

519
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,120
Are you that proud?

520
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,760
I wasn't even trying.

521
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,000
Hey.

522
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
I clearly won.

523
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,920
Look at my bucket.

524
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
So?

525
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,160
I won.

526
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,080
What did we bet on?

527
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,960
You can't stand next to me.

528
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,000
What?

529
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,480
You...

530
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,800
What kind of bet is that?
Do you think I'm stupid?

531
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
-You are stupid.
-You...

532
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,640
You... What?

533
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,400
Shancai is special to you, isn't she?

534
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,800
Why do you care about her?

535
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,080
Do you like her?

536
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,240
I thought so when you saved her
at the restaurant.

537
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,280
To be honest,

538
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm kind of jealous.

539
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,720
Because you're no longer mine.

540
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,800
So, what are you trying to say?

541
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,640
Do I think both of you are alike?

542
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,040
Lei.

543
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,040
Stop lying.

544
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,080
You care about everyone.

545
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,360
You try so hard to maintain
the image of a princess.

546
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,520
Even if someone gets hurt
because of your indecisiveness,

547
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,920
you don't care.

548
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
I don't want to be manipulated
by you anymore.

549
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,520
Lei, that's not what I mean.

550
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,480
You say I care about Shancai...

551
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,600
The truth is,

552
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,320
I only care about you.

553
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
There's no need to feel sad.

554
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,160
He's so great.

555
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,480
He's supposed to be with Jing.

556
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,920
But...

557
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,840
Why do I feel so sad?

558
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,160
Shancai,

559
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,640
you're so cute today.

560
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,720
When you feel like crying, do a handstand.

561
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,120
That way, your tears won't fall down.

562
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,520
What?

563
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,120
Why are you like this?

564
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,560
What should I be like?

565
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm forcing you,

566
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,480
why aren't you resisting?

567
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,000
I didn't realize that
you're already a man.

568
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,040
Now I realize it.

569
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,000
What?

570
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,640
-Hold this.
-Why?

571
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,400
DAO

572
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,440
That's how you do it.

573
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Shancai?

574
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,960
Shancai,

575
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,400
why are you here alone?

576
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,640
Why are your eyes red?

577
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Were you crying?

578
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,480
No, it's just really windy here.

579
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,600
Some sand got into my eyes.

580
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,720
Why are you guys here?

581
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,000
To get revenge for you,

582
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,960
I challenged Daoming Si to squid-fishing.
He lost by a lot.

583
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,760
Look.

584
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,160
Hey.

585
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,680
Are you proud of being good
at squid-fishing?

586
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,160
I remember someone
couldn't even get the squid off the hook.

587
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,320
It's really hard, okay?

588
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
They have so many tentacles.

589
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,720
And they suck on to it really hard.

590
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,880
Hey, why are you blushing?

591
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,200
-You...
-I...

592
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,600
What's the matter with you?

593
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
You pervert!

594
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,680
You're thinking
about that kiss, aren't you?

595
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,160
It's none of your business.

596
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,640
You can't stand next to me anymore.

597
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,040
You're the one standing next to me.

598
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,080
You're so petty.

599
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,120
Dong Shancai, say something
about your rude friend.

600
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,240
Come at me then.

601
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,680
-You...
-I'm going to kill you.

602
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,800
-Get back here.
-No!

603
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,720
Stop it.

604
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,680
I...

605
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,320
I'm going to get you.

606
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,440
Even though I hate to admit it

607
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,760
on this cold and sad night,

608
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,720
my worst enemy

609
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,360
brought me back to the warmth of life.
