A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 36

3
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,760
Hey.

4
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,920
What are you doing outside?

5
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,480
I...

6
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,280
I came out for some air.

7
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Me too.

8
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Well, I'll go inside then.

9
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
Shancai.

10
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,520
Can you give me a hug before you go?

11
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
Just one time.

12
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,000
You're so petty. Can't it be twice?

13
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,279
If I don't set a limit,
you'll keep on hugging me.

14
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,520
Come here.

15
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
You got it.

16
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Five more times.

17
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,760
Last night, after giving 100 hugs,

18
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,480
I couldn't sleep the whole night.

19
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,400
I wasn't like this when I was a cleaner
at his house.

20
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,400
Why am I frying two eggs?

21
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
Don't I usually just have one egg?

22
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,160
That silly Daoming Si

23
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,560
just simply entered into my world.

24
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,200
If I don't take care of him,

25
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,200
I'm not sure how bad he'll end up.

26
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
He's so childish.

27
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,640
That's strange. Why is the door open?

28
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,400
This guy is so stupid.
He didn't close the door last night.

29
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
Turns out he wasn't home.

30
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,640
I never thought you'd live
in such a place for Shancai.

31
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,760
The power of love is so scary.

32
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
This can be a classic tutorial
in Ximen's Love Lessons.

33
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
A tutorial of what not to do.

34
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
The ceiling's so low and it's old.

35
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,040
Won't you hit your head when you stand up?

36
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,520
Won't your legs hit the wall
when you stretch them out?

37
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm really a supermodel.

38
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,920
That's why I couldn't
sleep well all night.

39
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,480
That's really not the point, okay?

40
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,960
You don't get it.

41
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,560
A place with cockroaches is really cool.

42
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
I really like it.

43
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,440
I never thought
he'd endure all that for me.

44
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,360
He even said that he liked
this kind of life with a smile.

45
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,080
Daoming Si, why are you so good to me?

46
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
I feel so guilty.

47
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,040
You're saying a place like that
with Shancai is really cool, right?

48
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,960
You're out of line.

49
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,080
You're changing my concept.

50
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,480
Which concept?

51
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,760
Shancai is a weed.

52
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
She's definitely not a cockroach.

53
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,000
She is my little white pig.

54
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,800
Then did you hug your little white pig
last night?

55
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,040
Here, piggy.

56
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,440
Tell the truth.

57
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,440
What happened last night?

58
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
You're too concerned about me.

59
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
You ask me personal questions
in school every day.

60
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,160
You're the one who asked us to come here
and think of a plan.

61
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,760
Okay. You're a good friend.

62
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,760
All right. I'm going home for a nap.

63
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
Ximen.

64
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Are you seeing Xiaoyou lately?

65
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
How do you know?

66
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
Are you stalking me?

67
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,080
But...

68
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
an innocent girl like Xiaoyou
is not your type, right?

69
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,640
Don't worry. I didn't do anything.

70
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,600
I just took her to a hotel.

71
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,600
What? They went to a hotel?

72
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Shancai.

73
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
Do you think this lipstick color suits me?

74
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,760
I think this suits you better.

75
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,200
Okay. I'll use the Coral Fauve color then.

76
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,280
Aren't you afraid Shancai will punch you?

77
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,880
Shancai? Is she her mom or guardian?

78
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,520
Why is she interfering with her life?

79
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,000
Be good.

80
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,280
Don't worry. I know my limits.

81
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,320
Hey, Ximen.

82
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
Oh, it's you Shancai.

83
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,280
I have something to tell you.

84
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
How is it?

85
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,880
Do you like living so closely with Si?

86
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,360
What do you mean?

87
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,680
Daoming Si just rented the place
next door.

88
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,120
That's still a step further than before.

89
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,120
That means he finally gets it now.

90
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,160
By the way, he went home already.
I'll get going.

91
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,840
Hey, wait.

92
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,720
Ximen.

93
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,520
If you're not serious about Xiaoyou,

94
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
please stop now.

95
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,640
I heard you went to a hotel.

96
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,120
Is that true?

97
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,600
Shancai.

98
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,640
-Qinghe likes you, you know?
-Qinghe...

99
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,640
Don't joke about that. I'm just showing you an example.

100
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
Qinghe likes you, but you like Si.

101
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,960
He's well aware of that.

102
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,560
But he still told you,
"Shancai, I'll wait for you to come back."

103
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,520
What would you do if it were you?

104
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
I...

105
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,960
I'll always be his good friend.

106
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,840
I won't date him even if I'm single.

107
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
That's right.

108
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,040
That's exactly how Xiaoyou is to me.

109
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,360
So don't worry.

110
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,800
Then...

111
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,160
-You promise you won't do anything to her?
-I won't make any promises.

112
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,360
-You don't have the right to ask me that.
-Then you'll do something to her?

113
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,360
What do you mean?

114
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
You're so cunning. You know what I mean.

115
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,240
I won't do whatever it is you're thinking.

116
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
That means you promise...

117
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,640
No, you said you won't promise anything.

118
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,880
Then will you or won't you?

119
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,880
Hey. Hey.

120
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Why is it so quiet over there?

121
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,520
Is Daoming Si not home?

122
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,720
What's happening to me?

123
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,120
Why is he all I can think of?

124
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,920
I get more anxious when I think of him.

125
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
Hey.

126
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,600
What? You're like a ghost.
Are you trying to scare me to death?

127
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,760
How dare you call me a ghost.

128
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,440
You stare at me with those big eyes.
You walk without a sound.

129
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
What else should I call you?

130
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,640
Good thing I have a strong heart.

131
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,200
Or else I'd be scared to death.

132
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,360
You're the scary one.

133
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,440
It's the middle of the night
but you're sitting alone by the door.

134
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
The bugs are bothering me, okay?
I couldn't sleep with all the noise.

135
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,319
That's right.

136
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,280
This kind of old house has a lot of bugs.

137
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,760
And termites. And cockroaches.

138
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
So why are you staying here?

139
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,440
Isn't it more comfortable
at your own house?

140
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,800
What do you care? I rented this place.

141
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,480
I can come and go whenever I want.

142
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,760
Don't force yourself anymore.

143
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
This is not a place you like staying at.

144
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
Who says I don't like staying here?

145
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,440
I like to battle with the cockroaches.

146
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,640
Can't I do that?

147
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Daoming Si.

148
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
We're not part of the same world.

149
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,440
Don't force yourself to stay
in such a lousy place for me.

150
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
I feel more miserable that way, you know?

151
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,880
Shancai.

152
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,440
You care about me.
That's why you're saying this, right?

153
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,640
Of course not.

154
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm saying...

155
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
can you not enter my world so easily?

156
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,160
We both know

157
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,440
that this relationship
would not have a happy ending.

158
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
The deeper I fall,

159
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,560
the more anxious I get.

160
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
I'm such a fool.

161
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,560
You're stupid too.

162
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,400
Stupid?

163
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
How dare you say I'm stupid.

164
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,600
If you're not stupid, why did you
fall for a person like me?

165
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm truly stupid for loving someone

166
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
who is stupider than me.

167
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,040
Did you feel lonely because I'm not here?

168
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Stop thinking so highly of yourself.

169
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,680
Actually, I've been coming at 1 a.m.
and going back at 5 a.m. all this time.

170
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
You just didn't know it.

171
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,400
Liar.

172
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Why would I lie to you?

173
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,240
It's more dangerous at that time.

174
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,160
Don't thieves come
in the middle of the night?

175
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,680
And our bodyguards are keeping
a tight watch.

176
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
My every move is under surveillance.

177
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,680
Then wouldn't your mom soon find out

178
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,920
that you've been coming here?

179
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,080
That's why I leave
in the middle of the night.

180
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,320
And I don't dare take my car.

181
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
I just hail cabs.

182
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
What's wrong? It's fine.

183
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,880
I...

184
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,680
So that's what you've been doing.

185
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,520
I'm really stupid.

186
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm throwing a fit here
in the middle of the night.

187
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,640
It's so embarrassing.

188
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm so sleepy.

189
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,800
It's late. You must be tired, right?

190
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
Go home and get some rest.

191
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Okay.

192
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
I'll go back to bed then.

193
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,200
Good night.

194
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
Good night.

195
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,000
Daoming Si.

196
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,120
You can't sleep,

197
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,520
right?

198
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm so high-maintenance.
Of course I can't sleep.

199
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,840
If you're afraid

200
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
to sleep alone...

201
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,120
I'll sleep with you.

202
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,960
Are you sure you want to sleep with me?

203
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,000
Don't worry.

204
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,640
I won't do anything to you.

205
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,040
You're not worried.

206
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,040
But I'm worried.

207
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,800
Last time when you came back from London
and slept at my house,

208
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
didn't we also sleep together?

209
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
This is not the first time.
Why are you making such a big fuss?

210
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,040
I'll just lay down beside you
until you fall to sleep.

211
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
Why are you looking at me?

212
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,640
Because I want to. Can't I?

213
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm warning you.

214
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,640
Don't get any weird thoughts.

215
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,040
I'm just sleeping beside you
like your mom when you were little.

216
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,560
My mom

217
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,880
slept beside me like this. -What are you doing? Let go.
-No.

218
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,160
-Let go.
-No.

219
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,200
You can't sleep, right?

220
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,600
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

221
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Lullaby

222
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,800
and good night

223
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,280
-Now the daytime--
-All right. Stop singing.

224
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,000
Why?

225
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,720
Is my voice too nice

226
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,160
that you can't take it?

227
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,200
It's not only nice. My ears feel plugged.

228
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
Do you want me to unclog them?

229
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,320
"Unclog"? Do you think I'm a sewer?

230
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,280
Okay. So are you sleeping or not?

231
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,680
Good night.

232
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,320
Daoming Si.

233
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,040
What?

234
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,160
Thank you.

235
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm so happy today.

236
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,360
Because even though our lives
are so different,

237
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,920
and we're not part of the same world,

238
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,920
you...

239
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,680
try so hard to be a part of my world

240
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,960
in order to adjust to me.

241
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,280
Even though I've already decided
to be with you against all odds.

242
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,520
But...

243
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,800
actually, I feel so anxious about it.

244
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,040
I feel so confused and tired

245
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,840
thinking about the problems

246
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
we have to face.

247
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,760
Don't think too much.
Everything will be all right.

248
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,520
Shancai.

249
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
I want to turn around and hug you.

250
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
I'm turning around now.

251
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,240
She can even sleep in this situation.

252
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
What a stupid girl.

253
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,640
Aren't you afraid I won't be able
to control myself?

254
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,160
Zhuang, you're back?

255
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,040
What's with the bodyguards?

256
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,760
I just left for a while and everything
fell into chaos?

257
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,040
Mrs. Yu, what exactly happened?

258
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,760
These days,

259
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,240
Si leaves in the middle of the night
and returns in the morning

260
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
in order to be with Shancai.

261
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,120
The President threw a fit
after she found out. And sent bodyguards to watch him.

262
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,120
She's way out of line!

263
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,640
Does she plan to use the tricks

264
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,320
she used on me to separate Si and Shancai?

265
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,560
Hasn't she done enough?

266
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,880
Zhuang.

267
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,560
You know the President's temper very well.

268
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,520
No.

269
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,360
I can't let her do this.

270
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,160
Where's Si?

271
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
Upstairs in the bedroom.

272
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Scram.

273
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,200
Youngsters nowadays,
have really great skills.

274
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,320
Si must have gotten out
from that window over there.

275
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,800
Should we continue pretending
Si's in this room

276
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
for the benefit of the bodyguard outside?

277
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,800
Si, get up!

278
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,480
Your sister's back.

279
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,200
Wake up and chat with me.

280
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,960
Wake up!

281
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,440
Mom, I just came back
from the property office.

282
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,160
Yes.

283
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,320
I have already added more locks
on the doors.

284
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,440
Don't worry. I'm fine.

285
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,280
You and Dad take care too.

286
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,120
Bye.

287
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,240
Yes. Shancai's not home yet.

288
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
I'll continue monitoring her.

289
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
Please don't worry, ma'am.

290
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,720
Hello?

291
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,280
Hello, Daoming Si.

292
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,800
-Where are you now?
-I'm almost there.

293
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,840
Why? Do you miss me?

294
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,040
In your dreams.

295
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
Your bodyguards are in front of my door.

296
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,920
Go to the corridor entrance.

297
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
What should we do?

298
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,080
Don't worry. We'll think of something.

299
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,840
How about going to Ximen
or Meizuo's house?

300
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,280
No. Their houses must be
under surveillance too.

301
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,720
What should we do?

302
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,920
We can't stay out on the streets, right?

303
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,640
How about going to a hotel?

304
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
What? Hotel?

305
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,720
What's wrong? No.

306
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,000
We need to check in hotels.

307
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,160
Your mom would find us sooner there.

308
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,720
Then let's go somewhere
even better than a hotel.

309
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,840
Hey.

310
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,280
-Isn't this your house?
-Lower your voice.

311
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
Of course I know it's my house. What are you planning to do?

312
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,920
Why are you staring at me like that?

313
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,280
Don't you know?

314
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,880
The most dangerous place is the safest.

315
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,440
Will this work?

316
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,360
I have my ways.

317
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,120
I'll distract the head bodyguard.

318
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,800
Try sneaking in from the back door.

319
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,600
How do I get in?

320
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,120
There's a key to the back door
that only the F4 know about.

321
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,720
I feel like I'm sneaking
into a military base.

322
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,240
I hope we succeed in our mission.

323
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,040
Si, weren't you inside the bedroom?

324
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,800
I went to the convenience store earlier.

325
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,000
When?

326
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,080
What do you care?

327
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,560
Hey. You took a really long shower. This shirt is really big.

328
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,920
Stop laughing.

329
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,360
You're so loud.
What if the bodyguard hears you?

330
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,600
Why are you staring at me?

331
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,840
Why? Can't I stare at your beautiful face?

332
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,160
Come and sleep with me.

333
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

334
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
-I...
-With me,

335
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
you have to sneak around

336
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,160
and you'll be under a lot of pressure.

337
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,840
You risk being judged

338
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,720
and bullied.

339
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,760
Because of this, are you so afraid
that you want to give up?

340
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
That's right.

341
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Yet I have to sneak into your house

343
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,400
in the middle of the night.

344
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm also thinking why loving someone
has to be so hard.

345
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,480
Why should I torture myself this way?

346
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
However...

347
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,760
Your determination and perseverance
moved me.

348
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,080
I'm not able to hate you.

349
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Maybe we need to experience
these hardships

350
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,320
and pay the price

351
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,680
so that we'll treasure
our relationship even more.

352
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,040
Shancai. Let me ask you something.

353
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,640
Have you done it with Daoming Si?

354
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Done what?

355
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,160
Have sex.

356
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
Xiaoyou, what are you saying?

357
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,680
You haven't?

358
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,640
I thought liking someone means

359
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,120
giving him everything you can, right?

360
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,040
I think it's a natural thing.

361
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,280
Si, you're home...

362
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,160
Zhuang.

363
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
Why didn't you knock?

364
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,360
When did you become such a scumbag?

365
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,880
Forcing a girl to go to bed with you?

366
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,520
No, Ms. Zhuang. You've misunderstood.

367
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,400
Daoming Si didn't force me.

368
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,560
What?

369
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Really?

370
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,720
Really.

371
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,040
Goodness!

372
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,400
You and Si are already at this level?

373
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm so happy I want to cry.

374
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,480
Then why were you being
so harsh on me just now?

375
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,480
Ms. Zhuang, I should have told you sooner.

376
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,520
But...

377
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,800
You've made such a huge decision.

378
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm so happy.

379
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,400
Thank you, Shancai.

380
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Ms. Zhuang.

381
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,000
Did I...

382
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,880
ruin your plans?

383
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
What do you think?

384
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,600
But Si.

385
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,520
This kind of thing
is very meaningful to girls.

386
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
You can't rush it.

387
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,440
You have to be with Shancai
and protect her

388
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,720
every day from now on.

389
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,600
You can't let her get hurt.

390
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,000
Why do you need even to say that?

391
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,440
Of course I--

392
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,120
Who said you can talk back to me?

393
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,680
Can't you let me finish?

394
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,120
I was saying I know I'd only be
with Shancai in this life.

395
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,920
So I'm willing to wait no matter
how long it takes.

396
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,560
Good!

397
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,440
You're really my brother.

398
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Zhuang.

399
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,600
Can't you hit your brother
a little bit softer?

400
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,720
Lower your voices.
The bodyguards are outside.

401
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
I can't believe you'd choose to stay here.

402
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,760
What a good idea.

403
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,880
Leave the bodyguards to me.

404
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,000
You two...

405
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,280
can continue.

406
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,400
Shancai.

407
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,400
When can we go further?

408
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,800
-In five years.
-Five...

409
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
years?

410
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,240
Are you kidding me?

411
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,280
Fine.

412
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,880
I'll wait.

413
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,680
Daoming Si has a lot of sides to him.

414
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,440
The childish side. The adolescent side.

415
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,160
The gentleman side.

416
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,240
I'll work hard to accept
all his different sides.
