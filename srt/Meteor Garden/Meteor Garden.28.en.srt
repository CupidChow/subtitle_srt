00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 28

3
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
My goodness.

4
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,440
This gift is a little too...

5
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Why do you need to go home so soon?

6
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
I'm meeting a designer.

7
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,000
What designer?

8
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,680
The one my dad chose
to renovate our old house.

9
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,880
Oh, right.

10
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
You know him too.

11
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,760
Who is it?

12
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Ye Mingchuan. Terence.

13
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,080
-The old handyman?
-Yes.

14
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,160
So you're Mr. Ye, the designer.

15
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,160
It's good to see you again.

16
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,280
I hope you'll forgive me

17
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
if I had been rude.

18
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
No worries.

19
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,320
Sorry for making you wait.

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Caina and I

21
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,600
were having a wonderful date just now.

22
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Really?

23
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,440
Was it even more wonderful
than one we had that night?

24
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,760
I heard that you often
travel around the world

25
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,680
to find inspiration for your designs.

26
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,720
I bet you have had many girlfriends.

27
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
You're too humble.

28
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,800
F4 is a reputable group.

29
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,040
We're well known indeed,

30
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,920
but we never have flings
while being away on vacations.

31
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,760
That one fling

32
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
might just be the love of your life.

33
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
But there's also a 99 percent possibility
that it'd just be a forgettable chapter.

34
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
It's too bad that the 99 percent

35
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
isn't in my control.

36
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
Then who's controlling it?

37
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,240
I don't care who is controlling it.

38
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,480
What matters is you're in my hands.

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Caina.

40
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,080
These are some design plans
I came up with.

41
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
Which one do you prefer?

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Okay. I'll take a look.

43
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,960
Why don't we post
a search notice on Weibo?

44
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,880
If we do that,
people will know that Shancai is missing.

45
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,640
Do you think Daoming Si's mom
really took her away?

46
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
I asked my dad to check on that.

47
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Mrs. Daoming is away
doing business in London.

48
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,920
She's too busy to care about Shancai.

49
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
That's because she's taken care of it.

50
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,200
Remember,
Mrs. Daoming is a meticulous person.

51
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
Let's calm down.

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,280
Shancai must have her own reasons.

53
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
Check your phones.

54
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
She'll try to contact us if she can.

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm such a useless friend.

56
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
Shancai is always the one protecting me.

57
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,160
Now that she's missing,
I don't know how to help her.

58
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't worry, Xiaoyou.

59
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,160
It's okay.

60
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,440
Shancai will be fine.

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll protect you too.

62
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,120
Why do you need to protect her?
I can do that too.

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,040
If you could do that,
Shancai wouldn't be missing.

64
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,080
It's all Daoming Si's fault.

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't try to stop me.
I'm going to make him pay.

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,440
Why isn't anyone stopping me?

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
Don't be too depressed.

68
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
I have a hunch

69
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
that she's doing just fine.

70
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,400
Why?

71
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,480
Did you guys forget? She's Shancai.

72
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,480
I can't accept it.

73
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,320
You're leaving me because
of such a lousy reason.

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,080
That's nonsense!

75
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,640
Shancai.

76
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Do you really think I'm a useless guy?

77
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Forget about my family, my mom

78
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
and everything else.

79
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,760
Have you ever thought of me
as a worthy guy?

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,960
I...

81
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
am...

82
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,560
sorry.

83
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,880
I'M SORRY

84
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,560
So what if I feel sorry?

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
It's not like he could read this.

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
What are you doing here alone?

87
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,760
Let's go home.

88
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
Your dad's coming back
with his boat tonight. I thought Lei suddenly got a face change.

89
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,640
What's wrong with you lately?
Are you becoming like Daoming Si too?

90
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,880
Did Caina go missing too?

91
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Shut up.

92
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,760
It looks like

93
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,960
you gave up fighting with that old dude.

94
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,320
A few days ago,

95
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,400
Caina and I spoke on the phone
for an hour.

96
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,280
I could feel that

97
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,800
she really likes me.

98
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,040
So I'm hiding from her.

99
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm playing hard to get.

100
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,040
I think it's Caina
who's hiding from you instead.

101
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,240
Are you my friend or not?

102
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Lei, what do you think?

103
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Can I not be your friend?

104
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,480
Are you kidding me?

105
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,400
And how about you?

106
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
That hurts.

107
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,520
A customized perfect carat
diamond meteor necklace?

108
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
Did Daoming Si give you this?

109
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Mom, why did you go through my things?

110
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
I didn't go through your things.

111
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
I wanted to help you unpack.

112
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,280
Don't touch this.
I'm going to give it back.

113
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,120
Give it back?

114
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,720
Did you fight with him?

115
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
No, we didn't.

116
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,440
We broke up.

117
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Broke up?

118
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,520
Weren't you two doing well
just a few days ago?

119
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
The two of us were totally incompatible.

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,280
We weren't going to last.

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Tell me.

122
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,440
Did something happen at school?

123
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,600
Nothing happened. We ended our relationship.

124
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
Nothing else happened.

125
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,320
So be it.

126
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
Did you decide to come here because of it?

127
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
I told you.

128
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,200
I came here to do some field research
for my school assignment.

129
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
All right.

130
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I've always liked that boy.

131
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,440
It's too bad.

132
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,920
I'm going to cook lunch then.

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
-Here, this way.
-Pass the ball.

134
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,680
Here.

135
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,560
-Go.
-Okay. Come on.

136
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Three-pointer.

137
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
Pass it to me.

138
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,360
Over here.

139
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,280
Si's been acting weird
since Shancai went missing.

140
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,840
He's not answering calls and messages.

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
He doesn't even talk to anyone.

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,560
Meanwhile, Lei is busy
with his graduation performance.

143
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,280
Is this going to be the end of F4?

144
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Sometimes, growing up
can be problematic too.

145
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
You know how Si is.

146
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
Nobody can tell him what to do.

147
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,560
But Shancai can.

148
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,560
The problem with you guys
is you are all too emotional.

149
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,040
Be more reasonable.

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
The problem here is that you're heartless.

151
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,640
You don't know the pain of being in love.

152
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
What are you trying to say?

153
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm just more mature.
I'm not like you childish people.

154
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,000
Sure, we're childish.

155
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,400
We're all immature.

156
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,920
Should we look for the ultimate kid, Si?

157
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,880
He shouldn't hide at home.

158
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,240
What do you think?

159
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,480
Ask him out yourself.

160
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm not the instigator.

161
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,240
It has been a while, Ximen, Meizuo.

162
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,440
Xiaozi.

163
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,200
Wait, why are you here too?

164
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,760
Why can't I be here?

165
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Don't forget.

166
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,880
F4 and I have a long history.

167
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
You see,

168
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,320
Daoming Si is my ex-fiancé.

169
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,120
Shancai is my good friend.

170
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,680
These two guys used to be my servants.

171
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,120
They bought my underwear, shopped,

172
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,160
-caught--
-All right.

173
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
That's enough. Don't bring that up again.

174
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you for real?

175
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,000
Shancai left without a word
and is still missing.

176
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,400
We're supposed to look for Daoming Si
to cheer him up a little.

177
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
How could you invite his fiancée too?

178
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
Watch your words.

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm the ex-fiancée.

180
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Shancai and Si
are two very important people in my life.

181
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
How can I not be a part of this?

182
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
Xiaozi is so loud.

183
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,640
She'll set the mood.

184
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,920
Anyway,

185
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,920
the most important agenda today
is to cheer Si up.

186
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,280
Remember, guys.

187
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,960
Don't bring up Shancai's name, ever.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,760
Si's here.

189
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,920
Daoming Si.

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
It's been a while.

191
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,600
You're still the same old guy,
always looking pissed off.

192
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
But check it out.

193
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,400
His pissed-off face

194
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,480
looks 100 times better
than his normal one.

195
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,040
You're exaggerating.

196
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,920
You're just buttering him up.

197
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
All right, I'm just kidding.

198
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
It has been a while.

199
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
You don't answer our calls
or reply to our messages.

200
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
What have you been up to?

201
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,360
There's not much you can do alone.

202
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,280
Probably reading a book,

203
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,120
listening to music and playing games.

204
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
Not necessarily.

205
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
Si has got all sorts of ideas.

206
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,760
Right?

207
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,520
I know.

208
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,080
He's been doing embroidery with Ms. Yu

209
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,920
and knitting a sweater.

210
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
That sounds like fun.

211
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,480
I know.

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,800
He was mopping the floors.

213
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,920
Daoming Si's house is huge

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
so it took him a while.

215
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,280
I don't think so.

216
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,280
Si probably snuggled up under his blanket
and looked at my photos.

217
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,760
I know, Si.

218
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,280
The more you look at my photos,
the prettier I look, right?

219
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,680
I'll be honest here.

220
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,120
It's been a while since we met.

221
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm glad to see everyone here.

222
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,560
Si, we should hang out more.
Or maybe just the two of us sometimes.

223
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,320
That's right, Si. What do you say?

224
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
You know what this is?

225
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,040
Lame.

226
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,240
What's up with the act?

227
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,920
Pretending to be all close to each other.

228
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,280
It makes me sick. What's your problem?

229
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,720
What?

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,360
You overreacted.

231
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
I overreacted?

232
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,600
You called, I came.

233
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,960
Why can't you just let me be?

234
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,960
There's no need to act all friendly.

235
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,840
You got dumped, showed up here
looking pissed, and blew your top.

236
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,760
Who's being lame?

237
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,119
Refusing to be contacted,
taking it out on your friends.

238
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,200
-What kind of a man are you?
-Shut up!

239
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,000
It's none of your business.

240
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,079
This is the reason why Shancai dumped you.

241
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,800
You guys should go.

242
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,080
The situation is out of your hands now.

243
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
Let's go.

244
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,080
That crazy bastard.

245
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,720
It's over between us.

246
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,040
Don't laugh.

247
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Listen up.

248
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm staying out of that guy's shit.

249
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Okay.

250
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,080
We'll go back for now
and deal with him tomorrow.

251
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
Not tomorrow.

252
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,240
Not ever.

253
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,880
All right.

254
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,440
But let's just go back first.

255
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,600
And from today onward,
there is no more F4.

256
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,880
This ends just like this?

257
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,360
You won't deal with him,
but you want F4 to stay intact.

258
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
What is it that you want?

259
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,880
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

260
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,280
Isn't Mr. Ye supposed
to handle the finances?

261
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,680
Why are you showing this to me?

262
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
This is our company's protocol.

263
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,640
If you're okay with the contract,
please sign it.

264
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,920
We can then proceed. Is there anything else?

265
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,240
Mr. Ye will be here later to confirm
the details of the renovation.

266
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,440
Ding Qi placed those there.

267
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,720
It doesn't concern me.

268
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,920
I was just looking.

269
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Ding Qi said you're going to go over
the renovation details with me.

270
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,760
That's why I'm still here.

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,080
I thought you didn't like renovating.

272
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,880
Because I thought
you didn't like owning a house.

273
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
I don't have one.

274
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,360
Impossible. You...

275
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,600
-Every day, you're...
-Designing houses?

276
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,400
Let me put it this way.

277
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,520
I'm an architect.

278
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,040
Not an interior designer.

279
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,720
So you helping to renovate my house is...

280
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
It's an exception because of you.

281
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,400
I know how to renovate,
but I've never done it for anyone.

282
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,680
You never did?

283
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,560
Never.

284
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,720
How should I repay you then?

285
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,760
You don't have to.

286
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,360
Just don't avoid me in the future.

287
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
I...

288
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,920
I'm not avoiding you.

289
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,760
I'm not.

290
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,120
Really?

291
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,720
I've tried to talk to you a few times,

292
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
but you avoided me. Why?

293
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,640
Because I didn't have answers
for your questions.

294
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,240
I didn't know what to say

295
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
and didn't want to think about it.

296
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,440
All right then.

297
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,080
From now on,

298
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,520
consider me your interior designer.

299
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,840
A new friend.

300
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,640
No strings attached.

301
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,960
No extra burden.

302
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,440
I won't bring up

303
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,920
what happened that night again.

304
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,000
How about that? Okay.

305
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,840
The weather is nice today.
I'll take you home.

306
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Hey, Meizuo.

307
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm having a meeting at Terence's office.

308
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
It's okay.

309
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,440
He'll take me home.

310
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
It'd better be a meeting.

311
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,560
-What?
-Meizuo.

312
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,040
You're getting too distracted by Caina.

313
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
You think I want to?

314
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,480
It's that old dude.

315
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,920
He's always sticking to her.

316
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,680
Like a Band-Aid.

317
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Who knows
whether it's an actual meeting or not.

318
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,040
Shancai.

319
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Where are you?

320
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,720
I know you won't answer calls,
but at least reply my messages.

321
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,120
Hey.

322
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Are you two my friends or not?

323
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
I'm frustrated here.
Shouldn't I get some sort of a response?

324
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,400
A guy and a girl are there together.

325
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,680
You're here being mad.

326
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,760
What can we do?

327
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
If only Si is here.

328
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,520
No, this is bad.

329
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,640
I need to throw up again.

330
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,480
It's been two months.

331
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,200
Why does Dad still get seasick?

332
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,120
It's fine. It's nothing serious.

333
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,640
He'll get used to it soon.

334
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,600
To be honest,

335
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,360
your dad isn't that outstanding,

336
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,440
but he's got a good heart.

337
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,360
He came here to help
as soon as he heard your uncle is sick.

338
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm so happy that I found such a man.

339
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,920
Not only that,

340
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
we get fresh seafood every day.

341
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,160
Mom, the food is done.

342
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,760
That quick?

343
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,120
So much beef.

344
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,640
Here, have one.

345
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
-It's pretty good. Try it.
-Okay.

346
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,840
Why is the squid so difficult though?

347
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,000
It's already dead,
but it takes so long to cook.

348
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
It's all sticking together.
Go get me some soy sauce.

349
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,160
Okay.

350
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,320
I'll be back.

351
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,600
Mom, look what I found.

352
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,200
Eight Treasure sauce?

353
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,800
Brush it on. I bet it'll taste good.

354
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,520
It smells good. Let's try it.

355
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,000
-It smells good.
-It smells good.

356
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,760
I feel better after vomiting.

357
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,160
Something smells good.

358
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,200
This is our new product,
Eight Treasure Squid.

359
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,880
Here, try one.

360
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,200
Here.

361
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,360
Dad, it's still hot.

362
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
-It's good.
-Really?

363
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
-It's delicious.
-Let me try.

364
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,800
-Here.
-I'll eat this.

365
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,960
This Eight Treasure sauce
and squid are a perfect match!

366
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,840
-It's delicious.
-Just like Romeo and Juliet.

367
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,240
Like fried tomato and egg.

368
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Me and your mom.

369
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,160
A match made in heaven.

370
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,440
I've got an idea.

371
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,200
We'll set up a stall tomorrow

372
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
to sell the Eight Treasure Squid.

373
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,600
"Sell the Eight Treasure Squid."

374
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,840
Sounds good.

375
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,760
-I think it's going to sell well.
-Me too.

376
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,760
All right.

377
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,080
Eat the squid. I'm just kidding.

378
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,320
No, we're going to do it.

379
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,360
Give me two more.

380
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,880
Meizuo, is that old dude
still not giving up?

381
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,480
You can't expect us to help you
without any plan.

382
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,480
I wouldn't be putting in so much effort

383
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,360
if they didn't meet first.

384
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,280
Women.

385
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,480
They're sentimental by nature.

386
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,240
Anticipating the future.

387
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
Reminiscing the past.

388
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,240
If that's true,
the present seems the most miserable.

389
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
That's right.

390
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,840
That's why I prefer to be
someone from the past.

391
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,680
Why do you think Caina likes you?

392
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm tall, handsome, funny,
and full of youthful energy.

393
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
I know.

394
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,840
Dating younger men is a thing nowadays.

395
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,720
It helps women maintain
a youthful outlook.

396
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,240
I remember.

397
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,400
When I'm with Caina,

398
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,320
she'd say,

399
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
"How nice it is to be young."

400
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,440
She also said,

401
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,040
"I wish I could be young again."

402
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,200
If that's the case,

403
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,160
let us go back
to when Caina is still young.

404
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,960
Us?

405
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,920
Yes.

406
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,520
Us, F4.

407
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,640
Si...

408
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
Don't you want to make up with Si?

409
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,760
DONG'S KING OF SQUID
SIGNATURE FLAVOR: EIGHT TREASURE SQUID

410
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,480
-Shancai, hurry up.
-Okay.

411
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
-I heard the squid is awesome.
-It's good.

412
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,240
-I've been coming often.
-It's really good.

413
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,160
Done.

414
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,600
-It smells delicious.
-It's good.

415
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,840
Hello. How many skewers?

416
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,760
-Three.
-Here. Three skewers?

417
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,680
Thanks for waiting.

418
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
I want it extra spicy.

419
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,480
I love them spicy.

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,920
-Here you go.
-Almost done.

421
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
Here, please enjoy.

422
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

423
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
-Hi. Your three skewers.
-Thanks.

424
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,840
Mom, how are you holding up?
Are you tired?

425
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
Not at all. There's no time to be tired.

426
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,120
Your dad needs to work harder
to catch more squid at sea.

427
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,520
-Three skewers?
-Yes.

428
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,560
-Okay.
-Thanks for waiting.

429
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
No worries.

430
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Mrs. Dong.

431
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Your business is doing well.

432
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,320
Oh, ma'am.

433
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,960
I've been so busy with the stall
that I forgot to pay the rent.

434
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll give it to you right away.

435
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,920
Here, have some squid.

436
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,280
I didn't come here today to collect rent.

437
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,760
I wanted to ask

438
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,240
if you'd like me
to be your business partner.

439
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,120
I'll help you sell the squid.

440
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,920
Well, I'd be happy to let you.

441
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,280
But it's just a small village.

442
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,600
If people buy from your shop,
who's going to come here?

443
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,520
I can lower the rent.

444
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,680
And pay you commission.

445
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,840
What do you say?

446
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,440
That sounds pretty good.

447
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,640
But the Eight Treasure sauce
that Shancai created

448
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
is a family secret.

449
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,560
We don't plan to sell it.

450
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Sorry about that.

451
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,840
Wait, ma'am.

452
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,840
Hold on.

453
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,720
I just thought of an idea.

454
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
I can create a few more flavors.

455
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,240
This way, we won't
get in each other's way.

456
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,960
Will that work?

457
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
That's awesome.

458
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,480
Very good.

459
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,880
How is it? It's good.

460
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,240
I haven't seen you in a while.

461
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,800
I've been busy
with my graduation performance.

462
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,040
And also,

463
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
Si hasn't hung out with us much.

464
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,480
Yes.

465
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,440
Since Shancai left,

466
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,960
Si's been keeping to himself.

467
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm worried about him. I hope you guys

468
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,600
will ask him out more often

469
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,120
and get him out of his shell.

470
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm not hungry!

471
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,360
It's you.

472
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,120
I don't have any appetite.

473
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,520
Are you still angry?

474
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm not.

475
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
But you seem so sad.

476
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,480
Isn't that obvious?

477
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,040
Why are you still asking?

478
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
It's been going on for too long.
I'm used to seeing you happy and unhappy.

479
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,480
But right now, we need you with us.

480
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,640
I should say that
Meizuo needs us with him.

481
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,600
We agreed, right?

482
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,920
Keeping company is a sign of friendship.

483
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,480
Sometimes, we need to do
things we don't like

484
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,360
for the sake of someone important.

485
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Like right now.

486
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
To make Ms. Yu happy,

487
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,920
you should drink this glass of soy milk.

488
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,960
Lame.

489
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,960
What's up with you guys?

490
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
Good morning, miss.

491
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,440
Change into these

492
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,360
and come on a picnic with us.

493
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Daoming Si.

494
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,640
Are you in a bad mood?

495
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Why don't you join them?

496
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
I know we're not that close. But I still remember you well.

497
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
During the cooking competition,

498
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,000
you cheered for Shancai
through the window.

499
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,240
And she won the special prize.

500
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,000
It was because of your support.

501
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,160
Are you two doing well?

502
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,160
We broke up.

503
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,640
Normally, girls need some time.

504
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,600
Give her some space.

505
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,800
And you?

506
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
Do you like Meizuo?

507
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,920
I need some time to think about it too.

508
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
She said,

509
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,120
"It's so good

510
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,680
to have you.

511
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,480
So good."

512
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,440
Right? Didn't she?

513
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
She said I'm worth seven stars.

514
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,480
"So, so good."

515
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,360
You've said that 20 times.

516
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,520
It's actually 21 times. Is that even a sentence?

517
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,040
Not a sentence.

518
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,080
Just a word.

519
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,480
Hey.

520
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,240
Can't you guys share
this happy moment with me?

521
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,920
I know Shancai is missing.

522
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
Si's heartbroken.

523
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,520
But I'm still here.

524
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Shancai's missing.

525
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,800
Si's heartbroken.

526
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,080
Meizuo's drunk in love.

527
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,440
Lei.

528
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,080
You're the only one who's normal now.

529
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
I couldn't care less.

530
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,520
Can you guys show more concern?

531
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,280
Are you even my friends?

532
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,760
Meizuo.

533
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,320
Hello.

534
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,560
Good.

535
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,000
So good.

536
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,000
-So funny.
-Huaze Lei.

537
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,480
Okay, Meizuo.

538
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,120
You're our pride.

539
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
You want to talk about Caina?
We'll do that.

540
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Then again,

541
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,120
Ye Mingchuan was going after
Caina aggressively,

542
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,040
but he suddenly stopped doing that.

543
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,520
I guess he wasn't that serious
about Caina.

544
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,120
He is serious.

545
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,560
Or else you wouldn't be so worried.

546
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,560
Even if he's serious, so what?

547
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,920
He might be serious about her,
but so am I.

548
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,120
The point is, I love her.

549
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,480
Good.

550
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,280
Make your move while you still can.

551
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,720
Just don't regret it in the future.

552
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,680
Hello, Caina.

553
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,000
What are you doing?

554
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,120
I'm with the guys.

555
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,680
Hello, Ms. Caina.

556
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Caina, Li Quan is having
a concert this weekend.

557
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,120
Do you want to go?

558
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,400
Okay.

559
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,400
I'll see you there then.

560
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,720
See you there.

561
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,280
A concert this weekend?

562
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,760
I want to go too.

563
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,120
I'm afraid not this time.

564
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,680
I need to prepare for our perfect date.

565
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,440
It was hard to get tickets
for the best seats.

566
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,360
I won't let them go to waste.

567
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,400
Have you finished your report?

568
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm a top student.

569
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,840
I won't let my social life
get in the way of my studies.

570
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,440
Right now,

571
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,480
I'm the world's luckiest guy.
