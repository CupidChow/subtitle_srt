A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 29

3
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,320
Look.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,440
To preserve the history of the house,

5
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I suggest not breaking
its entire structure.

6
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,280
Let's keep some old structures
and add new elements.

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,680
What do you think?

8
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm not an expert in this field.

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
You two can decide.

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,800
Then let's do it soon.

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,800
After Mr. Ye goes out of the country,

12
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,760
it might be a few years
before he comes back again.

13
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,560
You're going overseas?

14
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Where? Well...

15
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Talk to Mr. Ye.

16
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Don't worry.

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,400
I'll complete the design for your house.

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,320
I'll take care of it until it's finished.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,120
How long will you be away?

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
Aren't you coming back anymore?

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
Why?

22
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,040
I accepted the offer

23
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,880
from Mr. Brown, a Cambridge seismologist.

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm joining his team
to go all over the world

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,400
to help construct earthquake-proof
houses for earthquake victims.

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
When are you leaving?

27
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
Soon.

28
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
All right.

29
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,280
Are you mad?

30
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,400
What right do I have to be mad?

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,320
With such a great plan,

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
you should forge ahead without hesitation.

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,880
You don't have a house and family.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,840
There's nothing to keep you here.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,640
You can go wherever you want.

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,000
But I'm not like you.

37
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
This is my work.

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,120
It's also my dream.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,280
This is what I do.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Then we have nothing to talk about, right?

41
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,200
We shouldn't have started
in the first place.

42
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,920
Don't you have any feelings for me?

43
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,520
No.

44
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,320
Then why did you keep
that coconut in your house?

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,560
You saw it?

46
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Yes.

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
After I saw you again,

48
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't want to travel alone anymore.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,320
I want to see the world with you.

50
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
And live in different tents.

51
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,480
Sing,

52
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,880
dance,

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
drink and chat.

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,640
That's the life I dream of.

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Why me?

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Fate.

57
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Fate?

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,440
You want me to believe in fate?

59
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,560
I believe in it.

60
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
I believe that fate let us
meet each other.

61
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,640
I've never been happier than that day.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
But that won't last forever.

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,880
You can decide if will or won't.

64
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,440
Are you willing to come with me, Caina?

65
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
I...

66
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
You don't have to answer me now.

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Because your answer
is very important to me.

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,040
Tell me after thinking about it.

69
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,720
Mr. Lu, what's the matter?

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,480
The robot vacuum got stuck on something
while it was cleaning.

71
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm trying to get it out.

72
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,560
It's a coconut.

73
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,480
I wonder when it fell on the floor.

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,880
Why did I bring you home with me?

75
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
I believe in it.

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,760
I believe that fate let us
meet each other.

77
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,960
I've never been happier than that day.

78
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
But that won't last forever.

79
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,400
You can decide if will or won't.

80
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
My dear Caina.

81
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,480
I miss you.

82
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
What are you doing now?

83
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,200
Meizuo.

84
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,840
Let's meet at the bar in an hour.

85
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,760
I have something important to tell you.

86
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
What should I do?

87
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,640
What should I do?

88
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,520
Why am I leaving?

89
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
Caina?

90
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
It's late. Why are you here?

91
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,000
Were you looking for me?

92
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,680
You said I can decide on everything.

93
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
You'll do whatever I want.

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
But I think the answer lies with you.

95
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,600
This is the answer I'm giving you.

96
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,800
What happened, Caina?

97
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
I should be the one asking that!

98
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
You like to travel
and see different women.

99
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't get me involved!

100
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,600
-Why do you say that?
-I saw it.

101
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,200
-Ding Qi? Listen to me, Caina.
-You don't need to explain.

102
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,480
I don't want to hear it.

103
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
-Listen.
-It's none of my business!

104
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
I came to tell you

105
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
that I hope you'll leave.

106
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,040
Regardless if it's three or five years,

107
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,680
I never want to see you again
in this lifetime.

108
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
What do you think?

109
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
The green color is quite interesting.

110
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,920
I know, right? That's my latest cocktail.

111
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
Try it and see if you like it.

112
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
You're here.

113
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,440
I know I asked you to come here.

114
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Why did you arrive
ten minutes earlier than me?

115
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Miss Caina.

116
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,320
Because I want to let girls
who admire me know

117
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
that I'm waiting for her.

118
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,840
Meizuo.

119
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,920
You're a really good man.

120
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,840
But don't girls like bad men?

121
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,000
I left that bad man in the end.

122
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,160
Is something bothering you?

123
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
No.

124
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,840
Nothing is bothering me.

125
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,840
I have such a cute
and thoughtful little boyfriend.

126
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
Others would be so envious of me.

127
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,800
Waiter, I want to drink.

128
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,920
Give me a double red dynamite.

129
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,080
All right.

130
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
You're drinking so much.

131
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,960
Are you trying to get drunk?

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
I can hold my liquor now.

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
Your red dynamite.

134
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
Don't just...

135
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,040
Caina, are you all right?

136
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
I just feel

137
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,920
that I'm so lucky not to fall in love
with a bad man.

138
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,760
Let's drink.

139
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't drink anymore.

140
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Be careful.

141
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Ms. Zhou, why are you so drunk?

142
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,800
-Take her upstairs.
-All right. Hi, Mr. Lu.

143
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,160
Go on.

144
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,000
-You...
-I'm home.

145
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
Lie down and rest for a while.

146
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
But I still want to drink.

147
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,560
-I'm not drunk.
-Yes, you are.

148
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Give me more.

149
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,280
Lie down and rest for a while.

150
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,560
-Okay?
-Give me more.

151
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,760
-Mr. Lu.
-Here.

152
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Yes. You can drink more.
Have some warm water first.

153
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
-Is it alcohol?
-Yes, it is.

154
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,040
Liar!

155
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,560
What is that?

156
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
It's so annoying.

157
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't want to see it. Mr. Lu.

158
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,000
Throw it away!

159
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,480
Throw this lousy coconut away!

160
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,840
But Ms. Zhou this is your...

161
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,360
Throw it away!

162
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,720
-Get it out of my sight!
-Okay.

163
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,440
I'll throw it away.

164
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,920
I will.

165
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
Are you all right?

166
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,360
Come on.

167
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
The coconut.

168
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,040
Take it away.

169
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
Why?

170
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,360
The coconut.

171
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,080
I don't want to see it.

172
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,920
Why?

173
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,200
The coconut has a smile
carved by Ye Mingchuan.

174
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,200
I don't want to see
that annoying guy anymore.

175
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,079
Don't just...

176
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
You're awake? Meizuo?

177
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,680
Good morning.

178
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,480
Here you go, Ms. Zhou.

179
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,920
-Drink orange juice for your hangover.
-Okay.

180
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,080
Meizuo.

181
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,600
Didn't you go home last night?

182
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
Ms. Zhou, have you forgotten?

183
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,000
You were so drunk last night.

184
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,520
Meizuo brought you home.

185
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,360
And he took care of you all night.

186
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
Sorry, Meizuo.

187
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,200
I must have been a sight yesterday, right?

188
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,000
It's fine.

189
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,840
I've seen worse.

190
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,680
Ms. Zhou.

191
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,240
You vomited and made a fuss
the whole night.

192
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,560
And you kept on talking.

193
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,240
You insisted on throwing
that coconut away.

194
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,120
And you insisted you were not drunk
and you wanted to drink more.

195
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,480
What? Say it again.

196
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
And you insisted you were not drunk
and you wanted to drink more.

197
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,160
-Before that.
-Before...

198
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,280
You asked me to throw that coconut away.

199
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,040
Where did you throw it? In the trash can outside.

200
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,200
I don't want to see it.

201
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,840
Why?

202
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,520
The coconut has a smile
carved by Ye Mingchuan.

203
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,960
I don't want to see
that annoying guy anymore.

204
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,160
-It smells so good.
-Yes.

205
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,120
-It's delicious.
-I'm so hungry.

206
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
Hello to the viewers of Tengxun broadcast.

207
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
We're broadcasting now.

208
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,160
I'm Ms. Fang, your foodie host.

209
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Welcome to one of the food streets
in the fishing village.

210
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
The trending Dong's King of Squid
in Weibo created a squid fever here

211
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,960
and attracted many tourists,
making this place a hot spot.

212
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,000
Look. This girl wearing a cute hat

213
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,840
is the creator of Dong's King of Squid.

214
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Mom, these are ready. Here.

215
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,320
Be careful. It's hot.

216
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
-Hi, how many do you want?
-Two.

217
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,320
Okay, two.

218
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,400
Here.

219
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,320
-Hi, how many do you want?
-Two.

220
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
Two. I have two here.

221
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,960
Here you go.

222
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,360
Come on. Cheers.

223
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,240
Sorry to keep you waiting.

224
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
Mom, it's for that table over there.

225
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,640
Be careful. It's hot. Here. These are yours.

226
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,280
Enjoy.

227
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,800
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

228
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
Mom, these are ready.

229
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,520
Hi, how many do you want?

230
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,320
-Two.
-Okay. Two.

231
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
DAOMING SI

232
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,600
Hello? Daoming Si.

233
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,360
Are you free right now?

234
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,440
Hey.

235
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,120
Are you listening to me?

236
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
Shancai's in the fishing village nearby.

237
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
You found her?

238
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,440
I thought she was kidnapped
for hard labor.

239
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,360
She was.

240
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
She looks tired.

241
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,400
Do you know what she's doing?

242
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,320
She's grilling squid.

243
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,400
She's all sweaty.

244
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,320
She can't speak properly
from all the smoke.

245
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,160
And she's creating a new flavor.

246
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,040
She's really great.

247
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,520
She's so creative.

248
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,600
Why are you still sitting there?
Go pick her up.

249
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,680
I'm not going.

250
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,840
You go.

251
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,640
But what does it have to do with me?

252
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,280
If it's none of your business,
it's even more so with me.

253
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,760
You're her friend. You can go.

254
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Let's go together.

255
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,720
Don't be silly.

256
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,120
She left me.

257
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,600
Why should I go?

258
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,680
Go if you want to.

259
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,280
You don't need my permission.

260
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,120
That song earlier was really good.

261
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,600
Right?

262
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
My makeup is all messed up.

263
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,760
My eyes are swollen.

264
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,360
I think you're especially cute today.

265
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,120
Are you teasing me?

266
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm serious.

267
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,560
Meizuo.

268
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Why are you so nice to me?

269
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,240
Because you're worth it.

270
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,160
Next time, I'll bring you
to a jazz concert.

271
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,880
What's your favorite song?

272
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,280
I like Casablanca.

273
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,160
Have you seen that movie?

274
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,160
It's a story about Rick
sending his lover and rival away.

275
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,040
-Who are you looking for?
-I'm Zhou Caina's boyfriend.

276
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,760
I'm here to see Mr. Ye Mingchuan.

277
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,560
If you don't let him see me,

278
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,480
I'll stand here
until he gets off from work.

279
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,800
-You--
-It's simple and straightforward.

280
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,840
I'm here to end our rivalry
once and for all.

281
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,280
Please tell him that.

282
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,360
You're not here to discuss
architectural design with me, are you?

283
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,480
Ye Mingchuan.

284
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,520
What exactly did you do to Caina?

285
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,120
What do you mean?

286
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,520
Caina seems so unhappy.

287
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,360
I know it's because of you.

288
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,280
You should ask her.

289
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,320
Why are you asking me?

290
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,440
Because I care about her.

291
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
I don't want her to be sad.

292
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,920
Is that so?

293
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,720
What are your feelings towards Caina?

294
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,680
You shouldn't be the one asking me.

295
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,760
Do you want to go on like this?

296
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,880
Flirt with girls, dump them,
not take any responsibility,

297
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,920
and continue making them miserable?

298
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,680
What have you done for her?

299
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,840
I worked hard to make her happy.

300
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,600
I make her laugh every day.

301
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,360
I give her little gifts every day
to show her how I feel.

302
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,240
How about you?

303
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
Yes.

304
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,840
Every time I see her,

305
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,640
I can see the uneasiness in her eyes.

306
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
I want to tell you something.

307
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm in a hurry. Maybe next time.
Meizuo's waiting for me.

308
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,720
You don't have to.

309
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,240
Just don't avoid me in the future.

310
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,280
I...

311
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,520
I'm not avoiding you.

312
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
I thought I could do it.

313
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,000
But no matter how hard I try,
I can't make her happy.

314
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
I can only make her sad.

315
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,440
-Ding Qi? Listen to me, Caina.
-You don't need to explain.

316
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,840
I don't want to hear it.

317
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
-Listen.
-It's none of my business!

318
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,040
I came to tell you

319
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,120
that I hope you'll leave.

320
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,920
Regardless if it's three or five years,

321
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,560
I never want to see you again
in this lifetime.

322
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,320
Even now,

323
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,920
she thinks I'm seeing different women.

324
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,240
She's so disappointed in me.

325
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,200
James is seeing another woman.

326
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,080
What should I do?

327
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,680
What should I do?

328
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,880
It'll be all right.

329
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,480
Fine.

330
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,760
Just treat me as a womanizing scumbag.

331
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,440
Then she'd get over me quickly
and be happy again.

332
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,360
What do you mean?

333
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,440
I won't bother her again.

334
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,880
I've accepted an offer overseas.

335
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,480
I've made the preparations.

336
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
I'll be leaving in a few days.

337
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
But before I go,

338
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,200
I hope you can give something to her.

339
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,360
Please give this to her on my behalf.

340
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,680
I hope you can always make her happy.

341
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,960
DONG'S KING OF SQUID

342
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
-It's taking so long.
-I'm craving this.

343
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,560
-How much longer?
-Here.

344
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
We've lined up for two hours.

345
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm so hungry.

346
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,760
How many are we getting?

347
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,760
-My legs are killing me.
-It's numb.

348
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,920
-Is two enough?
-Almost done.

349
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,480
There are so many people.
Never mind. Let's go.

350
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
It smells so good.

351
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,800
We're almost there.

352
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,560
Why is your hat so ugly?

353
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Why are you here?

354
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm here to bring you home.

355
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,440
Huaze Lei. Make sure to eat a lot.

356
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,040
Don't be shy.

357
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,120
Thank you.

358
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Here.

359
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,000
Is this the legendary
Eight Treasure Squid?

360
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
-It's really good.
-All right.

361
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,400
Do you want some Yakult with it?
It will taste even better.

362
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,360
Here. By the way, Shancai.

363
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,200
You've stayed here for so long.

364
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,680
When are you going back to school?

365
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
I don't want to go back yet.

366
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,440
Is your seafood survey assignment
that difficult?

367
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,600
You're not done yet?

368
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,240
No, I'm not.

369
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
Shancai.

370
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,400
I remember your professor said
that you can go back

371
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,800
if you're almost done with it.

372
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,720
Yes. Why are you staying here?

373
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,880
You can ask your professors
if you have any questions.

374
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Right? Here.

375
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,360
Here. Huaze Lei.

376
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,560
-Try this flavor.
-Shancai has never cut any class before.

377
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,160
She does well in school.

378
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,560
We don't need to worry about her.

379
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,720
-Of course. Whose daughter is she?
-Yes.

380
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,360
I also believe Shancai
would not disappoint you.

381
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,680
Right, Shancai?

382
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,640
I'll go back to school
as soon as possible.

383
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,320
Have some more.

384
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,600
They don't have this in school.

385
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,120
Your Yakult.

386
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
It's quite nice here.

387
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
How did you know I'm here?

388
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,000
I saw the trending video online.

389
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,080
Your outfit was really nice.

390
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,280
You were grilling squid.

391
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,520
You looked really cool cooking it.

392
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,880
You're the special prize winner
of the culinary competition indeed.

393
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,719
You didn't disappoint.

394
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,080
You can survive anywhere.

395
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,320
Thanks for coming here.

396
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,679
Don't thank me.

397
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,960
How is he doing?

398
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,800
You can see him
when you go back to school.

399
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,760
If you like him that much,
why won't you tell him?

400
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,080
It's because I like him,

401
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,719
that's why I can't let him know.

402
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,360
-Hi, how many do you want?
-Three.

403
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Three. All right.

404
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,160
Do you want extra or less chili?

405
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,440
-Extra.
-All right.

406
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,480
-Yes.
-Here.

407
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,440
How many do you want?

408
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,840
-Two.
-Two. All right.

409
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,240
-Do you want extra chili?
-No. Put less.

410
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,440
All right. Is two enough?

411
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
-Dine-in.
-Almost done.

412
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,680
Please wait a moment.

413
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,960
There are so many people. Let's go.

414
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,760
Three sticks with extra chili.

415
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,080
-Okay, thanks.
-Be careful.

416
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,800
-Thank you.
-Look at that girl.

417
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,200
-She's quite efficient.
-Yes.

418
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
Hi, how many do you want?

419
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,360
-Five.
-Give me five.

420
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,480
All right.

421
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,400
-It's good.
-I'm craving this.

422
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,400
It's delicious.

423
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,920
-Yes.
-Two sticks. Be careful.

424
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
-We've lined up for two hours.
-Thanks.

425
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,360
-It's numb.
-It's numb.

426
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,520
Hi, how many do you want?

427
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,080
-I want five.
-Five.

428
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,440
There are so many people.

429
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,960
-Do you want extra or less chili?
-Less.

430
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,120
All right.

431
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,680
-It smells so good.
-Two for me.

432
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,360
-Sure. Two, right?
-Yes.

433
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,680
Do you want extra or less chili?

434
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
Extra.

435
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,880
-Sure. Please wait.
-I'm so hungry.

436
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
What are you looking for?

437
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,000
A place to rent in Airbnb.

438
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,120
There's no need.

439
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,960
We already took care of it.

440
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,440
What?

441
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,080
Shancai, we're here.

442
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,320
Ta-da! Look.

443
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,800
It's so nice.

444
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Is this really where I lived?

445
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,720
Let me tell you.

446
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,160
This sofa. I bought it.

447
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,360
Xiaoyou bought this chair.

448
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,800
And this knife.

449
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
Li Zhen brought it from home.

450
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,840
-Nice, right?
-It's not just nice.

451
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,080
It's a dreamland.

452
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,040
This table is so pretty too.

453
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,600
-Is it from the online second-hand store?
-Yes.

454
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,840
I was afraid you'll be mad
if it's too expensive.

455
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,640
The quality might be bad
if it's too cheap.

456
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,040
So I chose carefully
from the online second-hand store.

457
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,800
This is brand new.

458
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,200
I bought it when I saw
that it's 40 percent off.

459
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
They'll deliver more furniture later.

460
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,840
Thank you, Qinghe. I really like it.

461
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,080
Why do you need to thank me?

462
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,760
I also picked that pillow for you.

463
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,880
Hugging it is like hugging me.

464
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
Let's all welcome Shancai back.

465
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,760
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

466
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,800
By the way, Shancai,

467
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,000
Meizuo wants me
to welcome you back on his behalf.

468
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,480
He'll come when he's free.

469
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,800
You know he's pursuing Caina right now.

470
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,040
And kept asking us to listen
to their love story.

471
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Really?

472
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,840
I want to know too.

473
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,400
How did they get together?

474
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,600
Someone's willing to listen to it.

475
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,760
Great! We're finally off the hook.

476
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,360
Xiaozi, you can ask Meizuo anytime.

477
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,520
You have to listen to him yourself.

478
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,800
I think you guys are trying to trick me.

479
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,360
How come? Why would we do that to you?

480
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,760
-Hey, Shancai. I want to try your squid.
-Me too.

481
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,400
-Shancai, we all want to try it.
-No.

482
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,560
There are so many of you.

483
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,880
If I grill them now,

484
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,040
then won't all of you suffocate
from the smoke?

485
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
I'll get it.

486
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,720
What...

487
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,040
What's this?

488
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,720
Hi, I'm ZZ Bear.

489
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,840
We're delivering the furniture you bought
from the online second-hand store.

490
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,320
You deliver so fast!

491
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Thank you for choosing
our online second-hand store.

492
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,400
Our items are varied and practical.

493
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,400
We hope you'll continue supporting us.

494
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,320
By the way, this is for you.

495
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
It's so cute! Thank you.

496
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
I just ordered it yesterday.
It's here today.

497
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,720
ZZ Bear, you're so great!

498
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I want to give you a big hug!

499
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,080
Dong Shancai, you're so lucky.

500
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,240
There are so many good friends
who care about you.

501
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,520
Come on.

502
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,680
Even though...

503
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,280
-I want to take a picture too.
-I'll do it.

504
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,400
Move over a bit.

505
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
I can't be that greedy.

506
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,840
I already have so much.

507
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,640
FRIEND ACTIVITY

508
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
DONG SHANCAI

509
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,880
Thank you, Huaze Lei,
for bringing me back to Shanghai

510
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,840
and renting my old place.

511
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,560
Thanks to all my good friends
who prepared such a nice surprise.

512
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,600
Thank you, everyone. I'm back!

513
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,080
Am I a fool?

514
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,240
I know perfectly well that Ye Mingchuan
is just playing around.

515
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,160
That night in Yunan,

516
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
he said he won't settle down.

517
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,640
Now,

518
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,600
I saw him flirting with his assistant.

519
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,120
I should have realized

520
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,400
that he's not serious with me.

521
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,800
Why am I still keeping this lousy coconut?

522
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,320
I must be crazy.

523
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,480
What should I do?

524
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,800
Is there a cocktail called,

525
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,240
"I'll surely regret what I'll do today"?

526
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,400
Yes.

527
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,760
Then I want one.

528
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,400
And add a little "sacrifice" in it.

529
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,400
All right.

530
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,960
No matter what,

531
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,840
meeting me is the start of your happiness.

532
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,800
To your future.

533
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Cheers.

534
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,520
I like it.

535
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,000
Meeting you is the start of my happiness.

536
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
Let's toast to our future.

537
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,400
Your "sacrifice."

538
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
I'll surely regret

539
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,680
what I'll do today.
