A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 15

3
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,560
Hey, can you be more punctual?

4
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,080
You're always late for our dates.
Is your watch using local US time?

5
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,400
I was late by just ten minutes.

6
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,000
-Don't be so irritated.
-I'm irritated?

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,440
You're the one who's late,
but you're complaining about me?

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,120
It's not nice to shout at a girl.

9
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,200
You're such an embarrassment to us men.

10
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,440
Where did this brat come from?

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,080
I'm not a brat. My name is Xiao Long.

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,880
He's the kid my neighbor
asked me to care of.

13
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,400
He's alone so I brought him here
or else he'd feel so sad.

14
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,880
Him? He looks like a gangster.
How can he be sad?

15
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,080
-It hurts.
-How can you be sad?

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
It hurts. Let go.

17
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,800
-Hey.
-You're a bad guy.

18
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
Don't bully a kid, okay?

19
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,200
Shancai, you're the best.

20
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
Can we go play?

21
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,200
Hey, you're putting on an act
and pretending to be cute.

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,800
Shancai, don't be fooled by him.

23
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
Why are you fighting with a kid?

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
Xiao Long. Where would you like to go?

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
I don't know.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,880
I remember you told me
that you haven't been to the zoo.

27
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,440
-Do you want to go there?
-Sure.

28
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Zoo? We just got here
and now you're going to the zoo.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,240
-Do you know how far that is?
-No.

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Let's go.

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,320
Are you having fun?

32
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,800
Is that a monkey?

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,640
Let's go and see the monkeys. She's even more childish than the kid.

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,480
Have you seen that before?

35
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,080
I've never seen a real monkey before.

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes, it's been awhile
since I saw a real monkey.

37
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,320
What's that monkey doing?

38
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,320
Guess what?

39
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,120
That monkey looks so ugly.

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,440
As ugly as you.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Who are you calling ugly, stupid boy?

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,440
Go slowly.

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm way more handsome than you guys.

44
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
Shancai, is this a goat?

45
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes.

46
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
Goat's milk is similar to cow's milk.
You can drink it.

47
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,240
And it's even more nutritious.

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,600
Really?

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
Then I want to have him as a pet.

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,280
That way, I can ride him
and go to you so we can play.

51
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,680
No. That's too dangerous.

52
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,200
Then can I feed him?

53
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,560
Can we go down now?

54
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
Do you see the tiger?

55
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,200
I don't see it.

56
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
You don't? He's over there.

57
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,280
No. I don't see it.

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
-You still can't see it?
-No.

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Come on. Can you see it, little midget?

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
I see it.

61
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,760
Shancai, the tiger is so beautiful.

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Xiao Long, do you know

63
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,520
that feline animals would produce
a sound when they're happy?

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
Really? I didn't know that.

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
Of course not.

66
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Because you're a canine.

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,760
He really is a kid.
He can fall asleep just like that.

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
Yes.

69
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,640
Let me hold that for him.

70
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
There's no need for that.

71
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,200
-Daoming Si.
-What?

72
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,400
-Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

73
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,120
You said that out of the blue.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,080
How could I understand that?

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,560
Why did you lend me money?

76
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
Why did you support me to join
the competition?

77
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,840
-Why are you spending the day with me?
-Because you're stupid.

78
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,960
What did I do to infuriate you again?

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't you know the answer to that?

80
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,240
Can't you use your brain
to think about it?

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,200
I...

82
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
If I can figure it out,
why would I ask you?

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,160
You're a bipolar, manic-depressive guy who
can't talk normally and likes to shout!

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,440
-I don't want to talk to you!
-Then don't!

85
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,760
It's really tiring to talk
with someone dumb like you.

86
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
-Why did this brat pee on me?
-Hey!

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,560
-You'll wake him up!
-So what?

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,760
-Why are you so annoying?
-Who's annoying?

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,560
-You!
-I'm annoying, right?

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,840
-I'll show you what's even more annoying.
-Hey! You'll hurt him.

91
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,080
Since I'm so annoying,
don't ever see me again.

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,400
Fine! I won't see you again!

93
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,200
Xiao Long, it's okay.

94
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
Don't cry anymore, okay?

95
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
I peed in my pants.

96
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,920
It's so embarrassing!

97
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Xiao Long. Look.
Do you want some strawberry cake?

98
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,320
I want to eat the strawberries.

99
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,800
Okay, sure.

100
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Shancai, this one's for you.

101
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,840
That's nice. You know how to share.

102
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,160
Shancai.

103
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,640
Is there any problem?

104
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,840
I must have messed up that guy's clothes.

105
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
You mean Daoming Si?

106
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Forget about him.

107
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,200
Let me give you some advice.

108
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,240
Don't be like him when you grow up.

109
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,000
But when he lifted me on his shoulders,

110
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,280
it felt like he was my dad.

111
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Anyway,

112
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,960
I think he's quite nice.

113
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
I know.

114
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,000
That guy is nice at times.

115
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
But I always want to fight with him
when I see him.

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Shancai, I want to come
and play with you again.

117
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,920
You're welcome here anytime.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,040
Remember you have to keep
that thing a secret.

119
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
What thing?

120
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,560
You mean peeing in your pants?

121
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,160
Xiao Long.

122
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,560
You peed in your pants again?

123
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
How old are you?

124
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,920
I told you to keep it a secret.
I'm so mad.

125
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
All right. I'm not going to tell
anybody else.

126
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,640
Tell that guy,

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,240
after I get more practice on that game,
I'll seek him out for revenge.

128
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,880
All right. Let's go home then.

129
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,080
Say goodbye to Shancai.

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
-Shancai, bye.
-Bye.

131
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
Thank you.

132
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
Bye.

133
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Why did you lend me money?

134
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,880
Why did you support me to join
the competition?

135
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,920
-Why are you spending the day with me?
-Because you're stupid.

136
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,280
What did I do to infuriate you again?

137
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't you know the answer to that?

138
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,040
Can't you use your brain
to think about it?

139
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,320
This is our restaurant's signature dish,
Lobster Thermidor.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,840
I made that sauce using my own recipe.

141
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,280
It contains a lot of ingredients.

142
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,560
And it needs to be cooked for three hours
in order to create this flavorful dish.

143
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,800
If the timing is not precise,
the flavor would be wrong.

144
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,640
As for this steak, it's also
one of our restaurant's specialties.

145
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,160
The sauce is very unique.

146
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello?

147
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,240
Dad.

148
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,240
I've thought about it already.

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
Tian Ye is not the man I want.

150
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
What's the matter?
You don't like him anymore?

151
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
No, it's not that.

152
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
Then what happened?

153
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,480
He wants to live a certain way.

154
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,000
But I don't want

155
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,040
that kind of life.

156
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Thank you. Wait.

157
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
How do I know this is yours?

158
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,960
Isn't it obvious?

159
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,080
I think it's better to give
a lost item to the police.

160
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
You're quite interesting. What do you want?

161
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,320
Buy me a drink.

162
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,440
Turns out the famous F4 is so cheap.

163
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,360
Turns out the cooking competition
champion is so stingy.

164
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,960
That Hong Kong style fried crab you made
with garlic was really interesting.

165
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,120
I know, right? When I was overseas,
I cooked it every day

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,080
because I missed the taste of home.

167
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,680
Honestly, you really cooked that dish
so well that day.

168
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Stop it.

169
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,720
I know you guys were there
to cheer for Shancai.

170
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,160
I'm an exception.

171
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,040
When you won, I clapped so hard.

172
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,720
It's a pity you didn't hear it.

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Is that so?

174
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,800
Then why were you cheering for me?

175
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,800
You're all Shancai's friends, right?

176
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,720
That's true,

177
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,160
but after the cooking competition started,

178
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,200
I also wanted you to be my friend.

179
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,640
Are you interested in me?

180
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,320
You think too much.

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
We're not that close.

182
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,040
I just want to be your friend.

183
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,040
Aren't you buying me a drink?

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Sure.

185
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
What do you want? Order it. It's my treat.

186
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,440
Wei Xun.

187
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,240
What can I do for you?

188
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,920
The bartender here is my friend.

189
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,360
He has a special talent.

190
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,320
He can make any drink you want.

191
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,600
Is that so?

192
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,080
Then I have to test him.

193
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,280
I want to order a drink
that would prevent me

194
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,680
from ever meeting someone who asks
for favors after finding up a lost item.

195
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,560
Well...

196
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,560
I guess you two didn't expect that.

197
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
We have that, of course.

198
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,480
A drink that would not ask favors
after picking up a lost item, right?

199
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Then I want one too.

200
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,080
A drink that would let me meet
a cute but arrogant girl again.

201
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,920
Do you have that too?

202
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
Well...

203
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,200
We have that, of course.

204
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,360
A drink that would let you meet
a cute but arrogant girl again.

205
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,840
Just those two, right?

206
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Yes, thank you.

207
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Here you go.

208
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,240
This drink is so sour.

209
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
I think he wants that person
who picked up a lost item

210
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,360
and asked for favors to suffer.

211
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,040
All right.

212
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,360
Now it's your turn.

213
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,560
You're wasting time.

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,800
Are you scared of drinking it?

215
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Of course not.

216
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm afraid that I'll meet

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,440
a cute but arrogant girl
daily after I drink it.

218
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
What should I do?

219
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
I get it.

220
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,200
You don't want to drink it.

221
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
I'm not afraid of drinking it.

222
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,080
I'm afraid that
you'll fall in love with me.

223
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,800
It's bitter.

224
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,960
It tells you that falling in love with
a cute but arrogant girl is going to be

225
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,240
a very bitter experience.

226
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,880
Meizuo, who did you go
on a date with yesterday?

227
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,720
You weren't answering your phone.

228
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
It's a secret.

229
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,599
Why are you being so mysterious?

230
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
Didn't you mention the other day
that you're going out with an older woman?

231
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
Where did you guys go during the holiday?

232
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,080
Lei, what did you do?

233
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
I slept and played games at home.

234
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,000
Never mind.

235
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,440
How about you, Si?

236
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,360
You must have been happy
on your date with Shancai.

237
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,400
What's there to be happy about?

238
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,560
Did you two fight again?

239
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,160
No way.

240
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,440
Is Shancai that hard to figure out?

241
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,360
Who says Shancai is the problem?

242
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
Si.

243
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,320
You have a bad temper.

244
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,320
You're wrong.

245
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,760
How could Si be the problem?

246
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,080
Si has always been
straightforward and honest.

247
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,600
His temper is just a little bit bad.

248
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,760
But is that a crime?

249
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,120
That's right.

250
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,840
It's all Shancai's fault.

251
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,120
-Who knew Shancai's IQ would be so low?
-That's right.

252
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
Falling in love with a person with low IQ

253
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,920
-will also make your IQ low.
-Are you done talking?

254
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,720
You're babbling! Aren't you tired?

255
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,440
Lei. Did we say anything wrong?

256
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,960
The point is that you didn't say
anything wrong.

257
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
That's why Si walked out.

258
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,640
Si doesn't have the capability
to date girls.

259
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,720
The problem is right in front of us.

260
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,080
We all see it very clearly.

261
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,080
The problem is how do we solve it?

262
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
Indeed.

263
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,320
Si will end up dying alone
if he stays this way.

264
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,120
At that time, if nobody will push
his wheelchair to let him get some sun,

265
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,560
we'd all be sad when we see that, right?

266
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,400
So what should we do?

267
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,760
TALENT'S TEA SHOP
COME IN AND RECEIVE A GIFT

268
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
Shancai. How was your holiday?

269
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Don't even mention it.

270
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,480
I really hope I can go back in time.

271
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,160
Why?

272
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
Nothing.

273
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm not in the mood to think about it.

274
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's just sell milk tea.

275
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,240
Yes. If we don't sell enough of them,

276
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,000
we won't receive
our bonus again this month.

277
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,400
We haven't received our bonus
for three months already.

278
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
There's nothing we can do.

279
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,680
The weather's so cold.
Nobody wants to go out and buy tea.

280
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,880
Shancai.

281
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,840
That "different" guy is here.

282
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,160
Lei.

283
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Why are you guys here?

284
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,800
Hi, Ximen.

285
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,800
Long time no see. Welcome to our store.

286
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,760
Hi, Xiaoyou.

287
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
How are you doing?

288
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Long time no see.

289
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
You're still so cute.

290
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Don't look directly at this guy.
It's very dangerous.

291
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Shancai, you're so busy.

292
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
It's the holidays
but you're still working.

293
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,480
How can I rest when I have
a part-time job?

294
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,280
How can I earn a lot of money
if I don't work hard?

295
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,080
That's Dong Shancai.

296
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,240
Why exactly are you guys here?

297
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
You're not buying milk tea.
You're just getting in the way of our job.

298
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,840
If our sales don't increase
by the end of the year,

299
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,640
we won't get any bonus for this year.

300
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,360
Leave it all up to us.

301
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,040
Hey, pretty girl, come and taste
our store's new milk tea flavors.

302
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
Try the White Jasmine Dew.

303
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,360
The tea is very refreshing.

304
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
This is Peach Red Royale.

305
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
It's sweet with a fruity fragrance.

306
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
There are many flavors to choose from.

307
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,640
-Do you want to try this?
-Yes.

308
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,400
-He's so handsome!
-Hey, handsome.

309
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
-Can I have your Weibo ID?
-And...

310
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
This is yours.

311
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,440
-I like this.
-This latte and cheese are good.

312
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,040
-I like it too.
-And it's not fattening.

313
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,320
-If you order...
-Don't push me.

314
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
-Bye, handsome.
-Which tea do you want?

315
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,240
-This is your Peach Red Royale.
-Thank you.

316
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,000
-Welcome to our store. What's your order?
-I want what she's having.

317
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,640
-Do you want ice on it?
-No.

318
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,080
Do you want to try it?

319
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,240
That's right. I really recommend this.

320
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,680
They're so handsome.

321
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,040
-It smells really good.
-Do you want to try it?

322
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,320
TALENT'S TEA SHOP

323
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,840
It's so amazing!

324
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,720
Today's sales are even higher
than the past three months altogether.

325
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
Mission accomplished.

326
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm giving you extra on your bonuses.

327
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,440
Here. These are for you.

328
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,920
-Thank you, ma'am!
-Thank you, ma'am!

329
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,360
You're welcome.

330
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,960
Keep up the good work!

331
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,600
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

332
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,760
Thank you for what you guys did today.

333
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,360
I've never gotten a bonus this big.

334
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,640
No.

335
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
I can't accept this bonus. You were the ones who sold
those milk teas.

336
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,840
Take this.

337
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,520
We sold them outside.

338
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,160
You prepared them inside.

339
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
It was teamwork.

340
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,440
How can you say that you don't deserve it?

341
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,240
Do you want to return that to your boss?

342
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,360
Then all our efforts this afternoon
would be wasted.

343
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Just accept it, Shancai.

344
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,840
We helped out just for you.

345
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,800
All right.

346
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll treat you guys for dinner
as a reward for your efforts.

347
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
That's right. We can all eat together.

348
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,320
Shancai, if you really want
to treat us for dinner,

349
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,800
how about using this money
to have fun with us instead?

350
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,760
Have fun? Where?

351
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,920
We're going to Canada
during the New Year holidays.

352
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,360
And we'll do the countdown there.

353
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,080
What?

354
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
Canada?

355
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,280
Join us, Xiaoyou.

356
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,280
Really? Can I really go with you?
I've never been out of the country before.

357
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,960
But...

358
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,240
Is this enough to go to Canada?

359
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,480
Don't worry.

360
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,280
Si's family has a chalet mansion
with a very nice view in Canada.

361
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,000
Food and lodging would not be a problem.

362
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,520
Shancai, let's go with them.
I really want to go.

363
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,920
I want to go too.

364
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,360
But...

365
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,800
Daoming Si would probably be there too.

366
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,040
We had such a big fight.

367
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,360
How can I pretend like nothing happened

368
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
and stay at his mansion?

369
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
-I'm home.
-You're back?

370
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
Shancai.

371
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,320
I heard that you're going to Canada
in a couple of days.

372
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
Remember to buy smoked salmon for me.

373
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,920
Yes. And maple syrup.

374
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,280
Buy a few bottles.

375
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,920
I heard the stewed chicken leg
is delicious there.

376
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,080
How did you know?

377
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,960
Ximen called and told us about it.

378
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,400
Ximen?

379
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
I haven't even agreed yet.

380
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm still thinking about it. What's there to think about?

381
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,360
I think it's good to go out
and see the world.

382
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,200
I'm usually busy with school.

383
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I need to accompany Mom to the market
to buy ingredients during the holidays.

384
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,880
Don't worry about that. We only have a few days
of holiday vacation.

385
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,000
It's the New Year.

386
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,120
You must be really busy with cooking.
I have to help you with the deliveries.

387
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,800
Don't worry. I'm here.

388
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,160
My working hours are quite flexible.

389
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,760
That's right.

390
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,880
Don't worry about these things.
Your dad and I will take care of it.

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,440
You rarely have a chance to go out
and have fun. Enjoy yourself.

392
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,400
Your friends can take care of you
and you won't be alone. Isn't that great?

393
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,560
It's good. Just go.

394
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,640
Remember to buy smoked salmon for me.

395
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,800
Shancai, are you still thinking about it?

396
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm still worried about my family's
food business.

397
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,040
Do you really want to go?

398
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
Yes. I want to go to Canada with you.

399
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,840
But...

400
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,160
I haven't made up my mind yet.

401
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,720
DAOMING SI CALLING FROM QQ

402
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
I heard you're going to Canada.

403
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,760
So what?

404
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,240
What has that got to do with you?

405
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,280
Of course!
If you're going, I'm staying behind.

406
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
What do you mean?

407
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,720
Let me make it even clearer.

408
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
You can't go to Canada.

409
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,440
Daoming Si, who are you to stop me
from going to Canada?

410
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
It's too luxurious
for a stupid girl like you.

411
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,280
You don't know how to ski
and you're afraid of the cold.

412
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,600
You won't enjoy it there.

413
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,400
I think you shouldn't go.

414
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,600
Who says so?

415
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm not afraid of the cold.

416
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,560
I'll enjoy it even if I fall while skiing!

417
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm definitely going!

418
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,960
And I'll go there happily.

419
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,320
I didn't invite you to go.

420
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,000
And I don't want to see you.

421
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,400
You weren't the one who invited me there.

422
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,680
If you don't want to see me,
then don't go!

423
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,840
I don't need your approval for my actions!

424
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,880
Fine, I'm not going!
I'll tell them all not to go.

425
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,080
Just go alone.

426
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,520
When you encounter wild animals
in the wilderness,

427
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,160
don't call and cry to me!

428
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,040
Cry?

429
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,520
You think too little of me.

430
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
It's better to encounter wild animals
than beasts like you!

431
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,440
-Bye!
-Goodbye!

432
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Si, why did you think we sold milk tea
in such a cold weather?

433
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,160
You guys like to sell milk tea.
What does that have to do with me?

434
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,840
In life, it's very lucky
to have good friends.

435
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,520
It's also very unlucky to meet Daoming Si.

436
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,840
Lei.

437
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
You can freely court Shancai now.

438
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Si and Shancai are now enemies.

439
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,280
He wouldn't care
about what happens with you and Shancai.

440
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,680
Really? I'll do that then.

441
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
Don't regret it.

442
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,560
Don't play tricks with me!
I said I'm not going so I'm not going!

443
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,520
Then don't go.

444
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,960
That's right. Nobody's forcing you to go.

445
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,720
Let's go and pack.

446
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,320
We'll leave you all alone
in Shanghai then.

447
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,320
We'll go.

448
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,640
-Si.
-Bye.

449
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,320
We're leaving.

450
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Si. Have a happy holiday!

451
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,520
Really? You've decided to go to Canada?

452
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,920
My parents encouraged me to go.

453
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,480
Your parents are so nice.

454
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,040
Yes.

455
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,000
Daoming Si is not going anyway.

456
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,840
Then I don't have any reason not to go.

457
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,960
Honestly, I really wanted to go.

458
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
Yes. Let's go together.

459
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,040
Shancai, you're so nice.

460
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
I love you to death!

461
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,840
What should we wear in Canada?

462
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,200
Let's take a selfie and post it in QQ
to celebrate our trip to Canada, okay?

463
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,160
Sure.

464
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,200
DONG SHANCAI: GOING TO CANADA
WITH MY BESTIE, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

465
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,960
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
ANNOYING PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING!

466
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,440
GOING TO CANADA WITH MY BESTIE,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

467
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Xinhui. Xinhui.

468
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,840
-What? I'm not done trying yet.
-Come here and see this.

469
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,800
Shancai is going to Canada.

470
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,720
Shancai?

471
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,160
Is she going with Daoming Si?

472
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
F4.

473
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,920
I want to go too.

474
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,120
Can I go?

475
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,720
It's impossible.

476
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,000
How about we call Shancai?

477
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,640
Let's ask if we can go with them.

478
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,520
F4.

479
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,160
I was too excited to sleep all night
thinking about going to Canada with you.

480
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,360
I searched online
for the places we can go.

481
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
Canada's snow is so pretty.

482
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,040
Shancai. I saw your post in QQ.
Are you going to Canada for the New Year?

483
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,640
You said you're going with your bestie.

484
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,640
Who's that?

485
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,200
My friend from senior high school.

486
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,240
Xiaoyou.

487
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,560
We're all classmates.

488
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
Let us go with you.

489
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,680
But it was Ximen who invited me.

490
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,200
Then I'll call Ximen
and tell him that you invited us.

491
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
Shancai.

492
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
Don't you consider us your close friends?

493
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,280
Could it be that you were referring
to Xinhui and me on QQ when you said,

494
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,480
"It's a good thing that
annoying people are not coming"?

495
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,400
No, I wasn't talking about you.

496
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,280
Good. It's settled then.

497
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,840
I'll tell Ximen later
that you invited us to go to Canada.

498
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,400
Thanks, Shancai.

499
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,760
It's so beautiful.

500
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,720
Yes. What a beautiful mansion!

501
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,160
Let's go.

502
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,360
-We finally arrived.
-Yes.

503
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,840
Why is the fireplace burning?

504
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,400
Did the attendant come
and prepare the fire first?

505
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,239
Daoming Si.

506
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,199
You're so late.

507
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,639
What kind of plane can be that slow?

508
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,040
Si, how did you arrive before us?

509
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,280
Yes. I even had time to go
around the city and eat ice cream.

510
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,760
I bought yours too.

511
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,840
It's good that you're here.

512
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,840
Lei, aren't you cold?

513
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,840
Eating ice cream in front
of the fireplace sounds interesting.

514
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,280
-Hi, Daoming Si.
-Hi, Daoming Si.

515
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,840
Stupid girl, you came anyway.

516
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,520
I should be the one saying that.

517
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
Somebody said he's not coming
but he has come secretly?

518
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,920
Whose words cannot be trusted?

519
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,240
Get your facts straight. This is my house.

520
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,240
I can come anytime I want.

521
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
If you're not happy about it,
you can go home now.

522
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
-Daoming Si, you--
-That's enough.

523
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,640
We came all the way here.

524
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,240
Just get along.

525
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,800
Si, can you mellow out a bit?

526
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,560
Stop flirting with each other.

527
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
-Who's flirting with whom?
-Who's flirting with whom?

528
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,800
This is so comfortable.

529
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,280
I've always wanted to just
lie down here like this.

530
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,320
I never thought the handsome Daoming Si
would be so scary when he's mad.

531
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,120
He's handsome?

532
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,640
Which part?

533
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,080
You don't think he's handsome
because you're mad right now.

534
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,040
But this vacation house is really great.

535
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm able to come here because of you.

536
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,760
Not really.

537
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,200
Isn't this our first trip together after
we graduated from senior high school?

538
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,000
This is so nice.

539
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,200
I'm so happy!

540
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,040
Xiaoyou.

541
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,880
Let's have a snowball fight!

542
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,760
Okay!

543
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,880
Jiang Xiaoyou.

544
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,680
You hit me.

545
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,640
I'm dying from so many hits.

546
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,160
Come on.

547
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,920
Can't you and Shancai get along?

548
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,240
How long will you be fighting like this?

549
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,440
Who's fighting with her?

550
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
I'm so angry with her.

551
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm the victim.

552
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,840
It's no use being nice
to that stupid girl.

553
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,720
Is that so? Isn't that so?

554
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,800
Are you all right?

555
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,360
Daoming Si.

556
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,440
Why are you so childish?

557
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,400
You deserved it.

558
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,120
Look where you're going.

559
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,480
Are you stupid?

560
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,360
-Daoming Si, you jerk!
-Hey!

561
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,520
What are you doing?

562
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,080
Daoming Si!

563
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,680
Calm down. Hey!

564
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,960
Calm down!

565
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,720
I'll really get my revenge on him.

566
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,080
Xiaoyou, you can shower now.

567
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,720
Shancai, the picture of the snow
you sent earlier was so nice.

568
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,480
Just enjoy yourself.

569
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,720
I'm with you in spirit.

570
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,920
Don't forget to bring back some
smoked salmon and maple syrup.

571
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,520
I know.

572
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,920
I won't forget to bring them back to you.

573
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,840
Xiaoyou, I already showered.

574
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,080
Come back now.

575
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,360
I'M NOT TELLING YOU! LOG IN

576
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,040
I MAKE THE DECISIONS

577
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
I MAKE THE DECISIONS

578
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
Shancai, this lousy teammate.

579
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,080
She's still playing this?

580
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,520
What happened to Xiaoyou?

581
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,640
She's still not back yet.

582
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
Lei, have you seen Xiaoyou?

583
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,600
Which one is Xiaoyou?

584
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
I'll just find her myself.

585
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,000
Excuse me.

586
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,760
Have you seen Xiaoyou?

587
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,440
Xiaoyou?

588
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,960
-The one from the snowball fight?
-Yes.

589
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Have you seen her?

590
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,800
Oh, that's Xiaoyou.

591
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,840
Let me think.

592
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,200
It looked like she went out
to see the night view.

593
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,320
Yes.

594
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,640
About ten minutes ago,

595
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,320
I saw her walk out the door
with her coat on.

596
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,560
See the night view?

597
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,520
But it's snowing outside.

598
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
She insisted on going
for a walk around the area.

599
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,680
We forgot to remind her.

600
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,960
She might not find her way back
if she walks all alone in the snow.

601
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,120
Could she have gotten lost?

602
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,760
Shancai, where are you going?

603
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,680
I'm going to find Xiaoyou.
She went out to see the night view.

604
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,280
But it's a blizzard out there.

605
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,920
I'll search for her around the area.
I'll be right back.

606
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,440
What should we do?

607
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,080
They really went out.

608
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,160
Lei went with her anyway.

609
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,360
They should be back soon
if they can't find her.

610
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,640
Let's go.
