A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 26

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,440
So is Shancai safe?

4
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Did my mom meet her?

5
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,080
Should I go over there?

6
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
Stay put for now.

7
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,240
You're going to make things worse
if you come back.

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,040
Shancai is in my room now.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
Don't worry.

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
We'll talk again tomorrow.

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,120
Enough for now.

12
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
-I'm hanging up.
-Hey.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
This damn old woman.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,760
She hung up without saying anything.

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,760
She said enough.

16
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,360
At least she should let me
talk to Shancai.

17
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
What's up with hanging up like that?

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Don't worry.

19
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Ms. Yu won't lie to you.

20
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,240
That's right.

21
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,080
If something was wrong,

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,880
Shancai would've called you. You think so?

23
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,880
Trust me.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
Go to sleep. Worry about it tomorrow.

25
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
All right.

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,400
Can you turn around?

27
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,600
Why can't you turn the other way?

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
I'll say "three" and we both turn.

29
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Three.

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,000
What now?

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Sleeping butt to butt feels too awkward.

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,800
What do you want then?

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Upside down.

34
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,480
Feet to head.

35
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,480
I can't be sleeping facing your feet.

36
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
Wait.

37
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,400
You don't want to see my head or my face

38
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
You don't like sleeping back to back
and even head to toe!

39
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
What do you want then?

40
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,760
What did Ms. Yu mean?

41
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,560
What was on Ms. Yu's mind?

42
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,160
The secret trick

43
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
is to sprinkle rose petals

44
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
on Si's bed.

45
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,080
Then light a candle.

46
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,480
Play Chou Jie Lun's "Confession Balloon."

47
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,360
And then,

48
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
the baby comes.

49
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
-You won't have to leave the house.
-That's...

50
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,720
That's too fast.

51
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
Of course.

52
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,280
I've been waiting anxiously.

53
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,200
Si's a grown man.

54
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,960
I really hope to see
the family's fourth generation.

55
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,240
Do you think we are cell phones
that could be updated that quickly?

56
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Do you have any idea how to have a baby?

57
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,800
What kind of stupid trick is that?

58
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Shancai.

59
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Hi.

60
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Good morning.

61
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,480
What's up with you?

62
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
Nothing.

63
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
Shancai.

64
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,080
I think you've been unhappy
since you started dating Daoming Si.

65
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,280
-Tell me if you have any problems.
-Stop being nosy.

66
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,720
She's busy being in love,
she has no time to sleep, okay?

67
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
Why can't she sleep if she's in love? Do you want them to sleep together?

68
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,400
Of course not.

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,520
Stop talking nonsense, you two.

70
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,160
Okay, tell me then.

71
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
Have you been well lately?

72
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Why does it concern you
whether she is well or not?

73
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,160
Step aside.

74
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,600
Shancai, you met my mom again.

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,920
Did anything happen?

76
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,200
Ms. Yu is staying with us.
Of course nothing has happened.

77
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Why are you staring at me?

78
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
Come.

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,080
-Where to?
-Shancai.

80
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,280
Shancai!

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,520
Hey.

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
Hey.

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,320
Where are you taking me?

84
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,480
Rabbit Hole.

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,440
Rabbit Hole?

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,920
Your favorite shop.
You've been wanting to go, right?

87
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,480
This looks nice.

88
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,680
Try this.

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,120
Shancai, what's so nice about this place?

90
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,080
Thanks for waiting.
Here are the Pink Bubble cakes.

91
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,520
-So cute!
-Enjoy.

92
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,919
I've been craving these.

93
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
Delicious.

94
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,960
Why are you just drinking coffee?
Order some cakes.

95
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,080
No, thanks.

96
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
Order a different flavor

97
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,840
so we can share.

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
Do you want a taste?

99
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,760
Just try it.
How do you know it's not good?

100
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Hurry up. My arm is aching.

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,280
You're so pushy.

102
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,560
So sweet.

103
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,080
How do you eat these things?

104
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,240
Cakes are supposed to be sweet.
If not, why eat cake?

105
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,600
Do girls like to eat these things?

106
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes.

107
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,400
Eating sweet stuff makes us happy.

108
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,320
Can you tell me now?

109
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,840
About what?

110
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,080
Tell me what really happened last night.

111
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,600
It wasn't a big deal.

112
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
Have you ever been to Ms. Yu's room?

113
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
She invited me to her room
for tea yesterday.

114
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
Whether it be the shaming from his mom

115
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,280
or Ms. Yu's secret plan,

116
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,760
I can't let Daoming Si know.

117
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
Telling him will only cause more problems.

118
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,400
By the way, Ms. Yu told me about your dad.

119
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,560
I think your dad is incredible.

120
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,960
Do you look like him?

121
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
Why are you asking?

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
I'm curious.

123
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,400
Did you get your fighting skills
from your dad?

124
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
No.

125
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,520
I know. You must have gotten it
from your mom.

126
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Yes, I can tell from your mom's physique

127
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
that she's a formidable fighter.

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,760
-Shancai.
-Yes?

129
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,880
I want to move out.

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,040
What?

131
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,600
You want to move out?

132
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,000
What does that mean?

133
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,080
Do you know what moving out means?

134
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
It means staying on my own.

135
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,480
How do you plan on staying on your own?

136
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,160
What is there to plan?

137
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,880
It will just be a slightly smaller place
than the current house.

138
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,680
Hey, sir.

139
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,200
Let me ask you.

140
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Do you know if

141
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,640
the electric heater in your house
is switched on before or after you shower?

142
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
I know.

143
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Do you know what's the right voltage
for the induction cooker?

144
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes.

145
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,680
No maids.

146
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,160
You need to cook.

147
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,400
You'll need to settle
the utility bills every month.

148
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,360
Do you know all that?

149
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,480
You're nagging.

150
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,280
I know how tough it is

151
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,640
-so I want you to know before...
-If I don't move out,

152
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
how will I protect you?

153
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,360
Because of me,

154
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,640
many things are unravelling.

155
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,120
I can't put into words
the gratitude I feel for Daoming Si.

156
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,280
But I know in my heart
that he's not doing the right thing.

157
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,880
Let's go.

158
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
-Where to?
-To a housing agency.

159
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,160
-Stop fooling around.
-Nobody is fooling around.

160
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,760
-Everything I said was true.
-That's why I'm scared.

161
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,960
I really don't get you.
You always drive me up the wall.

162
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
All right.

163
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,920
I won't nag.

164
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,520
Let's go.

165
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,600
Where to?

166
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,040
You're pulling my arm off.

167
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
Why do you walk so slow
with those long legs?

168
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,480
Hold on.

169
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,280
Is this the fun place you said?

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
These are for kids.

171
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
You said you didn't like
pink places, right?

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
Come on. Let's have some fun.

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,880
Over there.

174
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,200
-Faster! Hurry.
-I'll destroy you!

175
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
You're dead!

176
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,280
I'll kill all of you!

177
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,440
SUCCESS!

178
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
I'm amazing, right?

179
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,120
Si.

180
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
Is she your friend?

181
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Yes.

182
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,040
Then please escort her out.

183
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,800
If you dare to walk out this door,
be prepared for the consequences.

184
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,960
If a stumbling block appears in your life,

185
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,320
you'd remove it too, right?

186
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,160
I will never allow such an unrefined girl

187
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
to be in my house.

188
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,800
Hey.

189
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
You must have kept it all inside.

190
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,360
No.

191
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
Something must have happened yesterday.
Am I right?

192
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,640
I told you nothing happened.

193
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,000
I knew it.

194
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,200
You must have the gene
of a mutant beast in your body.

195
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,360
I didn't even give it my all.
Who knew that thing would break so easily?

196
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,520
-Barbaric.
-You're the same too.

197
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,560
Nobody would want to marry
such a strong girl.

198
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Whatever.

199
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,800
I deal with my everyday life
using this exact strength.

200
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,920
Got a problem?

201
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,360
You're always showing off
how strong you are.

202
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,400
Not feminine at all.

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,680
You can always look for a delicate,
weak girl to be your girlfriend.

204
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,360
Are you crazy?
You're picking a fight, aren't you?

205
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,000
That's the truth.

206
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,600
You're weird yourself.

207
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,000
Most guys prefer that kind of girl.

208
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,560
Who said so?

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,760
It doesn't concern me. I'm not like that.

210
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,320
So what about you?

211
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,520
Which type are you?

212
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,280
Which type are you? Tell me.

213
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,120
Which type are you?

214
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,040
Which one?

215
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,280
What I mean is

216
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,520
I only like you.

217
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Why are you saying that so suddenly?

218
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,760
You made me.

219
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,080
Didn't you see the stairs?

220
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,760
You need to watch where you're going.

221
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm not a three-year-old, you know.

222
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,440
In my eyes, you're just like a kid
who needs to be protected.

223
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,640
You're exaggerating.

224
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,520
Since when do I make people worry?

225
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
All the time.

226
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,520
I worry about you all the time.

227
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah, right.

228
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,079
My parents are back at the village,
but I'm doing fine by myself in Shanghai.

229
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,920
I work and earn money for my own expenses.
I have multiple jobs.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
I'm a cleaner at your house,
and nobody talked about it.

231
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,280
I'm fine all by myself.

232
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,280
So how long are you going
to get by on your own?

233
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,280
In your eyes, am I really that unreliable?

234
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,280
That's not it.

235
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,480
Then why won't you tell me?

236
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,640
Do you think I can't tell
that you're unhappy?

237
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,520
Sorry.

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,720
I just feel that

239
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,360
they're my own problems.

240
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,720
They don't concern you.

241
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,160
Right.

242
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
Whatever happens to you
is unrelated to me.

243
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,080
Just like you don't need me.

244
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Daoming Si.

245
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,600
I didn't mean it that way.

246
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,000
Are you still not getting it?

247
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,120
You don't get me either.

248
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm worried about you.

249
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,000
It has nothing to do with you
being a superwoman or not.

250
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,240
I don't want you to leave the house.

251
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,280
This woman...

252
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Can't you see I'm doing it for you?

253
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,400
I know.

254
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Then why?

255
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
We're a couple.

256
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,720
The effort we put in the relationship
should be balanced.

257
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,640
If I'm overly reliant on you,

258
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,400
we'll lose this balance.

259
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,480
I know this doesn't make me cute at all.

260
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm stubborn and unreasonable.

261
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,440
But I hope you can accept the way I am.

262
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,000
One more thing.

263
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,760
Knowing that you're willing to leave
the house for me,

264
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm touched.

265
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm so happy.

266
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
So...

267
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,640
I'm going home.

268
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,640
I, Dong Shancai,
am not a weak girl who can't live

269
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,360
without a man's protection.

270
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,520
But I do appreciate your concern.
Thank you, Daoming Si.

271
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,600
What's up with him?

272
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
No idea.

273
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,080
The one behind you is weird too.

274
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Hey, give it back!

275
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,560
What is that?

276
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
Did a woman take weird photos of you

277
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,080
and you're being threatened?

278
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,560
Not that kind of photos.

279
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,800
Why are you so nervous then?

280
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,600
I'm not interested in any woman.

281
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,080
Lei.

282
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm sure he's hiding something.

283
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Let me see.

284
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,040
Hey!

285
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,280
Just let me see.

286
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,640
-Stop it.
-Show it to me.

287
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,280
-Hey.
-No, I won't.

288
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,440
-Stop it.
-Let me see.

289
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,680
-Stop it.
-Just a glimpse.

290
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,200
Hey, you guys.

291
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,320
Grow up, will you?

292
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,440
I'm saying,
you should stop fooling around.

293
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,880
Having a serious relationship
trumps everything else.

294
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
What did I just hear?

295
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,200
Our Si actually said
the word "relationship."

296
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,640
People that don't feel it
with their heart won't understand.

297
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,680
Looks like something good happened.

298
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
Not just good.

299
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,680
Today is the happiest day

300
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,680
of my life.

301
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,440
What happened?

302
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
I'm not telling you.

303
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
Hey.

304
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Telling you guys will spoil the happiness.

305
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,720
I'm also starting

306
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,320
a very serious relationship.

307
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,760
Si's love story has ended.
Now you're starting your act?

308
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
What do you mean "a serious relationship"?

309
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,640
No.

310
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,280
Don't be too quick to jump the gun.

311
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,360
First, we need to see this girl.

312
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,640
Zhou Caina?

313
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,520
The champion of Chinese Cuisine
Culinary Competition.

314
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,480
That person?

315
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,400
I ran into her a few times.

316
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,480
She seems like an interesting girl.

317
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,320
So?

318
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,280
Even if it's Zhou Caina,

319
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,480
you're the outstanding Meizuo of F4.

320
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,480
-She'd be an easy catch.
-I didn't say I couldn't get her.

321
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,680
Then why are you so anxious?

322
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,200
The one in the photo just now
is her, right?

323
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,040
Going after girls isn't that hard.
But this is Caina we're talking about.

324
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,080
The problem is

325
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
I need to first get rid

326
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,280
of Mr. Obstacle.

327
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
What kind of crazy photo is this?

328
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Did something happen
between Zhou Caina and this man?

329
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,280
How did you know?

330
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,960
-Everyone would've guessed.
-How?

331
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
It's not printed on their foreheads.

332
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,280
Does Zhou Caina still like him?

333
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,760
To put it simply,

334
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,720
they didn't end their relationship
on a good note.

335
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
I'm not anxious or anything.

336
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,680
I just want Mr. Obstacle
out of the picture

337
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,320
without hurting Caina too much.

338
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,120
I want him to willingly disappear.

339
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

340
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
What?

341
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
All you need to do is beat him up.

342
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,200
Please. We don't support violence.

343
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,880
He only knows how to fight.

344
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,320
Hey.

345
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,280
What's wrong with fighting?

346
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,040
-Don't.
-Don't.

347
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,520
When you meet the man again,

348
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,240
give him a compliment.

349
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,240
Give a compliment?

350
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,360
Yes.

351
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,400
Make sure you do it in front of Caina.

352
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,360
You mean,

353
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,120
the ultimate strategy
in adult love philosophy?

354
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,680
Mr. Lu, this spanner doesn't work.

355
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,080
-Give me the pliers.
-Okay.

356
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,400
Can you do it? Let me.

357
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,600
It's okay. I'll do it.

358
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,440
Your phone.

359
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,000
Hello?

360
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,440
Hi, Caina.

361
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,200
Do you want to go
to a violin recital tonight?

362
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
I can't. Something happened at home.

363
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,160
What's wrong?

364
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,480
It's nothing. Just a leak.

365
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,040
I'll talk to you later.

366
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,720
I told you, there's a leak at my house.

367
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,680
I can't go.

368
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
A leak in the house?

369
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,600
Why?

370
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,320
Is something wrong with the house?

371
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
It's you.

372
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,600
Can you do it?

373
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,360
Maybe I should just call the plumber.

374
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
Thanks.

375
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,440
You must check all the pipes in the house.

376
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,120
Okay. I'll get a plumber to come.

377
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,200
That day, you--

378
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,160
I wanted to ask you...

379
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,640
Why exactly did you call me just now?

380
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,240
Mr. Lu, I did a quick check.

381
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,920
The pipes in the kitchen and bathroom
are in bad condition.

382
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,480
Get a plumber to fix them.

383
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,720
Okay, thanks.

384
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,440
Can you also check her bedroom
while you're here?

385
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,400
I think the ceiling is broken.
It leaks when it rains.

386
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,960
Okay.

387
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
Where's the room?

388
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
It's upstairs.

389
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,080
Wait!

390
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,680
Wait a minute.

391
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,280
I guess he doesn't remember after all.

392
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,840
It's fine if he doesn't.

393
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
I've checked your bedroom.

394
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,400
It's not a big problem.

395
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,280
Just ask the plumber to fix it up.

396
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,400
Thank you.

397
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,680
I'll be going then.

398
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,320
Wait.

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,640
Did you see anything in my room just now?

400
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,720
-No.
-Nothing at all?

401
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,760
Was there anything I was supposed to see?

402
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,520
If you didn't see anything,

403
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,160
you can go then.

404
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,760
What a coincidence.

405
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,320
My boyfriend is here to take me out.

406
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,240
What is Terence doing here?

407
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,280
He came to fix the leak.

408
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,760
Don't bother yourself
with Caina's problems in the future.

409
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,760
I'll be here to help her.

410
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
You came too late.

411
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,440
I've already fixed the pipes.

412
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,240
Did you come here quicker than me
because you're a professional plumber?

413
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
Caina and I are old friends.

414
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,000
It's only right to help her
with simple things.

415
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,120
As Caina's boyfriend,

416
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,840
I should properly thank you then.

417
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,960
It's okay.

418
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
We should thank this guy
who fixed the pipes.

419
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Or else he might come back
to ask for repayment.

420
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,480
You're welcome.

421
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,040
Bye.

422
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,840
That Terence can't seem
to stay away from you.

423
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,080
It's not what you think.

424
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,720
He just came here to help fix the pipes.

425
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,640
Are you pretending to be naive?

426
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,480
That's what I think.

427
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,680
Only a guy can see through another guy.

428
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,840
I can see it.

429
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,960
Just now and the time at the bar,

430
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,800
he expected something more from you.

431
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
He wouldn't expect anything from me.

432
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,240
If he does, what will you do?

433
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
So what if he does?

434
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,520
A one-night-stand is the worst.

435
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,680
A genuine and lasting relationship

436
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,560
must be based on understanding and growth.

437
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,360
Such a relationship takes time.

438
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,560
Both parties must get to know each other.

439
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
That's how a relationship can be strong

440
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,600
and everlasting.

441
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,720
Remember what you said?

442
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,240
Did you mean it when you called me
your boyfriend?

443
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,960
-I was just--
-It's okay.

444
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,680
You might not be serious,

445
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,400
but I am.

446
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,960
Besides, I'm confident

447
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,080
that I'll make you fall for me.

448
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,640
Meizuo.

449
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,240
-Where do you get your confidence from?
-Because I want to see you smile

450
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,560
every moment of my life.

451
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,760
Dong Shancai.

452
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,520
What have you done?

453
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,400
Jeez.

454
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,080
It didn't kill you anyway.

455
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
In some countries,

456
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,120
that's how people greet each other.

457
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,920
It's fine for a girl like me
to kiss him first.

458
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,199
It doesn't have to mean anything.

459
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,679
What were you saying?

460
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,120
It's fine for a girl to...

461
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Huaze Lei.

462
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,400
When did you get here?

463
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,800
"It didn't kill you anyway."

464
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,440
"In some countries,
that's how people greet each other."

465
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,760
Did you and Si...

466
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,000
kiss?

467
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,760
Why were you eavesdropping?

468
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,679
Shancai,

469
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,159
you didn't mumble. I could hear you.

470
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,320
So you kissed him first?

471
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,560
It must be nice, right?

472
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,840
I didn't kiss him first. Stop speculating.

473
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,400
Doing that wasn't...

474
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,720
that different from a Christmas wish.

475
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Okay.

476
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,920
Then give me a kiss too.

477
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,440
Wish me a Merry Christmas.

478
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,600
Hurry up.

479
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,160
Come on. See?

480
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,600
You can't do it, can you?

481
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,040
That "Christmas wish"
isn't for just anybody.

482
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,520
Shancai. Yes?

483
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,640
How are things with Si's mom?

484
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
What do you mean?

485
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,040
Did she kick you out?

486
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
No.

487
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,560
She almost kicked me out.

488
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,800
But Ms. Yu stopped her.

489
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,280
And?

490
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
That's all.

491
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,960
Did anything weird happen to you?

492
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,160
Anything weird?

493
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't think so.

494
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,240
You have a friend
who went to Canada with us, right?

495
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,640
Xiaoyou?

496
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,720
Yes. What about her?

497
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,480
You need to go check on her.

498
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,920
Maybe something has happened.

499
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,320
Why?

500
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,160
Si's mom probably already
did something to her.

501
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
That's impossible.

502
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,760
This has nothing to do with Xiaoyou.

503
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,120
Besides, it's way too soon.

504
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,720
Do you know who you're dealing with?

505
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,360
Si's mom is a powerful figure
of the food chain business.

506
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,240
Most people must spend

507
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,360
half their lives to accomplish something.

508
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,720
Si's mom can do so only in 15 minutes.

509
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,360
Also, don't forget.

510
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,040
You'll never know
where she will strike next.

511
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,360
She's Si's mom.

512
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,080
She knows Si inside out.

513
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,960
Stopping him will only make him
rebel even more.

514
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,360
So she's targeting you instead.

515
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,000
But she didn't expect

516
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,640
that her constant pressure on you
didn't yield any results.

517
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,560
She can no longer target your family.

518
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
If she wants to topple you

519
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
or attack you more efficiently,

520
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,600
she'll have to start with your friends.

521
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,080
What is she going to do? What can she do?

522
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
People make mistakes.

523
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
But Si's mom...

524
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,520
To be at the top in a cutthroat
business industry means...

525
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,560
Hi, your drinks are ready.
Please come again.

526
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,520
Thanks.

527
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,960
TRANSFER OF 2,800 YUAN INTO YOUR SAVINGS.
BALANCE, 21,600 YUAN.

528
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,200
MOM CALLING

529
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,120
Mom, what's up?

530
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,080
What?

531
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,520
You're moving now? So boring.

532
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,040
Shancai disappeared right after class.

533
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,000
I bet Daoming Si kidnapped her.

534
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,600
If you want, you can kidnap Shancai too.

535
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Mr. Single.

536
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,440
Who are you calling Mr. Single?

537
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,120
I'm so busy picking up calls every day.

538
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,040
DAD CALLING

539
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,680
If you don't pick up soon,

540
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,880
your dad's hanging up.

541
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,960
Hey, Dad.

542
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I'm at school.

543
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,120
What?

544
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,480
The company what?

545
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,080
She won't attack without any reason.

546
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,960
But if the other party trips

547
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,720
and shows any signs of weakness,

548
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,040
then you can't blame her
for making the move.

549
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Shancai, I'm not trying to scare you.

550
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,480
When you decided to go out with Si,

551
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,200
you should be ready to make sacrifices.

552
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Even if

553
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,560
they're important to you.

554
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,600
Your friend's parents

555
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,080
have business deals with Daoming Group.

556
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,000
It's a piece of cake

557
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,960
for her to control them.

558
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,080
Huaze Lei is overreacting.

559
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,400
Why?

560
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,280
Why are my friends dragged into this?

561
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,400
Li Zhen, where's Qinghe?

562
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,680
He just left.

563
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,360
There's an emergency at home.

564
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Hey!

565
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
The dominating aura of that woman

566
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,680
has seeped into every corner of my life.

567
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,800
She's going to do whatever it takes

568
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,360
to make me leave Daoming Si.

569
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,800
Xiaoyou?

570
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,760
-Are you...
-Shancai.

571
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,320
I don't think I'll see you again.

572
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,240
Where are you right now?

573
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,440
At home.

574
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Wait for me.

575
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,200
Shancai.

576
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,000
Qinghe.

577
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,400
Where are you going?

578
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,760
Something happened at home.

579
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,320
What happened?

580
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,120
Something's wrong my dad's contract
and it has resulted in some loss.

581
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,080
He's being sued.

582
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,760
No way.

583
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,640
My dad is talking with his lawyer.

584
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,400
I need to get home and see my mom.

585
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,760
Qinghe, I'm sorry.

586
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,400
It's my fault.

587
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,760
It's all my fault. Sorry.

588
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,720
Why are you apologizing
for my family's problem?

589
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,640
I...

590
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,160
I'll explain later.

591
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,120
Shancai.

592
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,320
Xiaoyou. Shancai.

593
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,160
My dad has been transferred to Qinghai.

594
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,840
He's probably not coming back to Shanghai.

595
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,800
Ma'am, I know why Mr. Jiang
is being transferred.

596
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,320
Don't pack up just yet.

597
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,480
Wait for a while.

598
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,560
I promise.

599
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,800
I promise Mr. Jiang will be able to stay.

600
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,560
Shancai, where are you going?

601
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,720
Is everything taken care of?

602
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,560
It's been carried out
according to your orders.

603
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,960
All good? Presumably.

604
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
It's a little slow.

605
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,680
That's on me. It won't happen again.

606
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
Don't worry.

607
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,280
I've always been fair in my judgment.

608
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,320
Prepare the afternoon tea
to greet our guest.

609
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,400
Yes.

610
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,440
I finally gathered my courage
and confessed my feelings.

611
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,120
Daoming Si and I can finally move
a step closer.

612
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,440
But why is this happening?

613
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,680
Instead of going down that path,

614
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,200
am I running the opposite way?
