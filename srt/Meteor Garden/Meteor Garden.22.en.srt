A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 22

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Huaze Lei.

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
I guess it's normal to feel offended

5
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
when you see someone being touchy-feely.

6
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,840
It does feel awkward
to be caught in the situation.

7
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,240
Usually, we'll just laugh
and brush it off.

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,920
But you care about it

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,160
because it's Daoming Si, right?

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Who said I care about it?

11
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,280
Besides,

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
it's good that they're doing well.

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,640
If you can't hold it in, it's fine to cry.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,120
You don't have to force yourself
to be strong.

15
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Can I lean on your back for a bit?

16
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

17
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Shancai, you're back. What's going on?

18
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Dad.

19
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,880
Did you make a bad investment again?

20
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
Or are you two...

21
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Your dad's boss ran away
with the company funds.

22
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,520
What? And you didn't stop him?

23
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
It's too late.

24
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
Right now, only the ones
who weren't involved are left.

25
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
Anything else that has any worth

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,400
has been taken away
by the bigger shareholders.

27
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
I'm sorry, my dear.

28
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,880
What are we going to do now?

29
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,440
Your dad and I will need to stay
at the village for a while.

30
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,240
Why?

31
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,480
We thought we could sustain for a bit

32
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
by doing deliveries
while your dad looks for another job.

33
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,680
But your aunt at the village called today

34
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,040
and said that your uncle is sick.

35
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,080
It's hard for her to care for him and make
a living by fishing at the same time.

36
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,280
So she asked if we could go and help her.

37
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
Is he okay?

38
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,680
He's not critical right now.

39
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,760
He'll need time to recover,
but it will take a while.

40
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
So...

41
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,960
Am I going to stay here by myself?

42
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,920
No, I'll pack and go with you.

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
Shancai.

44
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
You need to stay here alone.

45
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,280
Why do you think your dad and I
are working so hard?

46
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,480
We want you to do well at Mingde.

47
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
You can't let this get in your way.

48
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,360
What about Dong's Private Kitchen?

49
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,040
Are we going to give up?

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
More reason for you to hang in there.

51
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,200
I need your help
so I can create new dishes.

52
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,920
Did you forget?

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,840
This is our dream.

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Shancai, don't be scared.

55
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm here.

56
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
When are you coming back for me?

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,960
I don't want us to be separated.

58
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
We don't want to leave you behind either.

59
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
Once your uncle is well again, when we've saved some money,

60
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,560
we'll come back here.

61
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
That's right.

62
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
While we're away,

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,280
you need to be strong, okay?

64
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay.

65
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
For now,
you'll need to look after yourself.

66
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
Mom.

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,720
All right. We'll call you often.

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,920
We'll keep in touch through WeChat, okay?

69
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

70
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800
Xiaozi.

71
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
You've had the long face
since you came back from the hotel.

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
Your dad is worried about you.

73
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,400
You refused to tell us
what happened at the hotel.

74
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
The manager there said
the glass was shattered.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
The room was in a mess.

76
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,240
Did you fight with Daoming Si?

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,080
Do you want me to call him?

78
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,480
Go ahead and call him
if you want to embarrass me.

79
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,040
I heard from his mother.

80
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,040
You've been going out a lot
with a girl named Shancai.

81
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
Isn't that girl very cunning and tricky?

82
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
Did she cause trouble at the hotel?

83
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,720
Stop talking about it already.

84
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,640
-I'm just worried that she's using you.
-Mom.

85
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,560
Shancai is a good friend of mine.

86
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,520
I won't let anyone talk bad about her.

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,880
Even if you talked bad about her,

88
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,000
I wouldn't forgive you either.

89
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay.

90
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,000
All good.

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,880
Now, I can sleep.

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,920
Today is the first day of living alone.

93
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
I wonder if Mom and Dad
have arrived at the village.

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,480
What on earth?

95
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,640
Who is it?

96
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,760
Shancai.

97
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,720
The voice sounds familiar.

98
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,679
Could it be...

99
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,520
Xiaozi?

100
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
Hi.

101
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,840
Your neighborhood is so dark.

102
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
I tripped a few times coming here.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,000
The street light is broken.

104
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,960
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

105
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,320
I came here today because I wanted to...

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,600
-I want to say--
-Sorry.

107
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,640
I don't want to hear it.

108
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,000
Xiaozi.

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
My parents went back to the village.

110
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
From today onward,

111
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,920
I will be living here alone.

112
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,560
I was wondering why I didn't see them.

113
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm going to be very busy from now on.

114
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,520
I don't have time
to think about other things.

115
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,080
Next time you want to talk to me
about something,

116
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,520
I might not be able to give you any time.

117
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,040
Shancai.

118
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Do you hate me?

119
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,760
I...

120
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't get me wrong.

121
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Actually,

122
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,080
it's fine if you hate me.

123
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Because...

124
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,640
Because I lied to you.

125
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,920
That day, Si and I

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
didn't do anything.

127
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,880
He told me...

128
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
that he can't be with me.

129
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
What...

130
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,280
That's impossible.

131
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,000
At first, I was really confident.

132
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,920
I thought if I stood before him,
he wouldn't be able to say no.

133
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I didn't think

134
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
he would be so adamant.

135
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,480
He's heartless, isn't he?

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,680
I already told my mom

137
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,280
that I'm not going to see him again.

138
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Why?

139
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,600
I thought you two were doing
well together.

140
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
I get it now.

141
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,640
I shouldn't force someone
to be with a person they don't love.

142
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,200
But because I like Si,

143
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,720
I got to know you.

144
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
I'm glad.

145
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Shancai.

146
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,520
Will you still be my friend?

147
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course.

148
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
Listen.

149
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,360
I want you and Si to be happy together.

150
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't mind me.

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,760
Stop lying to yourself about how you feel.

152
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,280
I came today to tell you this.

153
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll go now.

154
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,800
Wait. Xiaozi.

155
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,560
Are you angry?

156
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,440
Do you know why I dumped Daoming Si?

157
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Why?

158
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,720
Because he said...

159
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,160
"My thoughts are filled with Shancai."

160
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,120
Tell the consul

161
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,680
that I'll be at the party.

162
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
Don't worry about it.

163
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,360
-Sure.
-Mom.

164
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,480
I need to go now. See you.

165
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,520
What is it?

166
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,280
Xiaozi and I are a no-go.

167
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,160
What are you talking about?

168
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,800
I already made myself clear.

169
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,280
I don't like her and I'll never marry her.

170
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,520
Go to the He family right now
and apologize to Xiaozi.

171
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
If you do that,
I'll agree to look past this matter.

172
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,160
I did nothing wrong.
Why should I apologize?

173
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I told you.

174
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,160
The one I like is Shancai.

175
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,400
I will not marry anyone other than her.

176
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,720
I told you very clearly too.

177
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,000
Dong Shancai will not set foot
inside our house.

178
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,120
Not even in her next life.

179
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
What's the point of a business marriage? If Xiaozi and I end up being miserable,

180
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,160
is that fair to her?

181
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,400
You're still young.
You have no idea what life is about.

182
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,600
Or I should say
you know nothing about love.

183
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,560
Yes.

184
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,040
I know nothing.

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
But who gave you the right
to control my life?

186
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,200
I gave birth to you.
So you should listen to me!

187
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
I will obey everything else.

188
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,880
But on this, I will not.

189
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,240
I rather not be your son.

190
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,360
I wish I was not Daoming Si!

191
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,720
Stop right there!

192
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,800
Cheers!

193
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
You're staying alone.

194
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,200
You should change to a safer lock.

195
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Thanks.

196
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,520
How's the safety here?

197
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,080
Is it safe to live alone?

198
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,680
It should be okay.

199
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,600
The street light looks broken.

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
The landlord has reported it.

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,480
It'll be fixed soon.

202
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,640
Where is Si? He should be here.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,320
-He's the only one missing.
-No.

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,400
Why?

205
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,400
Why what?

206
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,240
My house is too small.

207
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
There's no space.

208
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,440
The floor is already shaking
with the three of you.

209
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,120
Having one more person here
will probably cause an earthquake.

210
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
There are too many people.

211
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,840
Anyway,

212
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
I wonder what Si is up to.

213
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
He's been missing.

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,960
Si and Xiaozi are progressing well, right?

215
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,520
Hey, Shancai, how are they doing?

216
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,960
You should ask Daoming Si, not me.

217
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
It's probably Si.

218
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,520
Open the door.

219
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Hurry up.

220
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,880
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

221
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
Mrs. Daoming.

222
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
Why are you...

223
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,040
Shancai.

224
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,040
I thought we wouldn't see
each other again.

225
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,240
But there's something I want to ask you.

226
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,960
What exactly did you do

227
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,160
to split Xiaozi and Si apart?

228
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,640
How much longer

229
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
are you going to get in Si's way?

230
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,120
You can't just accuse me.

231
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,720
I didn't do anything.

232
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Simply accuse?

233
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,280
I know you won't admit it.

234
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,280
What I don't understand is

235
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,640
why such a nice girl

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,119
would do something so despicable.

237
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Ma'am.

238
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,599
Aren't you acting below your dignity here?

239
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,960
Sorry.

240
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,079
Are you talking to me?

241
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,160
Are you criticizing me?

242
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,800
Ma'am.

243
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,200
I think it's probably a misunderstanding
between Si and Xiaozi.

244
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,920
I know very well whether or not
it's a misunderstanding.

245
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,240
You can shut up.

246
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Shancai.

247
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,480
Let me make something clear.

248
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,680
You and Si belong to different worlds.

249
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,480
Your family background,

250
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,280
lifestyle and way of thinking
are completely different.

251
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,080
Imagine this.

252
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,440
If he takes you to a business forum,

253
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,520
will you feel inferior
because you can't participate

254
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,920
in the technical discussions?

255
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,800
If he takes you to a royal banquet,

256
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,360
are you going to be embarrassed

257
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,320
because you don't know
proper table manners?

258
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,160
Even if you marry into our household,

259
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,720
you won't get used
to this sort of lifestyle. I never wished for that kind of lifestyle.

260
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,800
I know where I stand.

261
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
I know I'm not suited

262
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
for those supposed high-society etiquette.

263
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Then why are you sticking to Si?

264
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
Obviously, you're a gold-digger.

265
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,720
I'm not the one sticking to your son.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,760
And I have no interest in your money.

267
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,760
Hypocrites are the worst kind of people.

268
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,120
How much do you want? No need to beat around the bush.

269
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,960
By the way, I heard your parents

270
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,600
went back to the village.

271
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
If you had known,

272
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,720
you should've accepted the money.
That would've solved the problem.

273
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,640
You brought these boys to your house
so they could defend you?

274
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,520
This must be one of your tactics too.

275
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,920
Don't think you could bully me
just because I'm young, you old hag!

276
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
What did you say? Say that again.

277
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,080
Old hag! Yes, I'm calling you that.

278
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,760
If you worry about your precious son,
you should put a collar on him

279
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,800
and latch it onto your waist
so you can bring him anywhere you go.

280
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Are you done?

281
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,680
Uneducated as expected,

282
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,120
talking to me like that.

283
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,360
I don't need you to decide
whether or not I'm educated.

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,640
Maybe for you,
I am just a weed in the garden.

285
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
But I never betrayed my conscience.

286
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
I've never done anything

287
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
that would stop me
from holding my head high.

288
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,200
Honestly, right now, I feel bad for you.

289
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,640
You are the worst person
I've ever met in this world.

290
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
In your eyes,

291
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
there are only you and your son.

292
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,720
You don't treat anyone else as humans.

293
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,000
You're not welcome in my world.

294
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,640
Get out.

295
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,160
I said leave!

296
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,440
Shancai, you're incredible.

297
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,280
Did you guys see
the expression on her face?

298
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
She looked like
she's about to burst a vein.

299
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,320
Shancai, you always call yourself a weed.

300
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
The explosive power of the weed
is awe-inspiring.

301
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,120
That's right.

302
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,000
Because I couldn't take it anymore.

303
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,960
So Si and Xiaozi broke up?

304
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I had a feeling they won't last very long.

305
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,280
But it ended really quickly.

306
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
Shancai.

307
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
What are you doing to do now?

308
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,040
Si's mom will not just let this go.

309
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,720
Lei is right.

310
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
You need to prepare yourself.

311
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,160
You can't keep running away.

312
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm not running away.

313
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
I won't admit defeat.

314
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
The more she tries to bully me,
the stronger I must be. I will unleash the spirit of the weed
and fight until the end.

315
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,480
How are you doing to do that?

316
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,800
She's the superwoman
of Asia's best hotel chain.

317
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
Not to forget,

318
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,320
the empress of Daoming Group.

319
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,000
So what?

320
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,840
She's still human. You're too naive.

321
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
She's powerful enough

322
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,320
that she could squash you
like squashing an ant.

323
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Squash?

324
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,960
With a blink of an eye,

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
you'd turn into dust.

326
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,480
Stop beating me down.

327
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,280
One moment you're supporting me,
the next you're scaring me.

328
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,040
We're not trying to scare you.

329
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,360
We're just outlining the situation
so we can find a solution.

330
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,840
Well...

331
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,160
How about this?

332
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,800
I'll think of a way to become
a woman she's happy with.

333
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,720
What kind of reaction is that?

334
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,120
What do you think about going out with Si?

335
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,280
I have no intention of doing that.

336
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,640
Good idea.

337
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
First, date Si and then tell his mom,

338
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,840
"I, Dong Shancai, am serious
in my relationship with Daoming Si.

339
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
Don't even think
about ruining our happiness."

340
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,160
Good idea.

341
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
What?

342
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,560
Next, you can give birth to a baby.
That's how you win.

343
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Don't you think Si's mom
will throw their kid off a bridge?

344
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,000
You guys are talking nonsense.

345
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,800
I never thought about
wanting to be with Daoming Si.

346
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,600
Hey.

347
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,920
Did I say something

348
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,040
really bad?

349
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,280
You said,

350
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
"I might be a weed.

351
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,280
But I won't let anyone belittle me. You're not welcome in my world.

352
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,560
Get out. I said, leave."

353
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,000
You said that.

354
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,440
Do you think I can take it back?

355
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,360
Can I pretend that I didn't say it?

356
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
Spoken words are like spilled water.

357
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
There's no turning back.

358
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,440
As long as Si likes you,

359
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
confrontations like these are inevitable

360
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,240
even if you didn't say that earlier.

361
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,200
No matter what,

362
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
we will support you. Yes, do your best.

363
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,560
Yes, we will support you.

364
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
All the best.

365
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Fighting with Daoming Si's mom? What did I get myself into?

366
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
What a witch Daoming Si's mom is.

367
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
He had to grow up in such harsh reality.

368
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,080
His world must be full of obstacles.

369
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
So why...

370
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,400
Why do I still want to be involved
with Daoming Si

371
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,160
and worsen the situation?

372
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Such a familiar sight.

373
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,400
When school first started,
Huaze Lei was here playing violin.

374
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
I really looked up to him.

375
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,720
And now,

376
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,000
he's become a great friend in my heart.

377
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't know why,

378
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,160
but when he's playing the violin,

379
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,840
it feels like nothing in this world

380
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,880
can't be solved.

381
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,240
There is no discord and no struggles.

382
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,960
I'm back.

383
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,520
Shancai, how was your day today?

384
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
I miss you so much.

385
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,400
In order to help your uncle,
Dad has been learning to fish.

386
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,720
Unfortunately, your dad gets seasick.

387
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,360
The first time he went out to sea today,
he vomited non-stop.

388
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,560
He wasn't much help at all
and had to be looked after.

389
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,960
So we didn't earn much
because of today's low catch.

390
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
I'm very sorry.

391
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't give you extra allowance.

392
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,360
Shancai,

393
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,720
you need to be more frugal
with your part-time earnings.

394
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,200
Things aren't going well,
but we are working hard.

395
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,320
Shancai, take good care of yourself.

396
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,520
We're not with you
so you must stay strong.

397
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,360
My dear daughter, we miss you a lot.

398
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,360
I heard you.

399
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,760
Take care of yourselves too.

400
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
I miss you and Dad too.

401
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,280
Don't worry about me.

402
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,760
Things will get better.

403
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,120
Who is it?

404
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,240
It's me, the landlord.

405
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,440
Thanks.

406
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
Mr. Wang, is something wrong?

407
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
Ms. Dong.

408
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,880
Sorry to say this.

409
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,120
I have to stop renting out this place.

410
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,280
Why?

411
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,160
Did something happen?

412
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,000
It's an emergency.

413
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,920
My daughter's mother-in-law

414
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,320
needs money for her operation.

415
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,280
I already have someone who is
interested in buying this house.

416
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,240
How about I return the rental fees
you previously paid?

417
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,120
On top of that,

418
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,880
I will give you an extra 500 yuan
as compensation. Is that okay?

419
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,280
But I'm...

420
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,440
I...

421
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,680
I know.

422
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,800
It's unfair to you.

423
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,560
But it's hard for me too.

424
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,960
I need this money urgently.

425
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,920
I have to pay the hospital bills.

426
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,880
I hope you can help us.

427
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,520
Maybe you can stay with your friends?

428
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,120
Please.

429
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,680
Thank you.

430
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,200
Mom.

431
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,480
Does the house...

432
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,440
Mom.

433
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,520
I wanted to ask

434
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
if the house at the village is okay?

435
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,640
I really miss you and Dad. I've got a bit of a problem here.

436
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,000
But I'll settle it soon.

437
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
NEW UPDATE FROM DONG SHANCAI

438
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,800
CHASED OUT FROM THE HOUSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

439
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,040
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!

440
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Did she really say that?

441
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,360
Did she really say she'll challenge my mom
because of me?

442
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,320
Too bad you weren't there.
It was jaw-dropping.

443
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,880
We wanted to tell you sooner,
but you've been missing.

444
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Right, I need to see her.

445
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
I want to hear it from her.

446
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,600
Wait.

447
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,400
A tough girl like Shancai
will never admit it.

448
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,680
So what? I'm going to see her now.

449
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,840
Hang tight.

450
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,280
We should talk.

451
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,440
About what? We can talk later.

452
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,440
Don't stop me.

453
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,120
Si, have you thought about
how to deal with your mom?

454
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,240
No. I'm not going to deal with her.

455
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,160
You know how my mom is.

456
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,280
Why ask?

457
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
So it's game over for Shancai.

458
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,840
Your mom can have her head any time.

459
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
I won't let that happen.

460
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,080
Where did you get your confidence?

461
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,560
Have you ever gone against her
at anything since childhood?

462
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
Yeah, talk is cheap.

463
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,520
We can forget the past.

464
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,320
But it concerns Shancai now.

465
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,280
All right.

466
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,320
She's my woman. I'll handle it.

467
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,360
Are you done questioning? I'm going then.

468
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,120
Si, I hope you're prepared. If your mom is serious, Shancai is dead.

469
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,640
She's in such a predicament
because of you.

470
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,920
Lei means

471
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,320
you should have a plan
before going to see Shancai.

472
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,679
Si, do you understand the situation?
Don't you need a plan?

473
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,040
A plan for what?

474
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,639
That stupid Shancai.

475
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,120
She never tells me any of her problems.

476
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,719
She's all alone now, without help
and getting bullied by my mom.

477
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,320
I won't let her go through this alone.

478
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,159
I'm going to her right now.

479
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,679
Hey.

480
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,880
He's acting like
he's the only gentleman here.

481
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,719
I can understand.

482
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,880
If I were a girl,

483
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,719
I'd be touched by his action.

484
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,719
He'd be perfect if he wasn't so stubborn.

485
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,560
Shancai, what happened? Are you okay?

486
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,560
Shancai, want to come to my place?
I'll wait for you.

487
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,720
Shancai, where are you? I'll come get you.

488
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,520
Just yesterday I challenged the old hag,

489
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,680
saying I'll fight her.

490
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,040
But now,
I don't even have a place to stay.

491
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,040
What should I do?

492
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
How will I survive?

493
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
Why can't you just stay by my side?

494
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,160
I'm very happy.

495
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,680
Because you said no matter what,
you won't let my mom come in between us.

496
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,080
From now on,
I will do my best to protect you.

497
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,000
Wait a minute.

498
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,600
First, let me go.

499
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,920
-You're holding me--
-No.

500
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,840
You're finally in my arms.

501
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I'll never let go.

502
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,440
Who knows where you'll run to?

503
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,000
Who said I'm running?

504
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,040
What is all this, then?

505
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,520
I packed up because I got chased out.

506
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,040
Why didn't you tell me?

507
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
I was about to tell you.

508
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,120
Can you not leave me?

509
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,680
Daoming Si.

510
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,480
I can't stay here.

511
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,440
Why not?

512
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,920
I'm telling you to stay here.

513
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,840
I can go to Qinghe's house

514
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,840
or Xiaoyou's.

515
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,440
I don't want to stay here.

516
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,240
Stop it.

517
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,280
Qinghe? Xiaoyou?

518
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,240
They're not your boyfriend.

519
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,160
Daoming Si.

520
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,200
Can't you think about me for once?

521
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,240
Think about what?

522
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
-I have plenty of rooms here.
-That's not the point!

523
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,240
The point is,

524
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,000
I just confronted your mom.

525
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,320
I can't stay here.

526
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
-It's ridiculous.
-Perfect timing.

527
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,240
You wanted to challenge her, right?

528
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,400
This is our chance

529
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,040
to tell her properly.

530
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,440
I am back with Shancai!

531
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,240
-Come and get me!
-Hey.

532
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,400
What a ruckus.

533
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,040
Where are your manners?

534
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,680
There are rules

535
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,560
in this household, no?

536
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,000
Ms. Yu.

537
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,160
You're still alive?

538
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,600
Mr. Daoming Si.

539
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,080
Still a joker as always.

540
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,280
Like you said,

541
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm still alive and kicking.

542
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
Stop it, Ms. Yu.

543
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No need to be so formal.

544
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,520
Just call me Si.

545
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,200
Saying my full name with honorifics

546
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,880
is a little over-the-top.

547
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,640
I'll skip the honorifics then.

548
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Si.

549
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,000
It's been a while.

550
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,240
You are still

551
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
such a troublemaker.

552
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,440
What's going on?

553
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,320
Who is this grandma?

554
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,800
Your mother is away in London.

555
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Before she left,

556
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,120
she asked me to come back
and hold the fort.

557
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Without her here,

558
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,040
someone needs to run the household.

559
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
So,

560
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,800
everything is in my scope.

561
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,320
Okay.

562
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
I'll tell you right now.

563
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,280
This is my friend, Shancai.

564
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
From today onward,

565
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,360
she will be living here.

566
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,000
So you're Shancai?

567
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,400
Hello.

568
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,560
I'm Dong Shancai.

569
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,280
This grandma looks ancient,

570
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
but she's got a strong aura.

571
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,640
Since Si

572
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,880
is adamant about staying with you,

573
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
I won't make things hard for you.

574
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Good decision.

575
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,520
I'll get Shancai to help
with the chores in the house.

576
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Ms. Yu!

577
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,440
Ms. Yu, have you got dementia?

578
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,600
Shancai isn't here to work.

579
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,960
I remember.

580
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,920
Even your dad didn't dare
talk to me like that.

581
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,800
Young people nowadays

582
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,880
seem to take things for granted.

583
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,920
They really believe

584
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
-that there are free lunches.
-You old piece of...

585
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
She's...

586
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,360
We're friends.

587
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,280
What's wrong
with her staying here for free?

588
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,320
I know.

589
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,440
Society has changed.

590
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,800
Young people always want it easy.

591
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,560
But I am

592
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,160
an old, traditional person.

593
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,280
I believe having
the right attitude is important.

594
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,520
Why can't Ms. Shancai work in exchange

595
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,840
for room and board?

596
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,320
Of course I can.

597
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,680
Ma'am, you shouldn't look down on others.

598
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
I wouldn't want to stay here

599
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
for free anyway.

600
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,600
Do you know how to clean?

601
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,440
Are you a hard worker?

602
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,960
Of course.

603
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,480
I helped my mom with chores
since I was young.

604
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,600
-I know how to cook too.
-That's enough!

605
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't agree.

606
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,640
I didn't ask you to stay
to become a servant.

607
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,120
I'm the man.

608
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,240
I should look after you.

609
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,760
I think your grandma makes a lot of sense.

610
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,640
I have no money

611
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,240
and nowhere to go.

612
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,000
So I need a proper reason to stay.

613
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,800
-That way, I can protect my pride.
-No.

614
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,520
There's no way I can let you

615
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,880
be a cleaner here.

616
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,560
-But--
-Enough with that.

617
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
I will never agree.

618
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,680
Fine. I'll go then.

619
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
What era are we living in?

620
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,040
There's nothing wrong
with friends staying over.

621
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,880
Ximen and Meizuo come here all the time.

622
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
This isn't about right or wrong.

623
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,760
It's about willingness.

624
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,640
I don't want her to belittle me.

625
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,440
Shancai.

626
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,120
Are you sure you want to be a worker here?

627
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,960
-Yes.
-You...

628
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,240
You piss me off.

629
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,960
Don't expect me to be lenient with you

630
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,400
just because you're Si's friend.

631
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,800
You'd better be prepared.

632
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,160
You hear me?

633
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,720
Yes.

634
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,000
I can't hear you.

635
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,440
Yes.

636
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,120
Are you a mosquito?

637
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,280
Yes! Good.
