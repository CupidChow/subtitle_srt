A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 48

3
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,320
I know you did it so Daoming Si
and I can be together.

4
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Stay and wait with me

5
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
until he wakes up.

6
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,120
We'll wait for him to wake up.

7
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,320
With you around,
I'll feel brave and more confident.

8
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,800
It's been raining for days.

9
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Is God trying to help Si and Shancai,
or keep them from being together?

10
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Xiaozi?

11
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Meizuo, I've made my decision.

12
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,080
No matter what,

13
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm on Shancai's side.

14
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,360
Okay.

15
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
Let's meet at Si's house in a bit.

16
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,720
Okay.

17
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,920
Shancai, stay strong.

18
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
You have to make it to the end.

19
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
You're the luckiest girl

20
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
because you have Daoming Si

21
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
who loves you with all his life.

22
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,400
Shancai's been standing there for days.

23
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,280
Your son is about to starve to death. When are you going to give in?

24
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
They're being very naive.

25
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,520
They think that by doing this,

26
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
they can force me to give in.

27
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm telling you,

28
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
that's not going to happen.

29
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
Mom, can you wake up?

30
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Don't tell me to wake up.

31
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,120
I know precisely what I'm doing.

32
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm begging you.

33
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
Someone is going to die.

34
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,320
Have you ever thought
about what caused this situation?

35
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,440
It's because they were disobedient.

36
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
This is the price they have to pay.

37
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,480
This is the result.

38
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Do you think

39
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,160
they're the only ones who are dying?

40
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,480
Let me tell you something.

41
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm dying too.

42
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,200
I'm dying of anger
because my children are disobedient.

43
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
Xiaozi?

44
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,960
I've talked to my parents.

45
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll never, ever marry Daoming Si.

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Because

47
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,200
I really want Shancai to be with Si.

48
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
Mrs. Daoming,

49
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,080
give up already.

50
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Is this your decision?

51
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
It's my decision.

52
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
And it's my dad's decision too.

53
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,000
My dad will talk to you soon.

54
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,920
Mrs. Daoming,
apart from being here with Xiaozi,

55
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
we have something very important

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
you and Zhuang should look at.

57
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,240
Shancai, it's over now.

58
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,960
Shancai, Mrs. Daoming gave in.

59
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,400
She won't try to separate
you and Si anymore.

60
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
Daoming Si.

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm here.

62
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,440
Wait for me.

63
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Why are my feet so heavy?

64
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,440
You're so close to me now.

65
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,000
Why can't I walk over to you?

66
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm fine.

67
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,800
I can do this.

68
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,560
If I can't walk to you, where else would I go?

69
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,520
What is the principle of Schumpeter theory
of creative destruction?

70
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,560
In an entrepreneurial life cycle,
one doesn't always remain an entrepreneur.

71
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Unless he continues to evolve

72
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
and create new formations,

73
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,400
which means to destroy the old,
creating the new.

74
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,320
Because with every depression,

75
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,880
there's a possibility to gain new skills.

76
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,160
It becomes a new product, skill,

77
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,800
or business model

78
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,800
to bring the most benefit.

79
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,360
That day, I was studying with Shancai.

80
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,520
She asked me about
a theory I had memorized.

81
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I gave her the answer fluently,

82
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,640
but I suddenly felt that

83
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,040
remembering the theory
and understanding it

84
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,680
were two totally different things.

85
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
And Shancai's expression at that moment...

86
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,360
You're incredible.

87
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,880
She was so cute that day.

88
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,120
I had never seen
that expression on her face before.

89
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
It was true admiration.

90
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
I hope that
I will always be the person she admires.

91
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,520
So, when I do my job in the future,

92
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,200
I'll have more than memorized theories

93
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,040
or an affluent family background.

94
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,080
I want to become a talented person.

95
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
I want to find out

96
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
how we can truly realize
the creative destruction theory.

97
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,240
I started looking for ways

98
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,920
to think out of the box
and create something new.

99
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,080
So I decided to launch
a startup incubator platform project.

100
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
In this project,

101
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,920
I've collected ideas and creative thoughts

102
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,680
from different fields,
places, and products.

103
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,520
This might allow us
to break free of our old ways.

104
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,320
Also, this project is able
to bring about market miracles.

105
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,560
It includes artificial intelligence
technology development

106
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,320
and business strategies
that are applicable to every field.

107
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Practical products that everyone uses
in their daily life will also be included.

108
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,120
Something as small as a sauce packet
can become an international product.

109
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,040
I've done preliminary research
on all these aspects.

110
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Currently, nobody knows about my research.

111
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
But I'll announce it soon

112
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,760
because we need the help of many people.

113
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,079
Hey, what is Si's email password?

114
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,079
F4's friendship anniversary.

115
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
LOG IN

116
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,359
It's not it.

117
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,480
It must be Shancai's birthday.

118
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,720
That would be too easy.

119
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,960
LOG IN

120
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,080
I guess Si is a simple person.

121
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,040
EMBRACE YOUR DREAMS

122
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
Of course, I didn't have enough time,

123
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,400
so I haven't contacted anyone yet.

124
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,080
But I truly believe that
this project is feasible.

125
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm very confident.

126
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
Also,

127
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,440
I have some very talented friends.

128
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm sure when they find out
about this project,

129
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,760
they'll do their best to help me out.

130
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,320
Don't you think this tea is special?

131
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes, it's very fragrant.

132
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,440
It's a new kind
that has never been on the market.

133
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,880
Are you willing to incorporate it

134
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
-into your pastries?
-Yes.

135
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
DONG'S KING OF SQUID

136
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,520
From the first day I met them,

137
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,040
they've always been kind
and sincere to me.

138
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,160
My worries, my immaturity,

139
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,800
my emotions...

140
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,480
They accepted me for who I am.

141
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm very happy because my project

142
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
can bring hope to people.

143
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,160
Do you really think that

144
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,360
Shancai's Eight Treasure Spicy Sauce
can be sold across China?

145
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,760
Here, nothing is impossible.

146
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,560
My name is Daoming Si.

147
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,520
My family owns an international
enterprise, Daoming Group.

148
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
Even though I don't know
whether our group can always be on top,

149
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
I hope that when I join the group,

150
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,480
I can instill new energy
into the business empire my dad built.

151
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
So that my mom

152
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,960
and my sister can be proud of me.

153
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,880
We're not throwing away our past. We're using new methods

154
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,400
to bring glory to our past.

155
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
The boy that has always got
on their nerves

156
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,440
is all grown up now.

157
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,040
Because he met a girl, Dong Shancai.

158
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,600
This girl taught him a lot.

159
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,440
He realized that the world
doesn't revolve around him.

160
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,760
He learned how to let go of his pride
and accomplish things.

161
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,480
Because her love gave him strength.

162
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,480
I want to remember that moment.

163
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,640
And I want to remind myself
to remember that moment.

164
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,640
Therefore, I'm going to name
this project Embrace Your Dreams.

165
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
We all have dreams

166
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,120
and we should all bravely
embrace our dreams.

167
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,920
Mom.

168
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,880
Lei, I can see your face.

169
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
You probably think this is so sentimental.

170
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
That's exactly what I want.

171
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,720
Why are you here?

172
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
After watching Si's project,
you passed out.

173
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,040
The doctor said you were too tired.

174
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
We thought you passed out
because you were so mad at him.

175
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
But I think you saw

176
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,640
how grown-up and mature he is now.

177
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,520
So you're finally able to let go and rest.

178
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,840
How long did I sleep for?

179
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Seven days.

180
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,400
I tried to wake you up.

181
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,600
You would open your eyes and say,

182
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,840
"The sun isn't out yet."

183
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,680
Just like a child.

184
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
I was too exhausted.

185
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,160
I know.

186
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
You should rest.

187
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,440
SAFE AND HEALTHY, FRIED KING OF SQUID

188
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,240
UNLIMITED CREATIVITY, SPICY KING OF SQUID

189
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,240
MARKETING POSITION OF KING OF SQUID

190
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,040
EMBRACE YOUR DREAMS

191
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Daoming Group had faced
some financial troubles

192
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,080
because of over-expansion
and management issues,

193
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,320
but now there is hope.

194
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Daoming Feng's only son, Daoming Si,

195
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,640
has launched an incubator platform
for young people to embrace their dreams.

196
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,280
It has won the support
of many domestic financial companies.

197
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,360
They have joined the strategic alliance

198
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,600
and some even plan to invest.

199
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,960
The Shenzhen Tencent Technology Platform

200
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,640
has provided a building
for all the entrepreneurs,

201
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,920
which will become the future
dream incubator headquarters.

202
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,280
It's closed today?

203
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
How is that possible? Hello, Ximen?

204
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,720
I'm here.

205
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,920
Yeah, it's weird.

206
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,280
It says that it's closed today.

207
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Where are you?

208
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,520
What are you talking about?

209
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,600
Aren't we sending off Lei today?

210
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
That was yesterday.

211
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,720
We already sent him off.

212
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,560
You didn't show up.
And you weren't answering your phone.

213
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,840
Yesterday?

214
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,880
I didn't show up?

215
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,760
What's going on?

216
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,800
-Where's Si?
-Si went to London with Lei.

217
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,560
To London?

218
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,760
How is that possible?

219
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Why would he ditch me
and go to London himself?

220
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,320
Shancai, did you forget everything?

221
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,760
What's going on?

222
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,200
You and Si broke up.

223
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,560
Broke up?

224
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,080
That's impossible.

225
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,960
Si was held captive
by his mom and stopped eating.

226
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,240
I stood outside his house
and didn't eat too.

227
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Everything was taken care of.

228
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,560
We got back together.

229
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,160
That never happened.

231
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,040
You rejected Si.

232
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,920
So he married Xiaozi.

233
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,320
His mom took him to London today.

234
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,200
That can't be.

235
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,400
That can't be.

236
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,600
Where is Si? I need to go see him.

237
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
He's probably at the airport.

238
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,640
I have to go there.

239
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,080
Daoming Si.

240
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Where is this?

241
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,040
London. London?

242
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
Why are you in London?

243
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,080
No.

244
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,280
This is a dream. You know what?

245
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,320
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

246
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,000
Wait.

247
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,800
I remember that.

248
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,680
I do.

249
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
You know what?

250
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,320
If you listen to me,
I'll let you be my girlfriend.

251
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,520
Gosh, it is a dream.

252
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
This dream brought me back
to the arrogant and annoying Si.

253
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,560
No. Wake up!

254
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,920
Wake up!

255
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,720
Shancai.

256
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Listen to me.

257
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,760
No matter where I go, you can be
with me within a one-meter radius.

258
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,240
When I eat, you can sit with me.

259
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,480
Even better,

260
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,000
you can find me anytime you want

261
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,520
and be with me immediately.

262
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,920
Of course,

263
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,520
I can take you to and from school
once a week.

264
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,280
I can give you good snacks at school.

265
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,160
I can help you with homework
if you need it.

266
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,120
We can go to the best restaurant
in Shanghai on your birthday.

267
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,000
When we play games, I'll let you beat me.

268
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,800
You can also enjoy the meteor garden
I designed for you.

269
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Also,

270
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
I can get you a new phone
to replace the broken one. The content is different,

271
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
but why does it still make me mad?

272
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,120
What?

273
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,000
You must feel really happy now.

274
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,840
You must be kidding me!

275
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,680
Who do you think I am?

276
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,760
Hey!

277
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,080
Hey! What are you doing?

278
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,360
Daoming Si.

279
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,200
I'm not sure if you're crazy
or if you're dumb.

280
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,320
I don't know
why you said all of that to me.

281
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,040
I don't need your charity
or some special treatment.

282
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,080
I also don't need your money
or a new phone.

283
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,480
I want to go home!

284
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
Hey, listen to me.

285
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,360
You'd better not come back crying.

286
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,520
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

287
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,320
Who do you think you are?

288
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,400
I don't give a damn.

289
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,520
Well?

290
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,160
You can't have me even
if you give me everything in the world.

291
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,600
Listen.

292
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,280
I, Dong Shancai, simply won't
date a narcissist like you.

293
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
What you just said is as stupid
as your pineapple head.

294
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,400
Goodbye!

295
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Fine.

296
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,360
I guess you don't like those things.

297
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,400
Listen to me.

298
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,080
There's nothing in this world
that I can't have.

299
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
You're a handful.

300
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,880
You'll be a difficult wife.

301
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,240
I'm leaving.

302
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,160
Don't regret this.

303
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,320
Daoming Si, don't go!

304
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,520
Don't go!

305
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,280
Daoming Si! Stop! Don't go!

306
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,400
If apologies worked,
why would we need the police?

307
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,600
Come back here!

308
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,520
She didn't mean to do it.
She apologized to you, didn't she?

309
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,280
Why do you have to be so mean?

310
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,760
You've got guts.

311
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,000
Daoming Si!

312
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
Hey!

313
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,480
You're a bad girl.

314
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,240
Why are you so mean?

315
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,400
It's all your fault!

316
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,600
Si...

317
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,400
Stop crying.

318
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,600
I won't hurt you anymore.

319
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,520
Sorry, I'm late.

320
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,000
If you say you didn't do it,
I believe you.

321
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
If you dare kick her,

322
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,200
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

323
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,120
Stupid boy.

324
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
Why did you come here?

325
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,400
Don't look at me with your filthy face.

326
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,320
Close your eyes.

327
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,560
Idiot.

328
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,880
Didn't I tell you before?

329
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,360
Even if you went to Mars,
I'd still go after you.

330
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,600
You wouldn't be able
to get rid of me in this life.

331
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,280
Stop struggling for no reason.

332
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
Shancai.

333
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,800
I just want to be with you.

334
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,040
I, Dong Shancai,
will be with you no matter what.

335
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,320
Can you not leave me?

336
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,760
To the end of the world,

337
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,080
to hell or heaven,

338
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,040
I'll be with him.

339
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,160
Daoming Si! I'm very happy.

340
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,160
Because you're the only one I'm willing
to trade all the meteors in the sky for.

341
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,280
Shancai.

342
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,520
Do you know what the lyrics mean?

343
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,160
I do.

344
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,120
Do you love Daoming Si?

345
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,560
I do.

346
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,880
Do you want me to bring him out?

347
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,320
Yes, please, Zhuang.

348
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
I ask of the world, what is love?

349
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,080
People live and die for it.

350
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,800
I ask of the world, what is love?

351
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,800
People live and die for it.

352
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,840
I ask of the world, what is love?

353
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,040
People live and die for it!

354
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,600
Why isn't the spell working?

355
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
Shancai, you're not devoted enough.

356
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,040
All right.

357
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,840
If we can only conjure F3,

358
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,440
just pick one of them
to be your husband then.

359
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,560
What?
