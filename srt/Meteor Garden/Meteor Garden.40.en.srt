A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
EPISODE 40

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
Thomas.

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
Are you sure this is Daoming Si's house?

5
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Yes.

6
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,640
I'll go in with you.

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,720
No.

8
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,880
I'll go in myself.

9
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,080
Okay.

10
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,680
Good luck.

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
I'll wait out here.

12
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
I feel strangely calm at this moment

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
when I should be nervous instead.

14
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,600
I finally realized that
during this whole time,

15
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
I, Dong Shancai, was never alone.

16
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm so close to him now.

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,360
I might see him at any time now.

18
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,400
Mrs. Yu?

19
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
Shancai.

20
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
You're here.

21
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Mrs. Yu,

22
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
I missed you so much.

23
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
You look pale.

24
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
You've lost weight.

25
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Was it a bad trip?

26
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,200
I guess it's obvious.

27
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,240
I almost had to sleep
on the street in London.

28
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,440
How did you know I was coming?

29
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,360
Haven't I been here waiting for you?

30
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,440
Where's Daoming Si?

31
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
He's inside.

32
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
Can I go see him?

33
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
Come with me.

34
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
My dear,

35
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,120
promise me one thing.

36
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,400
No matter what happens,

37
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
you must be strong.

38
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,880
Have you forgotten?

39
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
I'm like a weed.

40
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Daoming Si.

41
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,080
Why are you here?

42
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm here to see you.

43
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
Who told you to come here?

44
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Go home.

45
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm staying in London.

46
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,560
Daoming Si, what's wrong with you?

47
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
You're joking, aren't you?

48
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,200
I know.

49
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,960
Your mom must have said or done
something to make you...

50
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,320
It has nothing to do with my mom.

51
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,400
This is my decision.

52
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
It was my decision
to leave Mingde University.

53
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,400
You should leave.

54
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,200
It was my own fault.

55
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,960
I shouldn't have approached you.

56
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,360
Let's just put everything behind us.

57
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Daoming Si, turn around.

58
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,880
Look into my eyes.

59
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,440
Say that to me again.

60
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
Don't come here again.

61
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,760
Tell me this isn't real.

62
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Please tell me it isn't real.

63
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,680
Shancai.

64
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm sorry.

65
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Something happened in my family.

66
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
I have to focus entirely

67
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,760
on helping Daoming Group
get through this rough patch.

68
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,600
I can't be selfish

69
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
and pretend like my family is fine.

70
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,720
But we agreed to face everything together.

71
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
We can all help you.

72
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,200
Our thoughts were
too simplistic and immature.

73
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
I thought I could do that.

74
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
But I'm sorry,

75
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,560
I can't.

76
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,400
I can't be selfish like you.

77
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Fine.

78
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
I understand.

79
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,280
Sorry for the trouble.

80
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
Are you happy now?

81
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Are you satisfied now?

82
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
You disgust me.

83
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,080
I came all the way here to see him,

84
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
but he feels so distant from me.

85
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
What if...

86
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,720
What if I never see him again after this?

87
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Hey. Are you crying?

88
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,920
Did you see Daoming Si?

89
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,880
I did.

90
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,960
He told me...

91
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,960
to never come see him again.

92
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
How could he say that?

93
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,080
Don't be sad.

94
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,560
Shancai, you'll meet
someone better than him.

95
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's go see the city.

96
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
Don't worry.

97
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,120
You'll be fine.

98
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
How much longer
do you want to stay in London?

99
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
Or are you heading back to Shanghai now?

100
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't know.

101
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,560
Huaze Lei.

102
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Is that your friend?

103
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,920
Yes. Okay.

104
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,640
I'll get going now.

105
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,160
-Call me, okay?
-Okay.

106
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Bye.

107
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,400
You weren't answering your phone.

108
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,880
I asked the hotel manager,
but you hadn't checked in yet.

109
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
I was worried about you.

110
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,240
Did you see Si?

111
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,880
Yes.

112
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,520
Are you okay? What's wrong?

113
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,320
I went to see him.

114
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,440
And he told me...

115
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,480
He didn't want to see me again.

116
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,599
I know he has his reasons, but...

117
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,200
I came all the way to see him.

118
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,599
But he wouldn't...

119
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,960
He wouldn't even come out.

120
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,400
He didn't want to see me

121
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,840
Mrs. Daoming,
you have a video conference with Mr. He.

122
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
All right. Set it here.

123
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,120
Hello, Mr. He.

124
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,080
Mrs. Daoming,

125
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,000
I've heard that Liu Business Group

126
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,640
will be acquiring Maple Hotel

127
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,120
and Daoming Group for 1.3 million yuan.

128
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,480
They've underestimated the value
of Maple Hotel and Daoming Group.

129
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,360
This fiscal report

130
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,320
will not influence my sincerity
in working with Daoming Group.

131
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,440
All you need to do is
release your shares to us.

132
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,320
After all,

133
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,480
you probably can't find
any investors better than us.

134
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,800
Mr. He, you're our group's
most important board member.

135
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,040
Of course I need your support.

136
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Mr. Daoming and I were good friends.

137
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm willing to support you
for that reason.

138
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,360
By the way, my wife wants to thank you

139
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,360
for the gift you gave Xiaozi.

140
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
Such a valuable gift.

141
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,240
There's no need to thank me.

142
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,440
Xiaozi is already like a daughter to me.

143
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,720
DAOMING GROUP TO BE ACQUIRED
BY LIU BUSINESS GROUP

144
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,040
Why did I have to come home?

145
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,600
Why does Shancai have to leave?

146
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
I know you don't like her.

147
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,640
But can't you give her a chance?

148
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,960
-I can't!
-Why?

149
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,120
Because we have no time.

150
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,200
No time? No time?

151
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Are you dying or am I dying?

152
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,360
It's Daoming Group.

153
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
Daoming Group has no time.
Do you know that?

154
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,760
If I can't gain the trust
of Xiaozi's dad...

155
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,640
If he kicks me off the board...

156
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,280
If he takes all the shares,

157
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,880
then everything your dad left behind...

158
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,480
Daoming Group will be gone!

159
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,200
Everything will be gone!
Do you understand?

160
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,840
So you had to sacrifice me and Shancai?

161
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
Yes.

162
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,120
I'm sacrificing you and Shancai

163
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,720
for the thousands of employees
in Daoming Group.

164
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
Idiot.

165
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,920
Why would I leave you?

166
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,040
I was just joking.

167
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
Let's go back to Shanghai together.

168
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,280
It was a dream.

169
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,400
The same dream.

170
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,120
You're awake?

171
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,720
You slept for 12 hours.

172
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,480
Are you sure you're not sick?

173
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,160
You prepared so much food.

174
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,160
Even instant noodles.

175
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,000
I brought that especially for you.

176
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,760
What? For me?

177
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
Don't disappear again.

178
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm sorry.

179
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,560
So much has happened.

180
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,440
I still can't...

181
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
Lei.

182
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,920
Thank you for everything.

183
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,720
I'm very happy.

184
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,200
You said that a lot of times.

185
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,880
Really?

186
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,120
I'm very grateful to you.

187
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,720
Everything that happened in London

188
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,880
feels so strange to me.

189
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
I think it's Si
who made you feel that way.

190
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,800
I heard that Daoming Group

191
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,880
is facing some trouble now.

192
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,680
Other business groups are trying
to acquire their shares.

193
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm sure that Si is acting weird
because of that.

194
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,240
I don't know.

195
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm exhausted.

196
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,680
Why can't we just be together
like a normal couple?

197
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,480
Why can't he stop me from leaving?

198
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm sorry.

199
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,160
I shouldn't have complained to you.

200
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,240
You can say anything you want to me.

201
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,600
Why are you in London?

202
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,800
In Shanghai, I was talking
to Ximen and Meizuo.

203
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,200
They said you must be wandering
around in London.

204
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,200
After that, I couldn't
stop worrying about you.

205
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,360
So I decided to come to London
just to make sure.

206
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,040
Since we're here,

207
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,760
let's go sightseeing.

208
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
You'll feel better.

209
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,800
Si.

210
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
You have to be strong.

211
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,880
You're the only successor
of Daoming Group.

212
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,640
How can you be so weak?

213
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,720
Yes.

214
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
I'm Daoming Si.

215
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,920
What a terrible person to be.

216
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
If only I weren't Daoming Si.

217
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,360
Mrs. Yu.

218
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Shancai...

219
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,520
I kicked her out.

220
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
She came all the way
from Shanghai to London

221
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,760
just to see me.

222
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,920
But I pushed her away.

223
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
She must be devastated.

224
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,880
She probably doesn't understand why.

225
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,960
She must...

226
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,560
Goodness.

227
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,160
Shancai is fine.

228
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,560
She'll be fine.

229
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,880
I miss her so much.

230
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
-What?
-What?

231
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,120
-London?
-London?

232
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,680
Yes.

233
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,320
Shancai is in London.

234
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
Why?

235
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Si's mom forced him to go to London.

236
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,160
What does that have to do with Shancai?

237
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,920
What do you think?

238
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,320
Three words.

239
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,160
Because of love.

240
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
"Because of love"?

241
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,200
So Shancai isn't coming back?

242
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,920
Goodness.

243
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,480
My world has turned dark again.

244
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,400
No wonder I haven't seen her for days.

245
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,440
So Daoming Si isn't coming back
to Shanghai?

246
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,480
Nobody knows anything about him.

247
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,120
But that's weird.

248
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
Shancai went to London,

249
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,920
but she hasn't been on her phone.

250
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,080
She hasn't replied to any messages.

251
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,320
What if something happened to her? Shut your mouth.

252
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,600
LEI SENT YOU A MESSAGE

253
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,120
All right, no need to worry now.

254
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Lei is in London.

255
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
Shancai went to London to see Si.

256
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,720
Now Lei is in London too?

257
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,680
Why is everyone in London?

258
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,600
I don't understand.

259
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,960
Just stop worrying.

260
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,560
Shancai will be fine.

261
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,600
Shancai, are you really
in London to see Si?

262
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
Is he bullying you again?

263
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,640
Tell me, I'll beat him up for you.

264
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,880
Shancai, where are you?

265
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,160
Please reply. Zhen and I are worried sick.

266
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,000
Qinghe.

267
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,920
Everything is fine here in London.

268
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Don't worry about me.

269
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,040
Hello, is Ximen in there?

270
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,560
Yes. This way, please.

271
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,280
Are you here to find out about Shancai?

272
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,160
Is something wrong with Shancai and Si?

273
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
What do you mean?

274
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,320
I just think something is wrong.

275
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Shancai didn't mention it,
so I didn't ask her anything.

276
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,760
I don't know any more than you.

277
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,840
I'm worried that

278
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,400
nobody's taking care of Shancai in London.

279
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Don't worry. She's not alone.

280
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,000
-So Daoming Si--
-Lei went to London.

281
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,960
With him there,

282
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Shancai will be fine.

283
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,360
Every time I see you, you look different.

284
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,080
Really different.

285
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
Really?

286
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,520
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

287
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,400
It is a compliment.

288
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,080
By the way,

289
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
I never had a chance to thank you.

290
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,680
So, thank you so much.

291
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,679
Thank you for everything you've done.

292
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,920
So, how many buildings did you go to?

293
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
More than you can imagine.

294
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,280
Your hair...

295
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,440
Is it too short?

296
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,159
No.

297
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,560
This haircut is cute.

298
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,560
You look adorable.

299
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,480
It took me a lot of courage to cut it.

300
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,560
I see it as a new start.

301
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,280
Hey.

302
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,040
There's an ice cream truck.

303
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,320
Do you want some?

304
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,600
Yes.

305
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,920
Before I go, I want to go see Thomas

306
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
and thank him.

307
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
He helped me out a lot.

308
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,320
I'll go with you.

309
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,640
Why?

310
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,160
I'm worried you'll get lost
before you find him.

311
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,360
How is that possible?

312
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,040
He took good care of you.

313
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,320
I want to thank him too.

314
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,040
How about we ask him out to dinner?

315
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
Okay.

316
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,840
Hey.

317
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,480
They're eating so much.

318
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,160
You picked an expensive restaurant.

319
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,240
I don't have that much money.

320
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,680
It's fine. I'll take care of it.

321
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,360
Lei.

322
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,280
Thank you for treating us to dinner.

323
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,240
You're welcome.

324
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,760
Did you come from Shanghai
just to find Shancai?

325
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,560
Yes.

326
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,920
Do you like Shancai?

327
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
I do.

328
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,120
I like her too.

329
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
When I met Shancai,

330
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,960
she told me that she liked me.

331
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,400
Hey.

332
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,200
No, I didn't.

333
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,880
I mistook you for someone else.

334
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,440
I thought the guy at the piano was...

335
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Who did you think it was?

336
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
Was it Lei?

337
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,120
If Daoming Si doesn't like Shancai,

338
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,640
will Shancai date Lei?

339
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,440
Will you? -Will you?
-Will you?

340
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,400
Cut it out.
Or else I won't pay for your meals.

00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,000
To Shancai's happiness.

342
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,720
-To Shancai's happiness.
-To Shancai's happiness.

343
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,520
Thank you.

344
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,280
Thanks.

345
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,480
Lei.

346
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,840
Hey, how much is it? I'll pay you once I get back.

347
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,960
It's fine. My wallet is gone.

348
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,920
This is all I have.

349
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,240
Thomas, put that away.

350
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,720
What should we do now?

351
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,160
When you feel like crying, do a handstand,

352
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,400
then your tears won't fall down.
