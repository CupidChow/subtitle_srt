1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,916
Huh? Are those two fighting?

2
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,875
P-Please excuse me!

3
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,875
You're all supposed to get along here!

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,250
What's that? You're just playing?

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,333
Aw, I was fooled
by those scary faces of yours!

6
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,875
Furret?

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,125
You're at this chase again?

8
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,541
You know it's wrong.
You two should be friends.

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,791
Just wait a sec! Be good, okay?

10
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:48,791
Hold on!

11
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,833
Furret! Rattata!

12
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,791
What if I do this?

13
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:07,708
Or maybe over here?!

14
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,791
What is she doing?

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,750
Tryin' to get a signal on her cell phone.

16
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,625
She wants to look up
some things about Pokémon, she said.

17
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,250
The reception here is real bad.

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,208
It's more like
cell phones are totally useless.

19
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,375
I did things like that
when I first got here, too.

20
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,958
I gave it up by day three.

21
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,208
Poor Haru. I totally get it.

22
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,750
No luck here either, huh?

23
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,541
I was told that my job is
to show the Pokémon a good time,

24
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,291
but I have no idea
what I'm supposed to do.

25
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:45,375
I want you to make the Pokémon feel
the same way that you do.

26
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:50,375
Ms. Watanabe has
such a sweet face for someone

27
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,458
who's asking me to do an impossible thing.

28
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,625
What will I do…?

29
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,666
What's with the doomed look?

30
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,500
Well, it's not really anything important…

31
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,541
And may I say,
you're great at art, Ms. Alisa.

32
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,041
Anybody can do art.

33
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,708
But stop with
the "May I, Ms." stuff, please?

34
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,125
But you've been here longer.

35
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,500
That doesn't matter.

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,708
Here. Take it.

37
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,041
You want me to…?

38
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,333
So? You're still stuck wondering
what you're supposed to be doing.

39
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,041
I want to make sure
the Pokémon have a good time here,

40
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,875
but nothing I try seems to work out.

41
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,041
You know, all you can do is find out
what makes them happy and make it happen.

42
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,041
Yeah, but the Pokémon don't
exactly tell you what makes them happy.

43
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,000
Most humans won't say it
to your face, either.

44
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,291
They say things like, "Take a guess."

45
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,291
That's true.

46
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,791
Is that a Psyduck?
You like that Pokémon? Awesome!

47
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,125
No… Well, yeah…

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,708
It's really supposed to be a Pikachu.

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,166
Still, it's only fun
if you find out yourself.

50
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,708
You really went for it, huh?

51
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,916
I guess you don't really get the chance
to fly free in the big city, do you?

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,875
You were just letting off steam.

53
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't worry about those doodles of ours.

54
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:59,500
The important thing is to play
where there's lots of space.

55
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,166
That way, nobody can get hurt!

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,375
See? Pokémon are
pretty unpredictable, y'know?

57
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,333
Yeah.

58
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,000
Ouch.

59
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:17,916
All right.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,541
So, if you could give me any advice or…

61
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,625
The early days are always hard.
So you should just do what you can, right?

62
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:31,000
Is there anything specific
that you think I should be doing?

63
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,041
Hey, don't ask me!

64
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,125
Ouch!

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,541
Tyler, what's with that one?

66
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,541
You mean Psyduck?

67
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:50,416
Ms. Watanabe has been taking care of them.
They've been here for about two weeks.

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,958
But they're terribly shy, so they haven't
really made any connections.

69
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,833
I don't think they're having fun.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,875
Right then! Psyduck, I choose you!

71
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,583
Hey! Psyduck!

72
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,625
Psyduck?

73
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,291
Psyduck!

74
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,083
Psyduck!

75
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,875
Come on, Psyduck!

76
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,208
Bring it on…

77
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:46,083
Psyduck is "constantly wracked
by a headache."

78
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,708
The poor thing.

79
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:53,541
"When the headache turns intense,
they begin using mysterious powers."

80
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,750
"The way to control
their psychic powers is…"

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,833
Huh?

82
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
What's going on?

83
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,208
Paranormal activity?!

84
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,458
Psyduck…
Their psychic powers are out of control!

85
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,500
Hey! Where'd you go?

86
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,500
You're not in trouble, so please come out.

87
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,916
There!

88
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,041
T-Tyler, look out!

89
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,625
Oh no!

90
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,083
Are you okay?

91
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,083
I-I'm sorry!

92
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,625
What are you in such a hurry for?

93
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,125
I was chasing Psyduck
when a Diglett popped up,

94
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,458
so I swerved, but my scooter wouldn't stop
and I went flying--

95
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,958
Come on, everything's fine now.

96
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,125
Yeah, but was that…

97
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,958
It was filling
for the pies I'm making for dessert,

98
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,458
but I can use the berries over there
to make more.

99
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,458
Pansear and their pals
should be picking them now.

100
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,208
I'll bring them to you!

101
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,125
O-Okay…

102
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,541
Hey, wait! At least take the cart!

103
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,458
Thanks for all your help!
Pansage, Pansear, Panpour.

104
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,708
But even so, I wonder
where Psyduck went off to?

105
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:41,875
What?

106
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,291
Come on…

107
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,166
Oh no!

108
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,500
You saved the day!

109
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,041
I'm so happy
you were here to help me, Psyduck.

110
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,125
Psyduck, you don't have to run.

111
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,166
Nobody here is mad, okay?

112
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,208
Is it possible you're worried
about your psychic powers?

113
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,041
When you get a headache,
your psychic powers become active, right?

114
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,000
I wonder if there's a way
we can keep your powers from going wild.

115
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,333
See? You're spraying
all your water at once.

116
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,791
If you let out just a little at a time,
the flowers won't get knocked over.

117
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,875
If you want to control it, then try
letting out a little at a time, Psyduck.

118
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,583
Don't put up with the pain.
Use your psychic power.

119
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,750
Hey, Tyler!

120
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,333
So she caught up with you, huh, Psyduck?

121
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,625
An automated fruit splitter!

122
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,583
Way to go, Psyduck!

123
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,625
Right! Let's try some more stuff!

124
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,291
-Wait, Dad?!
-What?! What's going on?

125
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,625
Whoa! No, no! The crate! The crate!

126
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,291
Psyduck… Let me down, please?

127
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,125
Nice move, Psyduck.

128
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,625
Thank you.

129
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,708
The lids on these tins
are so hard to open.

130
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,125
This kind of candy comes in
all these different cute colors.

131
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,000
They kind of remind me of Pokémon.

132
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,166
See, this one is Hoppip.

133
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,583
This is Mudkip. Here's Bulbasaur.

134
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,416
And the yellow one is Pikach--

135
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,666
No, I mean, it's Psyduck!

136
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,958
When I was a kid,
it was my dream to eat as much as I wanted

137
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,125
the minute I grew up.

138
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,958
It's nice how much freedom adults have.

139
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,125
Psyduck, can you use your psychic power
to toss candy up?

140
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,125
So like…

141
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,041
Wow, you're super good at this!

142
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,291
Whoa! Slow down!
I can't eat that many!

143
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,625
Psyduck.

144
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,000
So, were you having fun just now?

145
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,250
Psyduck!

146
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:38,500
I wish to have fun
with the Pokémon tomorrow, too.
