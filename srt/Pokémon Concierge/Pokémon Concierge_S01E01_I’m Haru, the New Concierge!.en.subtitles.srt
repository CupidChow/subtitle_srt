1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,166
Sorry, babe,
it's just not working out. So, bye.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,208
Last week, on Saturday,

3
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,541
my boyfriend of six and a half years
broke up with me in a text message.

4
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,708
The next day, Sunday,

5
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,375
I wore my favorite shoes
and immediately stepped in gum.

6
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,750
On Monday,
I was late for a vital presentation.

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,541
On Tuesday, my work bestie quit.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,958
Wednesday,
I trimmed my eyebrows all wrong.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,083
Thursday, I spent three hours
making curry, and it sucked.

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,541
Friday, my important presentation failed.

11
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,541
And on Sunday,

12
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:39,833
I stepped in gum again!

13
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,583
And because of that,

14
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,791
I am now here.

15
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:52,500
Hey, Daddy, look! It's a bunch of Wingull!

16
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,791
You can see the island!

17
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,291
Come on, let's get going!

18
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,875
The Pokémon Resort…
I can't believe I'm actually here!

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,916
A Bulbasaur!

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,500
Huh? Is that for me?

21
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,958
Thanks so much!

22
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,791
So you're the new employee?

23
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you for traveling so far
to get here!

24
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,500
Oh, sorry, do you work here?

25
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,708
Excuse me,
I'm going to start working here today.

26
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,416
My name is Haru.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,541
I'm Ms. Watanabe.

28
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,666
Ms. Haru, welcome to the Pokémon Resort.

29
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,791
Thank you so much.

30
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,083
The Pokémon are
really staying here as guests.

31
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,625
See you afterwards, Metagross!

32
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,166
As you can see,

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,791
people and Pokémon can enjoy
the resort together or on their own.

34
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,208
We also have Pokémon on staff.

35
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,166
And sometimes…

36
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,916
A Wooper?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,833
There are also wild Pokémon who call
the resort home. This Wooper, for example.

38
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,833
Around here, our motto is "Pokémon First."

39
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,083
And so, our job

40
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,166
is to take care of these Pokémon
and ensure they enjoy the resort.

41
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,833
In other words,
you'll be the Pokémon concierge.

42
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,333
A concierge, huh?

43
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,458
-Wow!
-Wait up!

44
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,000
What is this?!

45
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,333
What's going on?

46
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,250
Rattata?

47
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,583
That's enough.

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,041
Furret, no running near the pool.

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,375
Shall I take you somewhere
with a bit more room?

50
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,291
It's also a concierge's job
to keep our guests safe.

51
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:39,791
Now then, I know you've just arrived
but I've got a very important job for you.

52
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,791
Uh, right!

53
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:46,291
Then today, you'll stay
and enjoy the resort as a guest.

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,375
Wait. As a guest?

55
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,666
I'm supposed to work here…

56
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,833
Yes, that's right!
Please make yourself at home.

57
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,083
Right…

58
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,791
Oh no, am I being tested here?

59
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,666
Whoa!

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,375
-I think I'll have this!
-Hey, I want to try those lessons!

61
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,625
Hey! Over there!

62
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,500
Why don't you come and give it a try?

63
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,083
Nice to meet you.

64
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,875
It's my first day of work today--

65
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,083
Yeah, you're Haru, right?

66
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,958
My name is Tyler. Sanitation.

67
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,000
And fitness lessons, just for fun.
Nice to meet you!

68
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,583
Yes…

69
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,250
Wh-Who are these Pokémon?

70
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,833
They're on the staff with me.
You could call them my right-hand Pokémon.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,416
They can be real pranksters,
so you'd better watch out.

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,458
Yeah?

73
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,000
So, I'll be--

74
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,083
Yeah! You'll be doing it, right?

75
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,000
Excuse me?

76
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,958
Oh no!

77
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,916
Aren't you glad you warmed up first?

78
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,875
Come and see us again!

79
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:38,083
I also teach swimming,
wakeboarding, and yoga!

80
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,000
Right…

81
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,375
Need a way to get around?

82
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,750
Those orange scooters
are totally free to use.

83
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,166
Hurry up! I'm leaving without you…

84
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,333
Wait for us!

85
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,666
I've never been on one of these before!

86
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,583
That being said,

87
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,625
that guy should look out for newbies
like me, but he was not helpful.

88
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,250
It really is a Pokémon paradise!

89
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,833
All right! Just like that!

90
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,333
Excuse me…

91
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,458
Hello, my name is Haru!
Today is my very first day.

92
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,750
Nice to meet you!

93
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,291
My name is Alisa.

94
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,500
I work here part-time every summer.

95
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,583
Hey there.

96
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,333
Yes, hi, it's so nice to--

97
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,500
Huh? Part time?

98
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
Mudkip!

99
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,208
Are you their Trainer?

100
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,291
Yeah.

101
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,166
They just started following me around.

102
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,500
Did you really?

103
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,291
You're so cute!

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,500
It only does that when it's really happy.

105
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,500
So… What's up?

106
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,125
Well, today is my first day.

107
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,000
And I have no idea
what I'm supposed to be doing.

108
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,791
Do what you want.

109
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,000
You're supposed to be a guest today, no?

110
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,166
I mean…
That's what I was told to do, but…

111
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,583
I'm feeling a lot of pressure right now.

112
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,333
Am I going to get a lecture?

113
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,666
You come with me.

114
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,916
Is she going to rough me up
behind the gym?

115
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,583
Yeah, I guess that'll do.

116
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,708
In here, Pokémon can get
fancy, too, right?

117
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,125
Basic services start off
with a simple trim.

118
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,291
But our guests also love a new fur-style,

119
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,750
and a cute new outfit
can make them extra happy, too.

120
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,750
Still, this kind of thing
is all part of the job.

121
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,791
Oh…

122
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,750
Hey! Lunch is almost ready!

123
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,666
Huh? We get free meals here?

124
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,583
Tyler's cooking.
It's better than you'd think.

125
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,208
Beautiful blue sky…

126
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,041
Beautiful blue ocean…

127
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,916
And a tasty lunch amid the sea breeze.

128
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,833
I'm in paradise!

129
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,000
That was really great!

130
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,416
The Pokémon Resort is the best!

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,250
It's the first time I've felt so relaxed.

132
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,583
Excuse me.
I was told I could get a massage here…?

133
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:35,500
Yes.

134
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,625
Please come right this way.

135
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,833
Huh? Ms. Watanabe, it's your job?

136
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right.

137
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:45,166
I'm so skilled I can make
any Pokémon fall asleep with a touch.

138
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,541
Yeah, but maybe… I don't know…

139
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,916
Just leave it to me!

140
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:04,125
You know… I managed to meet
some of the other staff earlier…

141
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,083
They're all pretty interesting, right?

142
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,958
Yeah. They're definitely unique…

143
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,583
And I noticed

144
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:15,708
they both had
Pokémon of their own with them.

145
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,416
That's right.

146
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
You naturally become friends,
and then you're inseparable.

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,416
I'm sure there'll be
a Pokémon here for you, too.

148
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,791
That sounds so nice…

149
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,083
Ms. Haru?

150
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,375
Oh, no! This is bad.
I was way too relaxed!

151
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,125
And I fell asleep
in front of my supervisor!

152
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,791
I've got to make up for it.

153
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,875
Did you sleep well last night?

154
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:21,958
I guess…

155
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,083
So then…

156
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,208
What did you think of it all?
Could you tell me about your day?

157
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,958
Here it is!

158
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,208
What's this?

159
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,916
Right! I built a report
on my activities yesterday

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,916
and drafted some
personal work policies for myself.

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,208
We know the Pokémon Resort gives
a luxurious experience, so the--

162
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,125
Hold on.

163
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,458
As much as I appreciate
your data compilation,

164
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,791
honestly, I was hoping for
a different kind of answer.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,666
S-So sorry!

166
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,791
My presentation was inadequate.
I'll try again!

167
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,625
Say, Ms. Haru…

168
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,458
How did yesterday go?

169
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,791
When you ask me "how"…

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,041
I can't possibly know
the right answer to this!

171
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,500
Ms. Haru? Are you all right?

172
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,333
No… It was just super funny…

173
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,500
What's funny?

174
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:46,333
The Pokémon here are doing
what they want and having fun,

175
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:49,833
and when I saw that, I realized
how silly all my problems have been.

176
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,291
Recently, I've had
a series of stressful incidents.

177
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,125
And it made me wonder,
what is the point of my life?

178
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,291
But this place popped those bad feelings
just like a balloon, and it was so fun!

179
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,208
Oh… I'm sorry!

180
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,916
Here I'm a professional,
but I'm talking like a toddler…

181
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,750
No, that is exactly what I wanted.

182
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,666
Huh?

183
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,916
It's about having fun,
and now you understand.

184
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,833
This here is proof
that you are a concierge.

185
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,083
The rule is,
you have to wear it while working.

186
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,458
Aside from that, there are no other rules.

187
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,000
Here.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,916
Thanks…

189
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,833
So then, what are my duties
as a concierge?

190
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,958
Well, I have one request.

191
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,416
Choose a Pokémon, and before the sun sets,

192
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,666
I want you to make the Pokémon feel
the same way that you do.

193
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,041
This job is impossible!

194
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,583
I didn't want to let her see it,

195
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,125
but I have no idea what I'm supposed
to do to complete this task.

196
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,208
What do I do?

197
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,833
A Psyduck?
