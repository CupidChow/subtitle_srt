1
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,833
Welcome to the Pokémon Resort, everyone!

2
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,583
I'm Haru, your Concierge!

3
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,416
On this unspoiled island,

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,041
the Pokémon, together with their trainers,

5
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,583
will relax and enjoy various activities.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,833
We, the Pokémon Concierges,
will do our best

7
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:50,916
to help you to relax
and enjoy yourselves here.

8
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,708
I hope you'll enjoy the stay
at the Pokémon Resort,

9
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,041
away from the hustle and bustle.

10
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,000
-Hi!
-Hello!

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,166
Hey, Haru!

12
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,333
Tyler!

13
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,666
Your rucksack…
You're gonna go on board the ship?

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,750
Oh, yeah!

15
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,250
That means you're off today too?

16
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,416
No, I'm working!

17
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,250
I'm gonna stock up more berries!

18
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,416
What?
Weren't you gonna do that next month?

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,208
Yeah, I was.

20
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,625
But they suddenly rung me this morning,
and asked me to come today.

21
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:56,500
But Alisa won't be back until tomorrow,
will she?

22
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,750
That's right!

23
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:00,125
It's her sister's wedding today, right?

24
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,583
She'll enjoy her rare chance
to relax, I guess!

25
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,750
Welp, you're at the helm now, Captain!
Good luck!

26
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,583
How could you…

27
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:14,250
You'll be okay, won't you? Ms. Watanabe
will be back from her business trip today.

28
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,250
Did you say you can't come back?

29
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,958
Yes, I haven't even managed
to check out yet.

30
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,666
There's a terrible storm here.

31
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,833
You've got to be kidding…

32
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,958
But today Shinx and Luxray come
to stay for the first time,

33
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,625
so I'll try my best to be
back in the afternoon.

34
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,625
Ms. Watanabe, you don't need
to come back today.

35
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,541
What?

36
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:45,166
You mustn't get injured in the storm.
I'll manage on my own here somehow.

37
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,500
Are you sure?

38
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,583
Of course, just leave everything to me!

39
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,500
Well…

40
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,750
So if you could do that, please?
Thanks so much!

41
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,875
If you need help, ask the receptionists.
They'll help you.

42
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,083
And the Pokémon will be of great help,
I'm sure!

43
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,666
All right!

44
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,375
What does it say?
Cook thoroughly for Pansear, then…

45
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,291
Those I peeled earlier will be deep-fried,

46
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,708
then blanched, then…

47
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,166
Naughty Trubbish!

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,625
Oh, for heaven's sake!

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,458
Just try to get along with each other,
will you?

50
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,625
What's the matter, Luxray?

51
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,375
What? The fire's gone out!

52
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,375
Mudkip!

53
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:50,916
Thanks so much!

54
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,875
But why are you here?

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,666
Oh, I forgot!
I have to tend the vegetable patch!

56
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,333
Oh, Diglett!

57
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,708
Oh, no! I've just sown something there!

58
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,166
Oh, Luxray, don't dig holes!

59
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,500
Shinx and Mudkip, calm down!

60
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,625
Wait a sec, Psyduck!

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,458
Dragonite! Pidgeot, you too!

62
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,458
Sorry, guys.

63
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,958
Will you play somewhere else today?

64
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,541
What's the matter, Eevee?

65
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,833
Oh, I forgot!

66
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,416
Here, this is your summer look!

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,708
So nice and cool!

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,083
Well…

69
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,125
How about this?

70
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,791
This suits you! You look great!

71
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,333
It's okay.

72
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,208
I'm just trying to cut your nails.

73
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,583
It doesn't hurt!

74
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,916
How can I survive a day like this?

75
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,791
Your hand feels so nice.

76
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,541
Hand?

77
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,541
Oh, I've got an idea!

78
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,416
Everybody lend a hand, please!

79
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,000
Wow, you're so good at massage, Corphish!

80
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,791
Ouch, it's hot!

81
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,916
Oh, it's beautiful!

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,333
Thank you, Luxray and Shinx!

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,708
From now on, I'll call you Mr. Chef.

84
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,000
So it's true that
even Pokémon can lend a hand.

85
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,916
I'm so glad they enjoyed helping me.

86
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:35,916
But now I understand
that Tyler, Alisa and Ms. Watanabe,

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,083
they all look so happy at work,

88
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,708
but their jobs are actually so hard.

89
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,958
They are happy because they work hard,

90
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,583
and they are able to work hard because
they know they'll feel happy as a result.

91
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,166
What's happened?

92
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,291
What's going on?

93
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,791
-Hi, you've reached the front desk!
-Thank god you answered at last!

94
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,333
Oh, is that Haru?

95
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,750
We're in trouble as there's a power outage
affecting all the buildings.

96
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,666
Do you know what happened?

97
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,708
They said it's probably a malfunction of
the power storage device.

98
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,250
It looks as if the device has stopped
transmitting power.

99
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,083
Oh, my God!

100
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,583
They say the power should
come back on if we restart the device.

101
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,750
But we're too busy to do that
at the moment.

102
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,958
Haru, could you please do that?

103
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,375
Me? Are you serious?

104
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm not sure…

105
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,041
What in the world? Oy, Gengar, stop it!

106
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,916
There it is!

107
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,916
Okay!

108
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,666
Then, now…

109
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,750
What should I do now?

110
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,125
This is the right switch, isn't it?

111
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,041
Now to restart!

112
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,708
Why doesn't it work!

113
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,708
What can I do?

114
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,125
The sun will be gone soon…

115
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,791
Apparently,
the windmill can generate electricity.

116
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,041
If only there were a wind…

117
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,791
I know!

118
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,625
If there's no wind, let's create it!

119
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,208
I'm relying on you, Dragonite and Pidgeot!

120
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,291
It's working!

121
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,750
Calm down, you two!

122
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,041
-It's on!
-Oh, it's on!

123
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,666
Hooray! They've done it!

124
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank god…

125
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,791
Watch out…

126
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,416
Are you okay?

127
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,291
Thank you for your help!
You've done more than enough.

128
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,291
What's that?

129
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,875
Shinx! Luxray! Are you gonna help?

130
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,041
Okay, we're ready!

131
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,375
Now, please start!

132
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,916
Fantastic! It's charging!

133
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:17,958
No…

134
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,708
After all,
I couldn't do anything on my own.

135
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,958
Tyler would've organized everyone so that
we could've got out of this situation.

136
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,958
Alisa would have come up
with some brilliant idea.

137
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,666
As for Ms. Watanabe,

138
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,625
I don't know how but she would have
solved the problem for sure.

139
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,666
The Pokémon were such great help
and I went and wasted all their efforts.

140
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,791
Everyone must be having a tough time.

141
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,125
What's that?

142
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,500
Wow!

143
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,666
Incredible.

144
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,041
Wow.

145
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,500
Look! It's Snorlax!

146
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,333
Pokémon sure are amazing.

147
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,625
Hey, Haru.

148
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,125
Why on earth are you sleeping here?

149
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,166
-Alisa!
-What's this?

150
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,833
What happened to you yesterday?

151
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,375
Good mornin', Haru!

152
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,541
Tyler!

153
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,708
Hi, Haru. I'm back.

154
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,708
Ms. Watanabe!

155
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,416
Was the weather okay?

156
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:12,083
It all cleared up as soon as
I stepped out of the hotel.

157
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,166
I forgot that I always somehow attract
good weather.

158
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,250
Looks as if Shinx and Luxray have
enjoyed themselves here.

159
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,250
So, how was yesterday, Haru?

160
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,416
I heard it was wild. How did you handle
that all by yourself?

161
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,041
Yeah, it was so…

162
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,083
much fun because I was with the Pokémon!

163
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,666
You're getting bolder.

164
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,333
Well, you worked so hard, Haru.

165
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,750
Thanks!

166
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,208
Got something for you.

167
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,750
Oh, thank you!

168
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,125
And this is from me. Thank you, Haru.

169
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,291
And here's something from me.

170
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,333
You did so well, Haru.
I really appreciate it!

171
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,250
Oh, thank you so much!

172
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,750
Oh, these are all chocolates!

173
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,750
Are you kidding?

174
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,541
Don't get a hole in your teeth!

175
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,583
These are my reward!

176
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,750
Wait, Psyduck!

177
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,250
So, let's do our best
and have fun together, everyone!

178
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:04,041
