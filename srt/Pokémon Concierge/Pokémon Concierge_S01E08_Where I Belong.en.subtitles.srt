1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,583
We have an important announcement
for all guests of the resort.

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,833
We're currently experiencing heavy rain
and high winds on the island today.

3
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,833
Due to the inclement weather,
all outdoor activities have been canceled.

4
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,333
For your safety
and the safety of your Pokémon,

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:29,208
please make your way
to the indoor facilities,

6
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,750
which remain open at this time.

7
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,666
Haru!

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,250
Look sharp and be careful!

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,250
Right!

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,916
The river's so high, it's gonna flood.

11
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,166
That's not good!

12
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm gonna head upstream
and check on the Magikarp!

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,708
Haru, get these Pokémon
to the lobby as soon as you can!

14
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,916
Yeah! Right!

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,583
Be careful, okay?

16
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,958
Yeah, you too!

17
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,625
It's already flooding out of control.

18
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,208
It washed the bridge away!

19
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:11,791
Eevee!

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,416
I'm so sorry!

21
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,208
It's fine! Don't move! Stay there!

22
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,583
I could really use your help, Bulbasaur!

23
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,125
Closer. Just a little closer.

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,625
Eevee! Jump into my arms!
C'mon, you can do it!

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,791
Steady, Eevee!

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Arcanine?

27
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,541
Hey, thank you!

28
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,250
Wait.

29
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,125
Do I know you?
You seem so familiar. Who are you?

30
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,250
Arcanine!

31
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,083
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Thanks, I'm fine.

32
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,208
Kent?

33
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,750
Haru?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,125
Haru…

35
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,791
Your hair's wet. You want a towel?

36
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,583
Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,791
Thanks, Kent.

38
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,333
I didn't know you were staying here.

39
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,875
Y'see, I was off when you arrived.

40
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah, gotcha.

41
00:02:57,166 --> 00:03:00,083
You know, I haven't seen you in a while.

42
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,875
Sorry about the whole river thing.

43
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,750
Nah.

44
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,208
I'm glad you're doing well.

45
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,458
Mommy! Do you know when
the rain's gonna stop?

46
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,958
Oh yeah. That guy's
totally her ex, no doubt.

47
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,541
For real?

48
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,166
Oh, Haru! She should
just stay away from that guy!

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,458
Calm down. It's not like you're her dad.

50
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,333
What's wrong, Psyduck?

51
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,708
I think Psyduck's a little jealous of
the ex getting all the attention.

52
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,083
Ya know…

53
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,875
I was really surprised.

54
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,208
I never thought you'd be
a concierge at a resort.

55
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,583
Who, me?

56
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,041
-But why not?
-C'mon, Haru.

57
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,500
Your life used to revolve
around high heels

58
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,458
and giving higher-pressure presentations.

59
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,541
And now…

60
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,375
I'm covered in mud.

61
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,958
Soaked and wearing sandals and sweatpants.

62
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,083
No, I…

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,416
-I'm sorry.
-No worries.

64
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,208
So…

65
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,041
I've been promoted to area manager.

66
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,041
Yeah? Congratulations!

67
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,125
Thanks so much!

68
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,375
I thought that a good way to celebrate
would be to come to this island.

69
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,291
To have a really good time with Arcanine.

70
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,666
That's great.

71
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,916
The weather will
definitely clear up tomorrow,

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,583
so I hope you have fun!

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,208
Thanks so much.

74
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,541
This is unreal!

75
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,958
I never thought Kent would ever come here!

76
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,125
So many feels!

77
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,625
These are from
our very first vacation together.

78
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,250
Psyduck, look!

79
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,916
What's that face for?

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,708
Yes, that's really what I looked like
when I was younger.

81
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,416
Kent seems like he's really grown up.

82
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,375
But also, he seems to look
incredibly tired.

83
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,708
You know what?

84
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,458
Since the rain stopped, let's make sure
Kent and Arcanine have the best day ever.

85
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,500
What's that cool-looking spot there?

86
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,125
That's the athletic ground, you see?

87
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,958
-Good morning everyone!
-Trainers and their Pokémon…

88
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,583
-Are you observing some rare Pokémon?
-Does it get busy?

89
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,833
Gotta go. Lots to do today
and I don't wanna fall behind.

90
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,500
Sealeo!

91
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,916
Hi!

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,750
You're too heavy. Please get up!

93
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,541
Look!

94
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,708
Bon appétit!

95
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,041
Thanks a lot.

96
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,708
It's really good!

97
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,041
You chased it away? Good job, Mudkip!

98
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,875
Drenched yet again!

99
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,541
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,458
It's a lot more hectic today than usual.

101
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,041
Yeah.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,041
Oh, no… What's wrong?

103
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,291
Haru, I…

104
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,666
You must've been really unhappy back home.

105
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,333
So you had to get out.

106
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:47,125
I'm so sorry I didn't see that.

107
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,208
What?

108
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,916
-I don't--
-Haru!

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,958
Can you come help me with these berries?

110
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,416
Uh-huh! Sure thing!

111
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,791
I'll be right over!

112
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,291
Sorry! Duty calls! Be right back!

113
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,375
Okay.

114
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,041
Haru's such a wonderful employee
and has been doing quite well here.

115
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,125
I…

116
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,833
I'm sure she is.

117
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,833
Haru may seem awkward at times,

118
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,916
but she's very well-suited
for her concierge position.

119
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,708
The way she always puts
the needs of others first

120
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,333
is something I've never seen before.

121
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,333
Today she took care of Arcanine.
It's suffering from dry paws.

122
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,833
So she came to me early this morning
and asked for some cream.

123
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,333
Noticing certain things
Trainers might overlook

124
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,500
is one of Haru's most helpful qualities.

125
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,375
-And this one?
-That goes right over there.

126
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,208
-'Kay! Got it!
-Hold onto that.

127
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,833
The view from up here
is absolutely breathtaking!

128
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,625
Whoa!

129
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,416
I know, right? I love this island so much.

130
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,041
I was thinking,

131
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,666
maybe I was trying to get away
from everything when I first came here.

132
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,416
However, now it just feels like home.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,916
Okay.

134
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,916
I understand.

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,083
Oh, yeah!

136
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,583
Our whole team put this slide together!

137
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:13,166
It was a huge job
and took us about two months to build,

138
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,333
but all of our guests love it,
especially the Pokémon!

139
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,166
Follow me, Arcanine!

140
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,750
Yeah! Let's go!

141
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,000
Wow…

142
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,500
Hey, you guys! Come on down!
Don't be scared! It's awesome!

143
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,958
All right, here I go.

144
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,000
Man, Haru sure is young at heart.
She's really acting like a kid.

145
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,500
Kent, you should see yourself right now!

146
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,541
What, I'm a joke to you?

147
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,041
Hey, watch where you're goin', Psyduck.

148
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,541
Finally.

149
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,333
I was hoping that
I could finally get you to laugh.

150
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:09,958
I'm happy

151
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,750
because you're wonderful.

152
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,083
Psyduck? What's wrong?

153
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,083
Wait! Where's Arcanine?

154
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,125
Dunno. I thought it was
right behind Psyduck.

155
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,583
What happened? Are ya stuck, Arcanine?

156
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,916
Hang tight. I'll pull ya out.

157
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,250
What's wrong?

158
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,375
Kent, no! Arcanine's paws, remember?

159
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,416
Sorry, Arcanine! I know!

160
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,333
I could use its Poké Ball for this!

161
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,875
Poké Ball… Where is it?

162
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,541
I can't find it! Where did I put it?

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Could you help me, Psyduck?
I have an idea!

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,291
Arcanine!

165
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey! It's gonna be okay!

166
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,541
Tickle, tickle…

167
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,625
You're okay!

168
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,125
Tickle, tickle…

169
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,916
Haru…

170
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,833
Arcanine!

171
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,625
I'm glad you're all right!

172
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,916
Everything okay? How's Arcanine?

173
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,916
Yeah, it seems just fine.

174
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,333
Haru… How did you do that?

175
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,083
Thought if I could get Arcanine to laugh,
it would just let go.

176
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,916
Just let go?

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,791
It's how I used to be.

178
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,916
I thought about how I acted back then.

179
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,625
Every day I just worked harder,
struggling from burnout.

180
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,125
I was desperately trying
to improve myself,

181
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,541
but I managed to somehow
fall behind instead.

182
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,000
It was rough. Who was I going to be
if I kept living like that?

183
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,333
It's like I was resisting something
and it was holding me back.

184
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,250
-Haru…
-I finally realized

185
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,125
that I had to stop fighting with myself.

186
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,333
Once I let go and relaxed,
I actually laughed until I cried.

187
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,916
Suddenly, I was able to
move forward without any effort.

188
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,333
Moving here helped a lot.

189
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,458
Working actually makes me happy.

190
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,041
No more stress.
And I'm able to work harder too.

191
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
Ya know what?

192
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,041
-I think that you're really cool, Haru.
-What?

193
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,833
No, no! You're making a joke, right?

194
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,916
I'm not cool!

195
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,125
Haru, look I…

196
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,666
Nothing.

197
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:37,833
This has been great.

198
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,250
And I feel like I'm recharged for work.

199
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,375
Good!

200
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,458
You got this!

201
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,625
What's up, Arcanine?

202
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,416
Haru…

203
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,916
I want to thank you.

204
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,833
Thank you too.

205
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,833
Psyduck, what was that for?

206
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,791
Love you too, Arcanine.

207
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,291
You're so funny, Psyduck!

208
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,833
Ready?

209
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,375
Onward to a brand-new day!

210
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,291
Sometimes there's a storm in the sky.

211
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,750
And sometimes
there's a storm in your heart.

212
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,833
But no matter what,

213
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,708
your strength will always help to guide
you through whatever life may bring.

214
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,666
Even though there are bound to be
bumps along the road,

215
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,375
as long as you never give up,
you can overcome any obstacle.

216
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,833
And our wonderful friends
that we've made along the way

217
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,875
always remind us that we're never alone.

218
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,083
Good work!

219
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,791
Thanks! Bring 'em over here!

220
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,666
I know, but I hope you had a good time.

221
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,958
-Bye bye!
-Hope to see you folks again soon!

222
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,916
Come back soon, okay?

223
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,500
I've made my decision.

224
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,416
I want to stay here

225
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,833
because this is my home.

226
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:47,500
I've looked for you for so long

227
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,791
I finally found you on this island

228
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:58,083
For us to be able to watch

229
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:02,375
This beautiful sunset together

230
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,916
When I was alone

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,625
When I was lonely

232
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,958
I thought of you

233
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:19,166
Please tell me and only me

234
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,416
The sound of your

235
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:28,833
Secret onomatopoeia

236
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,583
This is a healing island

237
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,250
A sparkling island

238
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:42,416
It's overflowing with love

239
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,666
You act shy and timid when

240
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,541
I press my cheek against yours

241
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,125
As we hug

242
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,875
And hold hands

243
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:14,500
My heart was always looking down

244
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,916
My head hung low

245
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:25,125
I may not have been unhappy

246
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:30,208
But I struggled under the weight of living

247
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:35,583
It's all in the past now

248
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:40,291
It blew away with the wind

249
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:46,125
The machinery of smiles

250
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:51,166
Fills my heart full

251
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,041
Overflowing, unable to contain it

252
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,583
Come to the healing island

253
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,250
An exciting island

254
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:09,458
Immerse yourself inside this fluffy love

255
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:15,125
Unravel the puzzle that will solve

256
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,208
This complicated maze

257
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,958
And open the door

258
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,916
With you on this healing island

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,541
A smooth island

260
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:35,875
A complicated love is fine

261
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:41,583
We don't have to become adults

262
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,916
We can stay forever

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,250
In this bright moratorium of youth

264
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,416
Onomatopoeia Island

265
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,000
A sparkling island

266
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,625
A fluffy island

267
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,208
A woolly island

268
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,916
A smooth island

269
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,875
A squishy island

270
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,125
I press my cheek against yours

271
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,875
As we hug

272
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,083
And hold hands

273
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,500
