1
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,166
Lost in the moment again.

2
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,875
Of course! It's a tour group
with 12 different Pikachu!

3
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,666
It feels so incredible!

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,000
So you're a hopeless Pikachu lover.

5
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,000
Just look at that soft, fluffy fur!

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,250
Those big round eyes,
so sharp and focused.

7
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,541
They're just so iconic, you know?

8
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,250
It even makes me happy
to see them this far away.

9
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,750
That's cool, but we're still working here.
Don't get distracted, Haru.

10
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,916
I won't!

11
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,458
Yeah, I know.
We'll be heading out soon, Psyduck.

12
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:16,458
What?

13
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:19,500
Pikachu!

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,375
What's wrong?

15
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,416
You don't want to play with your friends?

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,166
Pikachu! So this is where you ran off to?

17
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,333
Are you their Trainer?

18
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,416
Yes. And who are you?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,958
I'm a concierge here
at the Pokémon Resort.

20
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,416
My name's Haru. Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:42,916
My name is Nao.

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,416
Okay, Nao.

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,750
It seems like
you have a shy little Pikachu.

24
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:51,541
Yeah. They aren't really social at all.
And their voice is so quiet.

25
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,416
I wish Pikachu was
more Pikachu-like, you know?

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,333
Huh?

27
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,208
I mean, Pikachu are
always so cute and energetic!

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,833
At the very least,
I want them to have a louder voice,

29
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,000
but no matter how much we train,
nothing ever works.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,750
Is that so?

31
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,041
And so, when I asked
other Pikachu Trainers for advice,

32
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,875
they recommended this in-person meetup
at the Pokémon Resort.

33
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,250
Sounds good.

34
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,333
Okay, Pikachu. Go and play!

35
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:23,833
Come on! You can do it!

36
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,625
Seems like they're all having fun.

37
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,666
Say, why don't we play together, Nao?

38
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,583
Huh?

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,250
You and I can play with Pikachu.
Out in the resort!

40
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,041
Hey, Pikachu? Do you want to play with me?

41
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,458
Are they gonna be all right?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,875
Let's let Haru take care of it.

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,208
See? There are all kinds of ways
to play around here.

44
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,375
I want to try that!

45
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,958
Pikachu, let's do it together!

46
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,666
Come on, Psyduck.

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,041
Show Pikachu how fun this can be.

48
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,583
Psyduck is so funny!

49
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,208
Pikachu, you have to do it
even cooler, okay?

50
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,958
Okay, Nao,
why don't you go with Pikachu and--

51
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,750
I'll go first, okay? So you just copy me!

52
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,708
Yeah! Here I go!

53
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,958
Huh? Hey, hold on!

54
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:44,875
I'm off!

55
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,291
There's nothing to be scared of!
Come on, Pikachu!

56
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,916
Let's go, okay, Pikachu.

57
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,375
Huh? Pikachu?

58
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,250
Could it be
you're a little afraid of heights?

59
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,500
That could have been cooler, Pikachu.

60
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,500
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare Pikachu.

61
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:20,083
Haru, can you think of anything
that will help Pikachu be louder?

62
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,000
Huh?

63
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,750
Yoo-hoo!

64
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,500
It's super fun! So now, you all try it!

65
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,583
Pikachu!

66
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,333
Come on, you try it too, Pikachu!

67
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,291
Ready, set…

68
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,000
Mission: Echo status? Failed.

69
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:07,916
Next one!

70
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,791
-Thank you, Tyler!
-Thank you, Tyler!

71
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,125
That's hot!

72
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,708
Mission: Frighten-to-Death status? Failed.

73
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,625
Next one!

74
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,750
Mission: Cry of Alarm status? Failed.

75
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,208
So, Haru… Is she gonna be okay?

76
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,666
She's just fine.

77
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,291
Just another day
at work for Haru, you know?

78
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,208
That's for sure.

79
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,375
Delicious!

80
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:27,791
Haru, do you think that
my Pikachu is sick somehow?

81
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:35,291
I'm no doctor so I couldn't be certain,
but they don't seem to be sick.

82
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,250
What's up?

83
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,291
It's nothing.

84
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:49,208
We could try making them sneeze somehow
or give them a painful foot massage.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,750
They both fell asleep.

86
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,208
Th-they're so cute!

87
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
A picture!
I have to take a picture of this!

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh no! Did I forget to charge it?

89
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,416
Battery! Where's my backup battery?

90
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,583
It doesn't really
look like Pikachu at all.

91
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,750
Pikachu have those round
but sharp and focused eyes,

92
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,416
and they just look so iconic…

93
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,791
I mean, Pikachu are always
so cute and energetic!

94
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,541
Hey, Nao,

95
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,250
once Pikachu and Psyduck wake up,
we should all go to the beach.

96
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,958
They look like they're having fun.

97
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,125
We have all kinds
of guests that come here.

98
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,958
We've had a Duskull
that was afraid of the dark.

99
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,750
A Houndour that was just afraid,

100
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,791
and an Oricorio
that was too embarrassed to dance.

101
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,208
Isn't that something?

102
00:07:56,333 --> 00:08:01,666
And even for me, when I first came here,
I felt that I had to act like an adult.

103
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,958
That a concierge
had to be cool at all times.

104
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,291
I had so much anxiety.

105
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,583
The thing is,
once you start thinking like that,

106
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,875
it can be really easy to get stuck.

107
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,708
That's why, for Pikachu,

108
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,208
we don't need to force them
into being "Pikachu-like."

109
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
They don't really need
to make loud noises.

110
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,625
And they may not be any good at battles.

111
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,041
But Pikachu is still Pikachu.

112
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,333
Don't you think?

113
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,208
Actually,

114
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,500
I tried to come up with all sorts of
plans to get Pikachu to be louder,

115
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,916
but nothing worked out.

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,250
I'm sorry!

117
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,666
But to make it up to you,

118
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,500
let me show you
a fun new thing you can do!

119
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,458
Let's go, Psyduck!

120
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,041
What was all that about, Psyduck?!

121
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,958
See? Now it's your turn, Pikachu!

122
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,541
Want to go together, Pikachu?

123
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,208
Later! See you at next year's meetup!

124
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,500
Take care!

125
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,125
Hey, Haru!

126
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,916
They never did make
a loud sound, did they?

127
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,416
I'm sorry I wasn't much help there.

128
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,458
Not at all.

129
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,250
I had so much fun!

130
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,166
And I think Pikachu had a great time too.

131
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
You think so? I'm happy to hear it!

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,958
Not only that, but I learned a lot of
great things about my Pikachu!

133
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,083
Really?

134
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,458
Can we come and play here again sometime?

135
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,416
Of course! Let's play together then!

136
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,625
Pikachu, this is a kind of
souvenir picture for you.

137
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,666
The ship is about to depart!

138
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,875
Okay, let's go, Pikachu!

139
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,750
Pikachu, I'm glad you made some friends!

140
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,250
All right, time to head back.

141
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,583
Yeah.

142
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,500
And I should get started on lunch.

143
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,791
Was that the shy little Pikachu?

144
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,541
Let's have fun again, Pikachu!

145
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,875
It's all thanks to Haru, yeah?

146
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,250
Pretty good work there, Haru.

147
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,625
It's not…

148
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,458
I didn't do anything. It was Psyduck.

149
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,458
So why are you crying?

150
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:44,583
Because I'm so happy for you, Pikachu!

151
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:56,166
Another day to do my best and have fun!

152
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:57,958
Let's go, Psyduck!

153
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,041
And because of that,

154
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,916
I am now here.

155
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,208
Hello. Pokémon Resort.

156
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,583
Yes.

157
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,875
Yes, of course we do. We'll be waiting.

158
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,666
Ms. Haru, could you come here for a sec?

159
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,625
Okay!

160
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,625
The next guest will soon be at the resort.

161
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,041
I wonder who it is?

162
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,625
Maybe Clefairy? Or maybe it's Mimikyu?

163
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,166
My goodness gracious.

164
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,625
Ms. Haru, could you go and greet
our guest at the port?

165
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,958
Y-Yes!

166
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,625
What? Nobody's here…

167
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,041
