1
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,125
Hey there! Everyone good?

2
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,750
Hold on, Sealeo! Wait a minute!

3
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:35,500
Yo!

4
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,250
Are you okay?

5
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,583
I'm… good… thanks.

6
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,000
What? The ship's not leaving?

7
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,708
No. One of the crew is leaving next week,
unfortunately,

8
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,000
and they can't find a replacement in time.

9
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,958
Maybe they should've made it a priority
to hire some new staff by now.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
And we're also short-handed.

11
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,000
True enough.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,875
-Is Sealeo around anywhere?
-Wait, Sealeo!

13
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,000
Come back!

14
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,833
Where're ya goin'?!

15
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,625
Just look at that energy!

16
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:18,500
Hey, Haru! Alisa!
I'm beggin' you, help!

17
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,125
-Wait!
-All right, all right.

18
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,625
Stop! Come back!

19
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,750
Pansage! Panpour!
Pansear! I'm countin' on you!

20
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,083
Let's go!

21
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,833
Sealeo, stop! Don't move!

22
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,708
Calm down. Good Sealeo.

23
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,833
Sorry, Sealeo is causing you
so much trouble. I know it's a lot.

24
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,000
That's fine. No problem, Uncle Dan!

25
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,666
-Uncle Dan!
-Uncle Dan!

26
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,916
Back when I was a tiny little dude,
my uncle here watched over me.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,833
We always loved to ride the gnarly waves
on his sick boat!

28
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,416
You have a boat?

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Of course!
I used to be a fisherman a while back.

30
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,583
So cool!

31
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:36,000
I remember that Uncle Dan was super tough!

32
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,000
A real powerful
and strong-lookin' kinda guy!

33
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,500
And when I was rude,

34
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,375
he would get so mad,

35
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,666
you could hear him
throughout the entire neighborhood!

36
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

37
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,666
No way! I can't believe that!

38
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,791
Sure. Go get it!

39
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,250
Nice catch, Sealeo!

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,166
All right, all right.
Sealeo, that's enough. Calm down.

41
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,166
Sealeo really loves you, Dan.

42
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,583
Ya know, Sealeo was just a Spheal
when we floated into each other's lives.

43
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,166
I was a young fisherman back then.

44
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,166
I was out at sea, fishing
on my boat as usual, when suddenly,

45
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,875
a Spheal that was swimming by
hopped right onto my boat.

46
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,916
I kept trying to return the Pokémon
to the sea,

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,833
but each time I did,
it would leap back onto the boat.

48
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,375
I wondered if this poor Spheal was lonely
and just needed some company.

49
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:35,375
It was very friendly,
so I quickly grew attached to it.

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:42,291
So I decided,
that maybe I should be Spheal's Trainer.

51
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,458
The two of us have been inseparable ever
since. It eventually evolved into Sealeo.

52
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,500
That's amazing Sealeo! Congrats!

53
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,208
I'm impressed, Uncle Dan!

54
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:55,291
It's a challenge. You never realize
how huge a Spheal will get.

55
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,541
How's Sealeo at home?
You have an apartment don't you?

56
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,958
-Do you live close to the sea at all?
-No…

57
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,958
Unfortunately, my son and his wife
insisted I live near them.

58
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,541
I said all right, but it's tough to manage
a Sealeo instead of a Spheal.

59
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,625
Pokémon sizes can be different
when they evolve.

60
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,625
So then, is Sealeo
in its Poké Ball all the time?

61
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,958
I can only let Sealeo out
in a nearby park occasionally.

62
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:28,958
Looks like Sealeo's a little overexcited,
since it never has enough space

63
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,791
for playing or swimming outside.

64
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:36,291
But now, I'm afraid Sealeo's causing
trouble around here for everyone else.

65
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,291
Don't you worry!

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,041
On this island, our goal is to make sure

67
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,291
the Pokémon are having
as much fun as they'd like!

68
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,791
Have a ton of fun today, Dedenne!

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,333
Frozen goodies!

70
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,208
Okay, Dan! Ready when you are!

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,250
Wow!

72
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,083
Look at that!

73
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,500
Your Sealeo
is having a wonderful time today!

74
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,666
Oh!

75
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,000
I haven't seen Sealeo this happy
in a very long time.

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,416
How long have you and Sealeo
known each other, Dan?

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,708
For about fifteen years now.

78
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,375
I remember how small it used to be
when it was a wee baby Spheal.

79
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,791
It was so cute waddling around
on its short little legs

80
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,208
and it rolled up happily
whenever I came home.

81
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,625
Back then… I was surprised it gave me
so much happiness.

82
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,375
POKÉMON CONCIERGE

83
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
Oh, Tyler. Hi.

84
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,625
Why are you calling me at this hour?

85
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,625
Yeah. Uh-huh. What?

86
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,791
All right.

87
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,125
I see. Yes.

88
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,833
Could you keep a look out
just in case he returns?

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,208
I can't find him,
and his room's cleaned out.

90
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm afraid he's not in the lobby
or outside on the terrace either.

91
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,625
But why?

92
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,041
I'm stumped.

93
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,375
He just left Sealeo here.
Where in the world could he have gone?

94
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,208
Did we look behind this pool
or this tent though?

95
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,166
No. We can try to look there.

96
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,416
Hey, Tyler. Try along the river.

97
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,125
-Tyler!
-Uh-huh!

98
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,208
Sorry!

99
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,666
I'll uh…

100
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,958
I'll have another look
down by the waterfall.

101
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,291
Hang on! I'll join you!

102
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,625
Sealeo, wait!

103
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,208
Tyler, wait!

104
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,833
I have an idea where Dan is.

105
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,916
Do you think he might be on the ship?

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

107
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,291
Don't worry, I'll head there now!

108
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,291
The ship's gonna leave soon,
so I gotta hurry!

109
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,125
Look! There he is!

110
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,708
Dan, wait!

111
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,083
Dan, please!

112
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,166
But why?

113
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,083
Hey, Sealeo, wait!

114
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,500
Attention, passengers.

115
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,166
-We've stopped temporarily
-Mommy, Mommy!

116
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,791
-for a safety check.
-Look at that Sealeo,

117
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,625
-what's the matter with it?
-Once we're finished,

118
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:51,708
we'll resume our course.

119
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,791
In the meantime,

120
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,083
-thank you for your patience.
-Excuse me. Coming through.

121
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,208
Sorry, please excuse me.

122
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,250
Sealeo, no!
Get away from the ship. It's dangerous!

123
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
Go back to the harbor!

124
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,250
Attention, passengers.

125
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,875
We must return to the Pokémon Resort.

126
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,458
We apologize
for any inconvenience this may cause.

127
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,333
Sealeo, what's going on?

128
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,333
Sorry.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Forgive me.

130
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,875
Why, Dan? You just…

131
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,166
Please, Uncle.

132
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,083
What was your plan?
Were you trying to abandon Sealeo here?

133
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,583
Ms. Watanabe.

134
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,458
No, I would never dream of such a thing.

135
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,958
Leaving your Pokémon behind
is the very definition of "abandoned."

136
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,333
May I ask
why you felt the need to leave it?

137
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,708
Do you know how difficult it can be
to take care of a Pokémon this big?

138
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:59,166
I just can't keep up with it anymore.
Believe me, I wish I could.

139
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,750
Pokémon can evolve at any time.

140
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,208
And they usually become a lot bigger.

141
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,916
If you weren't prepared to handle this,

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,291
then you never should've had one
in the first place.

143
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,125
Right.

144
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,291
But Uncle…

145
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,125
Tyler, wait!

146
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,250
Haru, don't.

147
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,083
Tyler would always speak highly of you

148
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,708
and say how proud he was
to be your nephew.

149
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,791
So brave, and always helping others.

150
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,708
He looked up to you and admired you.

151
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,458
I'm sorry for causing trouble.

152
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,208
You've always been
a really great role model, Uncle.

153
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,416
I never thought you'd walk away
from something so important.

154
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,958
Now, I'm not so sure.

155
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,291
Yeah, I'm disappointed in myself too.

156
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,125
I wanna do what's right.

157
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,625
It was okay when Sealeo was a Spheal.

158
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,416
But when it evolved, everything changed.

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,333
And I became so anxious about the future

160
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,125
and what could possibly happen to us.

161
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,208
Why?

162
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,375
Well it's gonna keep getting bigger
and bigger for sure.

163
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,875
It's still young.

164
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,291
Could even evolve into Walrein one day.

165
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,541
I guess I thought Sealeo
would be much better off living here.

166
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,125
Especially if that happens.

167
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,208
I mean, just look at all the space
and freedom it could have to play.

168
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,125
Enough! That's just a selfish excuse!

169
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,208
Tyler.

170
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,666
You always said when I was a kid
to never make any excuses!

171
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,208
But look who's making one.

172
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,708
Please tell me the truth.

173
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,708
Do you really wanna give up Sealeo?

174
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,958
No, I would never wanna do that.

175
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,625
But how? Even if I find a place
that has more space,

176
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,375
I know Sealeo would be
a lot happier outside.

177
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,416
I truly only have Sealeo's best interests
at heart.

178
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,041
Okay.

179
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,791
I get it now. You're right.

180
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,375
Sorry, Ms. Watanabe! I'm begging you!

181
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,250
Please allow Sealeo to stay here.

182
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,875
Tyler.

183
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm sorry. Please, Ms. Watanabe!

184
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,250
You're right! Uncle Dan shouldn't have
left Sealeo here without telling us!

185
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,375
But that's not Sealeo's fault.

186
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,458
Please consider it.

187
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,875
Looking after a Sealeo
is not going to be a piece of cake.

188
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll take responsibility for it, ma'am!

189
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,333
You can't handle more.

190
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,708
I don't want you to neglect
your work schedule.

191
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,583
Your responsibilities
are that of a concierge first.

192
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,125
I can help Tyler watch Sealeo.

193
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,458
Give us a chance. It won't be a problem
if we just work together!

194
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,958
Alisa.

195
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,041
Haru, please tell me what you think.

196
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,625
Me? I uh…

197
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,208
I can help too.

198
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,500
However,
I dunno if it's the right thing to do.

199
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,125
I don't…

200
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,458
To be separated from Dan like that…

201
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,958
Haru.

202
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,791
Having Sealeo stay
while Dan has to go back home,

203
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,916
would that be okay?

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,458
Is that really the best option
we can come up with?

205
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
Would they both be happy?

206
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,708
You're right.

207
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,125
Would Sealeo and Dan
want to live like that?

208
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,333
Very well, then.

209
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,041
Sealeo can stay here
at the Pokémon Resort.

210
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,166
I've seen how well it gets along
with the other Pokémon staying here.

211
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,291
They find it quite entertaining
and friendly.

212
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,375
Really? Thank you very much!

213
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,791
It can stay only on one condition.

214
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,416
Right. Yes, I'll do whatever you want.

215
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,125
Well, Dan…

216
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,041
Would you like to possibly work here?

217
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,916
You can work here and spend
as much time as you want with Sealeo.

218
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,375
But hold on a minute…

219
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,541
How can I work here after all of the
horrible things I put you all through?

220
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,541
Yes, it's true. What you did
was unacceptable.

221
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,583
However,
you did what you thought was right,

222
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,791
because you love your Pokémon
unconditionally.

223
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,583
It seems to me
that your personality is very suitable

224
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,666
for working with all the Pokémon here.

225
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,541
What a neat trick, Sealeo!

226
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,708
Look at you go!

227
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,166
Sorry. Sorry, my friend.

228
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,208
Ms. Watanabe, I can't thank you enough.

229
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,208
-Ms. Watanabe.
-Ms. Watanabe!

230
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,791
You're the best ever!

231
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,541
Everyone!

232
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,041
I'm looking forward to working here!

233
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,625
Yo! Let's go out and play!

234
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,958
For Sealeo!

235
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,458
Show 'em how it's done!

236
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:35,083
