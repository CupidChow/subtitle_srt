1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,375
It'll take some getting used to
but once you can master balancing,

2
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,458
it'll be a piece o' cake!
I believe in you!

3
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,708
Balance. Okay. Sure thing.

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,708
Making a turn can be tricky because
you have to slightly lean to the side

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,125
where you're going to be turning.

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,458
I see.

7
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,125
With a little bit of practice,
you should be good to go!

8
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:38,291
I get it. It's kinda like steering a boat.

9
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,458
Let's set sail!

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,708
Oh wow! You picked that up really fast!

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,541
Yeah! Because you're
a really great teacher, Haru!

12
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,458
Sealeo! There you are!

13
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,958
Where you goin'?
Hang on! Wait for me, Sealeo!

14
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,916
Wait for me!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,041
Hey! Hold on!
We haven't finished your training yet!

16
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,625
Dan, please come back!
Where are you going?

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,708
Catch!

18
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,708
Whoa! Magikarp, that was so good!

19
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:30,875
When did you teach Magikarp
that super-cool trick, Dan?

20
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,583
It's not a trick, but thank you
so much for your kind words.

21
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:38,458
If you know Magikarp's strengths,
then anyone can teach them things.

22
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,375
Oh no! Why'd ya splash me?
Now my clothes are all wet, Sealeo!

23
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,625
All right, enough!

24
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,458
It's not nice to splash water on Haru.

25
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,666
Sorry, Haru. Sealeo got a bit carried away
in all its excitement.

26
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,125
Something's not right with the water.
I think it's much too cold for Magikarp.

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,208
So maybe we should move them
somewhere else today,

28
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,875
where the temperature is warmer.

29
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,291
-Would that be all right?
-Yes! Of course!

30
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,708
And I'll help you move all of them!

31
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,458
Thank you, but I'm good.

32
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,208
Old friend, take them downstream, yeah?

33
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,750
Thanks, Sealeo!
I knew I could count on you!

34
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,708
No way! He's already got his own team?

35
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,333
Tyler! Hi!

36
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,791
Would you mind possibly taking over
Dan's training for me, pretty please?

37
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,083
You look nervous.

38
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,583
Don't worry about training him.
It's cool if he just watches you work.

39
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't think
I'm experienced enough for training.

40
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,583
So maybe it would be more helpful
if Dan shadowed you instead.

41
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:05,333
Uncle was super scary
a long time ago when I was small.

42
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,750
I dunno if I could handle it. I'd totally
freeze up if he just glared at me.

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,375
Sorry I can't, but I wish you good luck!

44
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,583
Is he really that scary a person?

45
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,333
He'd never get angry at you.
Don't worry! It's gonna be okay.

46
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,750
You'll end up being a pro at this!
Just take care of Uncle Dan for me, Haru!

47
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,750
Haru, what's next?
Ready to move on when you are!

48
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,750
Th-This is so awkward…

49
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,833
Look at that beautiful garden!

50
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,083
Hey, Dan! What's up?

51
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
You're working hard.

52
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,166
So, Haru's the one teaching you
the ropes around here, huh?

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,125
Is it goin' all right?
Has anything exploded yet?

54
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,708
No, not at all.
I'm learning a lot from Haru.

55
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm… just doing my best.

56
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:58,666
Say, while we're here… why don't
we help out with the vegetable garden?

57
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
Sure!

58
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,750
Oh! You're going to help out too?

59
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,333
Great! We really appreciate that!

60
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,666
That's great! You found a berry!

61
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,125
Water! Water! We need water!

62
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,208
Don't start any bonfires today.

63
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,583
It's so windy that
it might get out of hand.

64
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,541
Haru! Are you all right?

65
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,333
Luckily, nothing caught fire
and everything's good.

66
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,666
So sorry. I owe you a big apology.

67
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,750
I was supposed to be helping
to get you acquainted with working here.

68
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,250
But I just keep messing up.

69
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,333
What? You're wonderful!

70
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,375
Psyduck? You okay? What's wrong?

71
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,416
What's wrong with it?
Looks like a headache!

72
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,125
Alisa!

73
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,208
Chopped all the firewood!

74
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,750
No way.

75
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,000
Controlling this Confusion move
is difficult for Psyduck.

76
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,000
Whenever it gets a headache,
I usually take it to a place

77
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,000
where its power can be released safely
and no one gets injured.

78
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,000
If I can't get to Psyduck in time,
then chaos ensues.

79
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,708
Your head hurts?

80
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,416
No, not the berries!

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,000
Haru, nice catch!

82
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,166
Why me?

83
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,500
Man…

84
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:21,291
Psyduck, I really made a mess of things.
What should I do?

85
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,875
I thought I had enough experience
to train someone.

86
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,666
I tried to show my expertise to Dan.

87
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,416
But I guess I'm just
not really cut out to be a teacher.

88
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,541
I'll ask Ms. Watanabe
to assign someone else this afternoon.

89
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,958
It's for the best.

90
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,166
You've gotta be kidding me.

91
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,291
No, seriously. I was really impressed.

92
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,708
Hello? Ms. Watanabe?
Do you have time to talk?

93
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,125
Why hello, dear.

94
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,625
Good timing.
We were just talking about you.

95
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,291
I apologize for causing
so many problems today, Dan.

96
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,000
Nah! I was telling these two
just how helpful you were

97
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,875
while training me today during work.

98
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,916
Wait what? No way!
You saw how bad I was riding the scooters.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,875
We almost had a bad fire.

100
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,791
I was more impressed with how well
you take care of the Pokémon around here.

101
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,041
You really are thoughtful.

102
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,458
It's true. Psyduck is a prime example.

103
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,666
Just look at how much it trusts you.

104
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,250
Well, for sure.

105
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,000
Haru would always get into
some kind of trouble with Psyduck

106
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,083
when she first started working here.

107
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,750
Since then, her confidence has grown,

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,833
and she can tackle this job
like the rest of us.

109
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,250
What?

110
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,208
Alisa are you actually
complimenting my work ethic?

111
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,708
I can't believe how happy I am right now!
I'm so embarrassed!

112
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,458
On second thought, I take it back.

113
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,375
Even though I'm not used to the way
you work, I swear I'll do my best.

114
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,833
Thank you for being
such an excellent role model.

115
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,458
R-Role model?

116
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,541
Haru, it's all up to you!
Make our team proud!

117
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,291
Good luck training this afternoon.

118
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,541
Yeah… Uh-huh… Thanks…

119
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,416
Okay. I'll make a checklist
of the areas we've seen so far today.

120
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,875
We already took care
of the vegetable garden.

121
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,791
Hey Dan! You ready to rock?

122
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,041
Yo, Dan! Uhh, Dan?

123
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,041
Cheese!

124
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,125
Look at these two!

125
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,833
Here for the photo shoot too, Dedenne?

126
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,708
Hi, Dan.

127
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,958
Please forgive me!

128
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,583
It's so difficult
not to get carried away sometimes.

129
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,875
I took a whole lotta photos
when I first came to this island.

130
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,708
You understand!

131
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,625
Yeah. And since Snorlax
is incredibly rare,

132
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,500
I was so happy to shoot a photo
with Sealeo and Snorlax together.

133
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,750
How adorable is that?

134
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,375
Oh, my! What cuties!

135
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,250
There are so many Pokémon
I need a photo of.

136
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:59,375
Would it be all right to forward
these pictures to my son and his wife?

137
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,541
Yes, but I should tell you…

138
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,958
They should be coming
to visit me soon, I hope.

139
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,041
What's wrong with this phone?
I can't get a signal.

140
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,041
Sorry, the connection
on this island is so bad.

141
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:14,083
When I first came here, I would wander
the whole island to try and get a signal.

142
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,916
Come on. Really? You've gotta be joking.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,125
That's quite a shame.

144
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,458
Someone help! Please help me!

145
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,125
Alisa? Let's check it out!

146
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,208
Right!

147
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,125
Calm down! Knock it off, you two!

148
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,000
What's going on?

149
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,333
They were just messing around,

150
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,750
but things got way too aggressive,
so now they're angry.

151
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,833
-No way!
-No way!

152
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,125
Sealeo! Are you all right?

153
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,958
Oh no!

154
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,958
Knock it off!

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,083
Stop it right now!

156
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,166
Now! Apologize and make up!

157
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,833
It's true, then.
Dan can actually be super scary.

158
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,833
That was so awesome…

159
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,166
Sorry. I haven't scolded anyone
that way since I was younger,

160
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,666
but I really hope I was able to help.

161
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,833
Yeah. It was incredibly helpful.

162
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,916
It's just that…

163
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,500
Because it was so unexpected,
I think everyone is terrified of you now.

164
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,000
Forgive me. I didn't mean to scare anyone.

165
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,250
Okay!

166
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,083
How 'bout some good old-fashioned
playtime to ease the tension?

167
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,250
Gather 'round everyone! Feast your eyes

168
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,250
on the amazing talents
of our good friends, Dan and Sealeo!

169
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,750
Okay, let's put on a good show today!
Go for it!

170
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,000
Excellent job, Sealeo! Well done!

'Kay! Let's show 'em
our own awesome moves!

172
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,125
Psyduck, are you ready to go?

173
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,541
And up!

174
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,041
How come it didn't work?

175
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:59,250
Hey, Dan! Could you give us
another demonstration?

176
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,416
Sure.

177
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,916
Go get it!

178
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,958
Wow! Amazing!

179
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,625
Do you wanna try, Eevee?

180
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,125
Okay!

181
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,333
-Nice job! You're a pro!
-You got it! Good work! Well done!

182
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,250
Yeah, no way could I have
handled that any better.

183
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,458
Ms. Watanabe… I think I know the reason
why you gave this assignment to Haru.

184
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,333
Haru has her own special skills.
