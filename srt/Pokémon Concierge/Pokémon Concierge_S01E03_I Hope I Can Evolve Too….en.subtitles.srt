1
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,791
I've got to get up.

2
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,791
I've got to wake up, put makeup on,

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,208
get into my suit, eat some breakfast,
check my messages…

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,625
Wait! No, I don't!

5
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:47,500
Is it really true?

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,208
My commute from door-to-door
is only seconds!

7
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,333
Plus, I can wear whatever.
No heels necessary!

8
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,500
And no email to check in the morning!

9
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,833
Time to get up, sleepyhead!

10
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,458
It's strange, isn't it?

11
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,708
When I can sleep as late as I want,
I wake up early.

12
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:30,041
Now, let's have another fun day at work!

13
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,000
Ah, it's so nice outside.

14
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,000
I wonder which Pokémon we'll meet today!

15
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:42,833
Mudkip?

16
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,000
What are you looking at?

17
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,916
Alisa?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,166
Just doing some morning rock climbing?

19
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,166
Isn't that Graveler?

20
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,750
Hey! You're supposed to go home today.

21
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,875
Your Trainer is waiting for you!

22
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:15,666
Don't be so selfish,
making trouble for your Trainer.

23
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,166
We'll always be here,
so come again anytime.

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,208
Mudkip,
show it the way to the harbor, 'kay?

25
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,333
See ya, Graveler!

26
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,416
Bye! See you soon!

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,666
So, Alisa, you're also a rock climber?

28
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,666
I did it when I was in junior high.

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,416
But it would be dangerous for you,
so maybe don't try it.

30
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,458
The number of things
you can do is amazing!

31
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,500
All I'm good at is making mistakes.

32
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,166
Instead of focusing on the bad,

33
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,000
a better idea is to figure out
what you're good at.

34
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,166
Pidgeot is way faster
in the air than on the ground.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,250
Graveler picks up
more speed rolling than walking.

36
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,208
Humans are just like Pokémon.

37
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,500
What?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,166
Did we have a Skiploom staying with us?

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,083
Looks like Hoppip evolved yesterday.

40
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,833
Their Trainer said
it would probably happen soon.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Lucky you.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,375
I want to evolve, too, right now.

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,208
I love the water,
but I was never any good at swimming.

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,958
I'm a slow runner, and I never really
got the hang of cooking.

45
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,208
Is making charts and
presentation graphics even a talent?

46
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,291
You're a Water type, aren't you, Psyduck?

47
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,375
And that makes you
good at swimming, right?

48
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,791
That Magikarp has a mark
that looks like a star!

49
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,416
That's so cute!

50
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,541
But a swim ring?

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,958
Even though they're a Magikarp?

52
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,541
That Magikarp is a regular
who's been coming here forever.

53
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,625
They don't swim very well…
just kind of sinks.

54
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:15,958
So we loan them a swim ring!

55
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,958
But even though they can't swim,
they're still having fun.

56
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,458
-Works for you, too, right?
-Huh?

57
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,500
Instead of finding something
that you're good at,

58
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,541
try finding what you think is really fun!

59
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,541
That makes sense.

60
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,291
Still, that might make you
turn out just like me.

61
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,416
You mean refreshing,
but completely free of humility?

62
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:45,708
Psyduck?!

63
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,291
Oh? Psychic power.

64
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:56,708
The swim ring…

65
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,708
It's okay. Don't cry, Magikarp.
I'll go get the swim ring back.

66
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,875
Please take care of our guest!

67
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,041
Psyduck, let's go!

68
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,375
I wonder where they went.

69
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,000
Dragonite!

70
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,958
Wow! Hey, Psyduck! Isn't this cool?

71
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,541
Dragonite! Over there!

72
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,708
Wingull, wait up!

73
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,625
Could you land so I can get that off you?

74
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,458
Psyduck, just a little more!

75
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,458
Hang in there!

76
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,125
So amazing!

77
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,416
Over there!

78
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,000
No, Snorlax, hold on!

79
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,375
You've got to be kidding me.

80
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
Thank you, Lampent.

81
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,625
The concierges all take turns
staying the night in the forest area.

82
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,375
Apparently, every now and then,
a wild Pokémon will get rambunctious.

83
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,958
It's all right.
That doesn't seem to be happening tonight.

84
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,208
I don't know
what I'm going to say to Magikarp.

85
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,833
They'll be so disappointed.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,125
Right! I'll do what I can to fix it!

87
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,166
After all, it's going to be a long night.

88
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,125
Thank you!

89
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,416
But these won't fix the holes.

90
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,208
Okay! Since we have these,
we'll at least make it look good!

91
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,375
And it's done!

92
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,458
I wonder if
Magikarp will like this bouquet.

93
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,125
What's that?

94
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,875
It's Gyarados…

95
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,125
That star marking!

96
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,291
Does that mean…? Could it be…?

97
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,666
Anyway, here's your swim ring…?

98
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,916
Looks like you don't need it.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
You evolved, after all.

100
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,541
If you work hard,

101
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,625
you just might suddenly evolve.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,916
It's bedtime!

103
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,375
Maybe I can evolve into Gyarados, too.

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,250
Huh? They're using it to play!

105
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,458
Wooper!

106
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,416
Do you want a flower swim ring
to play with, too?

107
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,416
Okay, then, let's make them for everybody!

108
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,000
It's good to see you having fun.

109
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,416
Yeah!

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,916
I'm glad you found it. Your talent.

111
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,708
Looks like I have some more work to do.
