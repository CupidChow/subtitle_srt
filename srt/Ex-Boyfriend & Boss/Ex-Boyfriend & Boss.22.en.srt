1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:09,536
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:10,954
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm done here.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,279
I'll go to bed.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,800
You sleep in my bedroom.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,640
I just changed the bedding today.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,000
What about you?

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,679
The sofa.

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,199
I'll feel so guilty about that.

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,000
Then

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,399
together?

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,440
Good night.

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,520
(Zhou Zhengyi, the head
of Changtian's Production Department,)

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,159
(is suspected of disturbing
the social order)

15
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,799
(by using non-compliant products)

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,719
(and engaging in vicious competition.)

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
(He's now taken away for investigation
by the regulatory authority.)

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,679
Nian, time for breakfast.

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,679
Coming.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,159
(Miss Pei Ruolin,)

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,159
(can you say something?)

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Zhou Zhengyi has finally been punished.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
Evildoers will eventually
reap what they sow.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
(Our company will certainly)

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,000
(make a thorough investigation.)

26
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,799
(News)
(We'll provide consolation)

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,979
(Executive Exposed for Sexual Assault)
(for the involved female employees.)

28
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,480
(For this reason, our company has set up
a psychological counseling office)

29
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,599
(and a Women's Federation)

30
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,879
(to ensure that such a thing
does not happen again.)

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,719
Nian,

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,120
focus on your meal.

33
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,799
I seem to haven't brushed my teeth yet.

34
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,359
I'll go do it.

35
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,200
Why are you using my toothbrush?

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Just kidding.

37
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,400
But the cup really is mine.

38
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,280
Yuncheng,

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,960
the board has already decided
to dismiss Zhou Zhengyi.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,719
But as for Tong Nian, this matter

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,439
has made such a fuss within the company.

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,879
Do you think...?

43
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,039
Just be blunt.

44
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,360
You'd better kick Tong Nian
out of the Huagang project team.

45
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,759
Those old board members

46
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,000
already have a problem with you.

47
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm afraid they'll take the opportunity
to sling mud at you.

48
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,800
After all, you've put
so much into this project.

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,759
I'm worried you'll be implicated.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm the project leader.

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,840
I know what to do.

52
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:51,960
Yuncheng,

53
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,840
I believe you'll prioritize
the overall situation.

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,879
Tong Nian, what are you doing here?

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,159
Here for Liao? Just go in.

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,319
I'm just passing by.

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,280
I still have work to do. I'll be going.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,759
Tong Nian,

59
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,719
it's good that you heard it.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
If you are smart,

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,039
you should back out.

62
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,280
What do you mean, "back out"?

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,319
Back out from where?

64
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,919
Chief Assistant Pei,

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,639
aren't you being too meddlesome?

66
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,599
Forget it. Let's go.

67
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,199
Let's leave.

68
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,159
Go.

69
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,439
Go.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,560
Nian.

71
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,240
Mr. Liao, this is the latest bay design

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,520
for the Huagang project.
Please review it.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,080
Don't take what Pei Ruolin said

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
just now to heart.

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,520
Don't worry.

76
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,639
I won't take

77
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,960
the princess's words to heart.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,199
But she is quite right about one thing.

79
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,400
The Huagang project
is very important to everyone.

80
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,159
But if my behavior

81
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
affects the whole project team,

82
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,840
I can quit.

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,479
There isn't anyone in the company

84
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,719
who can fire my team members

85
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,879
without my permission,

86
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,759
nor does anyone have
the right to stop my project.

87
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,719
Are you questioning my ability?

88
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,399
Never, I have never doubted you.

89
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
Then rest assured and stay put.

90
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,639
In my project team,
only performance matters.

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,600
Okay.

92
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,439
Nian,

93
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,000
what on earth happened?

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,680
You called me back in such a hurry

95
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,600
and sent a bunch of desperate emojis.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's talk.

97
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,720
I am wondering if I did something wrong.

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
Did Liao Yuncheng annoy you?

99
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,399
I'll talk to him.

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
No.

101
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,120
It's not him.

102
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,040
It's my own problem.

103
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,920
What's wrong with you?

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,519
It's work-related.

105
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,680
Liao Yuncheng is being targeted
by the board because of me.

106
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,279
Even the project
we are working on together

107
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,199
might be suspended because of me.

108
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,000
So I am wondering

109
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,199
if I should distance myself from him.

110
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,680
Nian, let me ask you.

111
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,279
Did Liao Yuncheng take out

112
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,759
his anger on you
because of these things?

113
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,000
No, he comforted me.

114
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,519
That's right.

115
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,279
The person you're worried about

116
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,399
cares more about how you feel.

117
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,920
So why are you being dramatic?

118
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,759
I'm not being dramatic.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
It's just...

120
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,839
Nian,

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,519
it's time to let go
of your worthless pride.

122
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,759
You always say
you don't care what others think,

123
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,639
but in reality, you care
more than anyone.

124
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:56,360
Do you think so too?

125
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,199
Take your breakup

126
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,639
with Liao Yuncheng for example.

127
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:02,720
Back then, he just said
that he wanted to go abroad,

128
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,079
and you resolutely broke up with him

129
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,480
without letting him explain.

130
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,079
What were you afraid of?

131
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,480
Weren't you just afraid
that he'd choose to go abroad

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,240
and give you up,

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
and you'd lose face?

134
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,720
No, I was not.

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
I was worried about holding him up.

136
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,560
Fine.

137
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
And once,

138
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,040
you waited for Liao Yuncheng
at the laboratory door.

139
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,160
Just because the girls in his class said

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,319
Liao Yuncheng cared
more about experiments

141
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,240
than about you,

142
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,519
you took all your anger out on him.

143
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,879
It was also for his own good?

144
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
What they said wasn't wrong.

145
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,879
How can a man make a girl wait so long?

146
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,759
We're not children anymore.

147
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
We can't be self-willed anymore.

148
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,680
I am your friend,

149
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,079
so I support any decision

150
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,639
you make unconditionally.

151
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,120
But

152
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,319
I can't watch you

153
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,199
making the same mistakes
time and time again

154
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,639
and missing out on the man
who truly loves you.
