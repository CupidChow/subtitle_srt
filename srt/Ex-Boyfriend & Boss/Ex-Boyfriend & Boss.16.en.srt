2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,944
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,919
Here, let's drink.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,080
You got it.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,160
Come closer.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,879
Let's take a picture together.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,160
Smile.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,120
Three.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,280
Two.

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,440
One.

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,879
Cheese.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,359
I wonder

13
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,600
when he'll be back.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,960
Let's just wish him all the best.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
Nian. Look.

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,840
Someone's here to pick you up.
Guess I'll see you.

17
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:47,640
Bye.

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,000
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,600
I've got a joke for you.

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,159
Sure.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,439
Why did the bird sit on the computer?

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,560
Because it wanted

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,480
to keep an eye on the mouse.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,640
That's so funny.

25
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:10,799
Were you guys

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,599
at Hu's farewell party?

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Qianjun is Hu's baby.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,519
Seeing it in this state today,

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
he must be heartbroken.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
That's how corporate world works.

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,560
What about you?

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
When did you decide

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,040
to buy out our company?

34
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,920
It was during that business trip

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,120
when you came to see me.

36
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:31,840
But why?

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,519
The whole acquisition is a win-win.

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,359
Qianjun was already

39
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,400
running low on funds.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,719
It's funny

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
that Hu mentioned you

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,599
last time we talked.

43
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,519
What did he say about me?

44
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,079
Hu said you have so much potential,

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,359
and can make a difference.

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,239
Yeah, that's him.

47
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
When I first joined the company,

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,439
he joked that I did nothing but eat.

49
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,200
Loyalty is gold

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,079
in the workplace.

51
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,319
It's a shame

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,040
Hu couldn't hold onto his own ground.

53
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,280
Qianjun still got you.

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,199
You are right.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,039
Let's see what gift Hu gave.

56
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,039
It's a medal.

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Let's make a video.

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
Hi there, Hu.

59
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:31,120
Bet you're up in the clouds by now.

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,599
Best of luck with winning her over.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,840
Guess what?

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,919
I've got my own mission now.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,599
Don't worry. Qianjun still got me.

64
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,639
I will not

65
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,960
leave Qianjun behind.
Can't wait for you to come back.

66
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,639
Done. Let's go.

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,919
Okay.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Mr. Zhang, I got this.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
I'll find a solution for that batch.

70
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,680
Babe,

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
you look so beautiful today.

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,159
Here. Your favorite.

73
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,680
Thank you.
I like it because it's from you.

74
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,400
Dinner plans?

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
It's up to you.

76
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Hello.

77
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,639
Hello.

78
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,199
You're from Qianjun, right?

79
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,639
You probably don't know me.

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm Zhou Zhengyi,

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,680
head of Production Department.

82
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,759
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhou.
I'm Tong Nian.

83
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,120
Neon dreams,

84
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,959
echoes gleam.

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,639
You got a nice name.

86
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,560
Sounds very poetic.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,759
It suits you.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,120
Thanks.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,240
I saw you taking pictures there.

90
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,600
Are they any good?

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,439
Could you show me?

92
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,839
Whoever you saw, that wasn't me.

93
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,240
I was having breakfast.

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,120
Can't take a picture
with both hands full.

95
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,399
Just show me.

96
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,800
Tong Nian.

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,160
Mr. Chen is asking for you. Go.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,360
Tong Nian.

99
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,959
Sha.

100
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,720
Tong Nian, steer clear of Mr. Zhou.

101
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,680
But...

102
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,079
Why?

103
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,040
Just listen to me.

104
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,879
Stay away from him.

105
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,560
Okay.

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,560
Okay, okay, okay.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
What's wrong? Are you alright?

108
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm fine, Tong Nian.

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,079
I need to head home for a bit.

110
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,279
Mind asking for a leave for me?

111
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,720
Of course not. Sure.

112
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,519
(Email - Non-Conforming Batch)
(This batch)

113
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,079
(of goods are being discarded)

114
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,160
(due to a design issue)

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,120
(from Qianjun Technology.)

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Come in.

117
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,839
Tong Nian. Can I help you?

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,800
Mr. Zhou,

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
quick thing I need to clear up.

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
Did you tell them

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,279
to reject that batch of defective goods?

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
Oh, that one.

123
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,639
Yes, I did.

124
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,680
The batch from Qianjun was defective.

125
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,759
Goods like that

126
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,839
had to be scrapped.

127
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,519
Mr. Zhou, just so you know,

128
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,279
I worked for Qianjun.

129
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,759
I can vouch for Qianjun's products.

130
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,680
They're solid.

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,399
And that batch wasn't even from Qianjun.

132
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,240
Do you have evidence?
