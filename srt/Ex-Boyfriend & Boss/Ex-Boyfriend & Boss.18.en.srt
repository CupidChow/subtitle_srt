00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:09,472
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,944
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,239
Bad luck.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:19,760
Bad luck.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,719
Nian, hurry up and come out.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,079
It's been two hours.
What are you doing in there?

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:26,640
I need to use the bathroom.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,600
I'm coming out.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,839
Nian, quickly.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,399
Quickly.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:36,880
Are you okay?

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,159
I'm fine.

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,719
Qiufen,

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,000
tell me why some people,
despite their ages,

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,719
still think about harassing young girls.

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,159
Some people
are just disrespectful as they age.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,920
A good beating would make him behave.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,439
Be good.

19
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:42,656
(Humph!)

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,239
Nian,

21
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,560
are you okay?

22
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,719
Why did you call?

23
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,359
You said before,

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,519
when a girl says it's nothing,
there's something.

25
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,120
Nian,

26
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,159
are you scared?

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,319
All right,

28
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,759
I'll accompany you while I work.

29
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,400
I heard that the sound of
typing on a keyboard aids sleep.

30
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,560
(Production Department
needs a secretary.)

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,599
(If you handle this well,
the position is yours.)

32
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,400
Tong Nian,

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,719
Zhou,

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,199
here is a batch of purchase orders
from sleeper suppliers.

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,879
One of you checks and signs,

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,280
and the other delivers to the suppliers.

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,479
Make sure they deliver on time.

38
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,159
Be careful and don't make mistakes.

39
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,439
Okay, Mr. Chen.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,039
Mr. Chen,

41
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,719
don't you trust me to handle things?

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,879
Okay, you guys go ahead.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Okay.

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,159
Thanks for checking this.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,879
Not at all.

46
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,439
The data is 128.

47
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,120
That's all?

48
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,159
That's all.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,159
Thanks for signing here.

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Not at all.

51
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,914
(Tong Nian)

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Thank you. I'll go deliver it now.

53
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,479
Okay.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,159
Took the wrong pills?

55
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,919
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

56
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,439
Who's in charge here?

57
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:40,800
She is.

58
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,479
I am.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,800
Help me sign it.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,159
I have other deliveries to make.

61
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Please hurry.

62
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,719
We only ordered 128.

63
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,159
Why are you delivering so much?

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
128?

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Are you kidding me?

66
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
This order clearly states

67
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,159
128 cubic meters.

68
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,120
(Receiving Order)
This was after we rushed with insufficient inventory.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,840
Come on, quickly.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,639
Let me confirm it first.

71
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,439
Please wait a moment.

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,919
Go ahead.

73
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,240
No, give me the order back.

74
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,400
Wait a moment.

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
Don't take the order away.

76
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
Please wait, right away.

77
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,199
My goodness!

78
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,319
Mr. Chen.

79
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,160
What's wrong?

80
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,360
I made a mistake.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
I only wrote the quantity
on the purchase order.

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,040
I didn't write the unit.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,160
What?

84
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,079
In the company's system,

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,399
items without a specified unit,

86
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,040
default to cubic meters.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,000
Zhou,

88
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,759
how should this order proceed?

89
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,480
This...

90
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,720
Mr. Chen, you can't blame me for this.

91
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,160
Tong Nian didn't specify
the unit when placing the order.

92
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,600
I...

93
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,319
I could only fill it in
with the default unit.

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
Mr. Chen, please help Tong Nian out.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,360
I believe she didn't do it on purpose.

96
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
It was just
a bit of carelessness at work.

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,319
Mr. Chen, how much
does this batch of goods cost?

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,079
I'll compensate.

99
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,360
This batch of goods
must be worth around 400,000 yuan.

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,079
How many years will it take for you to
pay this off without eating or drinking?

101
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,600
Tong Nian,
you don't need to worry too much.

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,240
Take care of the work at hand first.

103
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
I'll go handle this matter.

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,240
Alright,

105
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,199
I don't want to hear
others comforting me anymore.

106
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,199
It was indeed my mistake.

107
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,560
It would be better
if you just scolded me.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,639
Who said I wanted to comfort you?

109
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,759
The company's
disciplinary decision is out.

110
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,120
Not paying attention to the units
when placing a purchase order

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
is a basic error.

112
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,639
Now the company's executives
are all discussing about you,

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
and all the staff of Qianjun

114
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,519
being up to the job at Changtian or not.

115
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,279
Well, it was my own fault.

116
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,079
Why involve others in this?

117
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
I can leave if necessary.

118
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,920
Then who will bear the company's losses?

119
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,279
Why silent now?

120
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,720
What's the matter? You're crying?

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
No.

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,560
No crying after being wrong.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,279
The sleepers in the workshop
are replaced twice a year.

124
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,000
24 at a time.

125
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:17,759
That's something everyone knows.

126
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,759
Why didn't
the supplier suspect anything?

127
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,199
Even without confirmation
with the leaders.

128
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,439
Are you implying
that I've been manipulated?
