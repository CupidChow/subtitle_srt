=Episode 14=

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,039
Liao Yuncheng.

4
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,079
Liao Yuncheng.

5
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:38,799
Yuncheng.

6
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,840
Y-Y-You've drunk too much.

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,759
I'll get you a chauffeur.

8
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,399
Take me home.

9
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,239
Liao Yuncheng.

10
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,439
I'm going to take a shower.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Want to eat?

12
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,639
I'm full.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Isn't this the ritual that girls have
when watching TV series?

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,120
You didn't know these things before.

15
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,439
I was naive before.

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,639
Fortunately, I've learned some now.

17
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm telling you. These soap operas

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
are really bad for the youth.

19
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,759
Imagine someone not focusing on
their work to earn money,

20
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,680
but wasting time on dating.

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,360
So,

22
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,840
you're going to have
several more rounds of blind dates?

23
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,439
When did I go on blind dates?

24
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,879
You mean Bai Yang?

25
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,280
No, he is just my buddy.

26
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,159
So now between buddies,

27
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,680
can there be such an intimate behavior?

28
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,840
What behavior?

29
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,759
You misunderstood. I didn't.

30
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,280
So you two...

31
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Liao Yuncheng,

32
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,479
I think we need to make it clear.

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,479
Wait for me a moment.

34
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,319
What is this?

35
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
A love-forgetting potion.

36
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,560
You added sesame oil to it?

37
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,639
It may be a bit too much.

38
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,439
Anyway, it should be sour,
sweet, bitter, spicy and salty.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,319
Anyway, after we drink this,

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,439
we will start over.

41
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,079
Start over?

42
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,680
Start over from when?

43
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,079
As a couple

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,120
or like we never knew each other?

45
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,800
The latter one.

46
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,839
Is the dosage

47
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,240
based on height and weight

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,199
or our feelings?

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Based on the degree of hand tremble.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I drank it first.

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,480
Alright.

52
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,800
Now we are good colleagues
and comrades in arms.

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,199
I hope we'll get along well.

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,959
Who are you?

55
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,360
Bro,

56
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,639
this is a love-forgetting potion,
not an idiot potion.

57
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,079
So what exactly does this potion do?

58
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,079
So we know each other now,

59
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
but we haven't dated.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,639
Is that what you mean?

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
This serious?

62
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,800
Almost.

63
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,480
So I now have the right
to pursue you again.

64
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,480
Except we get back together,

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
anything goes.

66
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,879
Very good.

67
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,360
Very much like the Tong Nian I know.

68
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,519
Miss Tong Nian,

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
could you please be my girlfriend?
