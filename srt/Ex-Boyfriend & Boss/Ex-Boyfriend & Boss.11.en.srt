=Episode 11=

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,599
Secretary Li, Chief Assistant Pei.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,320
List the tech team members

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,000
who will get married
in the second half of the year.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,719
The company is considering organizing
a collective wedding for them.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,800
Okay.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,600
Shall I include you?

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,760
Who told you I am getting married?

10
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,359
Everyone says so.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,519
Was my question not clear enough?

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,359
I'm asking who it was.

13
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,459
Transfer yourself back
to the secretariat tomorrow.

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,039
Get someone
who's not interested in my private life.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,119
Yuncheng, you can't blame it on Li.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,479
Making numerous mistakes at work

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,240
but very curious
about your leader's private life.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,159
I don't want to hear
such ridiculous rumors anymore.

19
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,159
Rumors are normal in a company.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,520
You don't have to make such a big fuss.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,039
You think I'm making a big fuss?

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
Rumors have now spread
throughout the company.

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,119
If this goes on like this,

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,439
it will affect the interests and image

25
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,079
of our group.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,640
I hope the rumors stop here.

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,640
Furthermore,

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,599
anyone can misunderstand
that you are my fiancee,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
but you can't.

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,719
Hello, everyone.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,599
First of all, welcome
to the after-sales service department.

32
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,760
I am the head.

33
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,959
My name is Chen Sixing.

34
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,879
This is Wu Shasha.

35
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,680
New members

36
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
can follow Shasha

37
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,239
to take a tour of the office.

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,519
Please follow me, everyone.

39
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:53,824
(Liao Yuncheng: Why is it hard
for traditional businesses to stay afloat?)

40
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,159
I'm done for.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,680
Hello.

42
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,960
I'm downstairs at your place.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,599
Seems the new job
isn't busy enough for you.

44
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,639
I'll ask Mr. Chen
to increase your workload.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,599
You know I've been assigned
to the after-sales service department?

46
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,199
Mr. Chen has strong business skills.

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,879
You should learn from him.

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,719
Alright, Mr. Liao.

49
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,599
Do you have any other instructions?

50
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,520
No instructions,

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,560
but I have a question for you.

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,719
What is it?

53
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,080
Now that we are colleagues now,

54
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,759
when will you unblock me?

55
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,159
You were the one who blocked me first.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,599
Hello, Mr. Liao.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:15,960
Hello?

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,360
So back then,

59
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,400
it was me who blocked him first?

60
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,840
I scolded him wrongly?

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Nian.

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,479
You're back.

63
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,159
What are you doing?

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,759
Our leader just called me for something.

65
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,680
Your leader?

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Sit.

67
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:45,400
A bald old man
in his forties or fifties?

68
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,719
Listen. You have to be careful.

69
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,759
Men like this

70
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,520
love to harass young girls the most.

71
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,159
Got it.

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Just like this.

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you hiding? Let me see.

74
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,360
You keep this?

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,639
Don't tell me you want
to get back together with him.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,719
You've forgotten
what you said back in the day?

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,280
You're overthinking it.

78
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,479
We're not getting back together.

79
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,840
We are just getting
to know each other again.

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,000
Getting to know each other again?

81
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,759
I don't believe you at all.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,759
You must be tired after a day's work.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Let me give you a massage.

84
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,720
How's that?

85
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,920
So good.

86
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,279
Research data shows

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,439
that 26.5 percent of people think

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,560
in 2021,

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,519
the sales growth rate of air compressors

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
dedicated to laser cutting
was unchanged.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,120
But people who think
that sales increased

92
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,000
account for 36.8 percent.

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,879
Among those,

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,920
11.5 percent of people think

95
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,040
the increase was within 5 percent,

96
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,879
and 17.3 percent of people think

97
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,240
the increase was more than 5 percent

98
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,959
but less than 10 percent.

99
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,639
Additionally, 35 percent
of people believe

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
the increase was greater
than 10 percent.

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,279
Therefore, we can conclude

102
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,399
the sales growth
of last year's air compressors

103
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,720
dedicated to laser cutting
was about 10 percent

104
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,000
to 15 percent.

105
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,040
Currently...

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,279
(The rate of couples
getting back together after breaking up)

107
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,279
(is about 82 percent,)

108
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,360
(so it wouldn't be surprising
if you two do.)

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,079
(But big data shows)

110
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,040
(only three percent of them)

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,839
(can make it to the end.)

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
(In other words,)

113
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,160
(97 percent of them
will still break up.)

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,279
In the next few years...

115
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,839
So if we don't get back together,
we won't break up.

116
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,000
What did you say?

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,000
No getting back, no breaking up.

118
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,959
Mr. Chen,

119
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,199
I didn't hear
the percentage clearly just now.

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,439
Could you say it again, please?

121
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,879
(How is the new job going?)

122
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,720
(I'm working hard
to overcome emotional distractions)

123
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,759
(and focus on my career.)

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,720
(What could possibly distract you?)

125
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
(Never mind. It's all mundane matters.)

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,879
(I'm going back to my reading.)

127
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,319
(Okay.)

128
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
Tong Nian, I have
a sudden project meeting coming up.

129
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,360
A client from a target company

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,279
needs our after-sales service.

131
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,199
Could you receive them?

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,920
Me?
