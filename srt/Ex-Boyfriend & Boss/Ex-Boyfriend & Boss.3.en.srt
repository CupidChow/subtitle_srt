00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,664
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:10,912
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,359
M-M-Mr. Liao,

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,559
what are you doing here?

5
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,920
I came to get

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,399
additional materials from Mr. Hu.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,719
Mr. Hu is not here.

8
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,159
I see.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,320
Then, I might need to trouble you

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,679
to give me a ride to the airport.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,719
Me?

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,799
Your own driver should take you.

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,759
He drank and can't drive.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,280
You should be able
to drive yourself, right?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,759
I can't drive right now either.

16
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,200
Then I'll have to trouble you.

17
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,920
How is Mrs. Lu?

18
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,640
My mom?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She is doing quite well.

20
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,599
The doctor said if there was
no recurrence for two years,

21
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,680
it meant it was well controlled.

22
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,920
For five years,
it'd be considered cured.

23
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,319
It's been over four years now.

24
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,359
What did you just say?

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,280
Weren't you asking about
my mother's illness?

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,159
So, how is Mrs. Lu's health?

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
You were her student.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,920
You know what kind of person she is.

29
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,319
Work was always her first priority.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,319
She's been devoted to graduating classes
in the past few years.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,719
Later, she had difficulty swallowing.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,280
After going for a check-up,
she found out it was cancer.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,599
Were you scared at the time?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,640
It felt like the sky was falling.

35
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,920
But fortunately, the treatment
went relatively well.

36
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,519
It won't be like this anymore.

37
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,319
I'm back.

38
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,400
Baby, I'm leaving now.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,800
Our company has invested in
a production line

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
of new energy electric buses in Xinqiao.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
Your company's air compressors

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
will be used for it.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
I am going over this time

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,560
to monitor the project's progress

45
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:42,919
and will be back soon.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,319
Okay.

47
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,599
Do you know what I am talking about?

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,479
I am reporting my itinerary to you.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
If you go for so long,
what about the car?

51
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,879
Parking fees here are very expensive.

52
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,199
Over ten yuan per hour.

53
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,159
Or I'll drive to your place.

54
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,080
Your company
or your friend's place works too.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Park at your place.

56
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,400
At my place?

57
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,080
Aren't you my friend?

58
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,199
Yes, I am your friend too.

59
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,960
But what if I get

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
your car scratched or bumped?

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,159
I can't afford it.

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,520
It's okay. The fee I pay for
parking my car at your place

63
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,599
will be at half the standard rate here.

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,199
Don't worry.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,280
I'll protect it
with my life if I have to.

66
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:25,960
Wrong.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,400
You are more important than anything.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,360
I'm really leaving now.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Darling,

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,479
next up, I'll recommend

71
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,800
this earth-tone eyeshadow
that's especially easy to use.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,560
I strongly recommend it.

73
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:55,199
It looks so good. I love it.

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,479
Thanks.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
This makeup looks so simple.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,719
Can you teach some more complex ones?

77
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,319
Everyone suits different makeup styles.

78
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,599
So if you want to go for
a heavy makeup look,

79
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,199
I will share it
with everyone another day.

80
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,800
What eye shadow are you using?

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,599
I want it.

82
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,280
This is it. Hurry and buy it.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,240
Alright.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,959
That's it for my makeup sharing today.

85
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,360
Darling, if you want to chat,

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
we'll see each other later.

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
Bye.

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,240
Nian, why are you back so late today?

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,199
I had to work overtime.

90
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,240
Really? Your boss was exploiting you

91
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,639
even on a Friday?

92
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,519
Qiufen,

93
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
I have something to tell you.

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,920
Go ahead.

95
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I may have fallen for someone.

96
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,240
Who?

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,199
No.

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,959
Wait.

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,519
You answer me first.

100
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,079
Does he have

101
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,759
185 centimeters,

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,959
185 millimeters

103
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,240
and 185 square meters?

104
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,800
Yes, yes.

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,680
I guess so.

106
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,680
No way.

107
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,680
This is developing too fast, isn't it?

108
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
You even know the length.

109
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,959
What are you thinking about?

110
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,199
How come your mind

111
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,639
is always stuffed with nasty thoughts?

112
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,600
He is just

113
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,160
a very ordinary client,

114
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,519
but he parked his car at my place.

115
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
It couldn't be Liao Yuncheng, could it?

116
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,040
Of course not.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,319
Then he's another Liao Yuncheng.

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
Do you know what it means
for a man to leave his car

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,720
in your care?

120
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,319
What does it mean?

121
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,439
Figure it out yourself.

122
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,319
It means...

123
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,360
It means I'm trustworthy.

124
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,199
Nonsense. Think about it.

125
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,759
A car is a man's second home.

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,439
Some men would put a sign

127
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,959
on their car that reads
"Neither car nor woman is for a loan".

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
How could he possibly entrust his car

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,879
to you because you're trustworthy?

130
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,720
There's only one possibility.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,079
He's hitting on you.
