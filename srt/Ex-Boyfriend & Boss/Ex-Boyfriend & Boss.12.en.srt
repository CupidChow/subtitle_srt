3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,720
Mr. Li.

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, Mr. Li.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
This is Tong Nian from our department.

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,719
You can ask her questions,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,719
and she will solve them

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,879
by telling you related information.

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,199
I'll leave you two.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,839
Okay.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,960
Sit.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,120
You're so young.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,679
The younger ones are awe-inspiring.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,879
Let's get straight to the point.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:32,520
Okay.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,359
Our company

17
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,759
needs you to provide
detailed machine specifications

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,039
as well as market research results

19
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,560
and provide us
with suitable air compressors.

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,240
Okay.

21
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,439
I'll find the information
for you to review.

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,600
Sorry about that, Mr. Li.

23
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll look again.

24
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,960
I'll find it real soon.

25
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,119
Mr. Li, please.

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,799
I'm really sorry. Take care.

27
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,239
Mr. Li.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,079
Mr. Liao.

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,959
Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,439
Mr. Li,

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
the answers to your questions

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,640
can be found
on our company's official website.

33
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,879
I know.

34
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,200
You still love to joke around.

35
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,120
I think

36
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,359
it's your job to compare

37
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,660
different air compressor parameters

38
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,120
and prices,

39
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,719
so the staff
in our after-sales department

40
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,159
should not presume
to sort it out for you.

41
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,359
If next time,

42
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,079
you still need
a professional explanation,

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,799
our company will certainly prepare

44
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,920
a Q&A session for you.

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,400
So I hope our oversight

46
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,480
this time won't lead to

47
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
unnecessary trouble.

48
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,159
If you have any further questions,

49
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,879
you can contact
our after-sales department again.

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,359
I'm sure

51
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,200
they will provide you
with a satisfactory response.

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,519
(Since you're in after-sales now,)

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
(you need to learn some knowledge.)

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
(Start from the basic knowledge.)

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,000
(The prerequisite
for the successful sale of a product)

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,719
(is that the customer has
the intention and the ability to pay.)

57
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,240
(Customer intention
is based on customer needs.)

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,759
(Only customers with needs
will inquire about the product,)

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,199
(and a purchase is likely to occur.)

60
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,120
(When facing customers' questions,)

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,120
(the priority)

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,719
(is to get the customer's core needs.)

63
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,642
(Tong Nian: Thank you.)

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,160
Yuncheng,

65
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,279
do you have time

66
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,199
to have late-night snack with me?

67
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,519
Actually, you don't need to treat me

68
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,079
to a meal just to say thanks.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,360
Mr. Liao, you might be overthinking it.

70
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,759
This is

71
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,319
not to thank you for your notes.

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
But today,

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,079
no matter what you want to eat,
from Michelin food to street barbecue,

74
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,959
I'll pay the bill.

75
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,360
So tired.

76
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Are you tired?

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,439
No matter what you want to eat,
from Michelin food to street barbecue,

78
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,439
I'll pay the bill.

79
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,720
What a coincidence.

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,959
Yeah.

81
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,439
Is it a coincidence?

82
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,240
I don't think so.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm so hungry.

84
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,480
My dear colleague Bai Yang,

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,439
could you please wash
the ingredients for me?

86
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,680
My dear colleague Qiufen,

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,879
on the way back just now,

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
my leg

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,959
had an accident alone.

90
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,600
I suggest

91
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,759
you ask your dear bestie

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,639
Tong Nian for help.

93
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
What do you mean?

94
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,720
In cahoots?

95
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,120
Let's make a deal.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,839
Whoever is hungry cooks for us.

97
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Anyway, I won't cook.
