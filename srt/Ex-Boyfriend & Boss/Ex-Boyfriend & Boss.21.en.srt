=Episode 21=

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,919
Qiufen?

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,079
Nian.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Are you okay? What happened?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,320
Come and sit.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,039
Someone pried open the lock on our door

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,399
and cut the power.

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,960
I hid for quite a long time.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,920
I only dared to come out
after hearing you are back.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,159
I'm sorry. I was late.

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,039
I've called the police.

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:40,840
Did you come together?

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,439
I'll tell you later.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,280
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,640
This happened because of me.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,799
How could it be because of you?

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,880
Is it that nasty leader at your company?

19
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,479
I guess it probably is.

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,119
The security here is too poor.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's not live here anymore.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,239
I'm planning to go stay
at my mom's place for a few days.

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,159
What about you?

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,840
I can't let my parents know about this.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
I might have to book a hotel room.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,239
I'll do it for you.

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:18,920
Hello?

28
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,159
Okay.

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,519
Who is it?

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,959
I won't talk to you
about that now, Nian.

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,120
Bai Yang is coming.

32
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,400
I'm going to his place.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,519
I'll leave you in his care then.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm leaving now.

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,280
Wait.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,760
What's going on
between you and Bai Yang?

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,319
I'll tell you later.

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,959
I'm off.

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,760
Be careful.

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,439
Got it.

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
You're hurt?

42
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,879
I-It seems
I didn't bandage it very well.

43
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,599
Maybe we should go to see a doctor.

44
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,759
It's okay. It's not that serious.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Are you really okay?

46
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,400
Yes, just take me home.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,120
Okay, I'll call a cab right now.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Take it slow.

49
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,439
Make sure your wound doesn't get wet.

50
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,360
I'll come tomorrow
to change your bandage.

51
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,879
Rest well.

52
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,759
I'll be going then.

53
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,240
Stay here tonight.

54
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,759
Is that okay?

55
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,520
I got hurt while saving you.

56
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,199
You should take responsibility.

57
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll need your help
with the dressing changes.

58
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,159
All right, then.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
I need to change into new clothes now.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I need your help.

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,520
I suppose you won't peek, right?

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,560
Of course not. Rest assured.

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,280
Liao Yuncheng,

64
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,159
maybe you should go back
to your room to change.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,840
What are you doing?

66
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,879
Our company's intranet.

67
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,639
I don't think hiding
like this is a good solution.

68
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,080
After all, we've completely fallen out
with Zhou Zhengyi.

69
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,759
So I want to eliminate him without fail.

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,039
"We"?

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Isn't it?

72
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, "we".

73
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,439
The old folks on the board

74
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,080
don't want to get rid of Zhou Zhengyi.

75
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,639
When I submit the evidence
of his corruption and bribery

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
to the supervisory authority,

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,800
it won't be up to them anymore.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Will that bring Changtian big trouble?

79
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Zhou Zhengyi

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,519
is like a locust
that keeps clinging to Changtian.

81
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,160
If we don't remove it,

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,199
we'll only face greater danger later on.

83
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,040
But I'm worried

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,000
that this will affect
your cooperation with Huagang.

85
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,959
And it's possible that

86
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,279
Pei Ruolin might also

87
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,240
blame this matter on you.

88
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,040
No, if she is a smart person,

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
she should be preparing
the PR draft now.

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,839
Well,

91
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,639
you really know Pei Ruolin so well.

92
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,120
The first time I heard her saying

93
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,439
that she was your fiancee,

94
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,399
I believed it.

95
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
There indeed was a reason for it.

96
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,560
Is this enough
to alleviate your concerns?

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,759
Don't let me get distracted.

98
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm gonna organize the evidence.

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm done here.

100
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,959
I'll go to bed.

101
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,399
You sleep in my bedroom.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
I just changed the bedding today.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
What about you?

104
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,199
The sofa.

105
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,639
I'll feel so guilty about that.

106
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,639
Then

107
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,879
together?
