00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,504
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:11,136
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,759
A love-forgetting potion?

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,120
Tong Nian,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,519
are you three years old?

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,679
Boring.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,920
Me? Boring?

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,519
Here's something spicy.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,320
Not only did he drink it,

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,440
but he also confessed to me again.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,879
Really? Did you say yes?

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,960
I said, "I don't know."

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,479
Today's meeting

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,119
is to discuss

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,560
the design plan for Huagang Bay.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,640
As we know,

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,359
the design plan for Huagang Bay

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,679
is an opportunity for us

19
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,679
as well as a challenge.

20
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,000
Being by the sea

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,439
gives us better chances
to find good offers

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,960
for building a nicer property.

23
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,039
But, keep in mind,

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,640
the coastal environment is quite humid,

25
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,079
so we might face some problems.

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,040
That's it

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,439
for today.

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,400
Any questions?

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,840
No. It's clear.

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,799
The Huagang Bay project

31
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,640
is our big focus
for the next few months.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,200
So,

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,359
I'm rounding up the A-team

34
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,560
from different departments.

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,359
Tong Nian and Sun Jianing
from After-sales Service Department,

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,239
head to the Project Department
to get started.

37
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,319
I'll keep you posted

38
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,519
on any other staff changes.

39
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,799
Thanks for today, everyone.

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,359
Take a break
with coffee and afternoon tea.

41
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,640
- Thanks, Mr. Liao.
- Thanks, Mr. Liao.

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,640
Yuncheng.

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,760
What's the matter?

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,439
Are you free tonight?

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,920
Let's go out for dinner.

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,120
I'd rather keep things work-related,

47
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
you know, professional boundaries.

48
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,519
By the way,

49
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,719
she asked me

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,280
to give you something.

51
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Keep it.

52
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,519
What's the big deal?

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,519
It's just
a little gift exchange between girls.

54
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,439
No need for you to step in.

55
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,120
Better not to give
secondhand items as a gift.

56
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,120
Mr. Liao.

57
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,039
I'm sorry, Mr. Liao.

58
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:26,919
It's fine.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,599
You wanted to see me, Mr. Liao?

60
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,560
You're in the Project Department

61
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,879
because of your capabilities,

62
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,400
not...

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,960
I know that.

64
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,840
I thought you'd refuse.

65
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,639
Why would I?

66
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,599
Being with you...

67
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,520
Getting into your project team

68
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,360
is like a dream come true.

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,639
I can't say no.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,639
A dream, huh?

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Just a heads-up, get ready for

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
some overtime next week.

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,759
Start prepping the initial materials
for the project.

74
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Got it, Mr. Liao.

75
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,719
Finish up today's tasks first,

76
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,879
and we can

77
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,479
polish up the recent work later.

78
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay.

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,599
Back to business.

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,639
Stop looking like

81
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,000
you've never seen
something like that before.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,479
Get up. It's just us now.

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,719
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,360
Nian,

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,840
next time you want to see me,

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
just come to my office.

87
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,120
No need to hit the wall.

88
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,439
I didn't. I...

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Could you grab some tape

90
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,520
with logos on it?

91
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,120
Get the bright-colored ones

92
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,719
and stick them at eye level.

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay, Mr. Liao.

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Nian.

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,319
Nian.

96
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong?

97
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,120
Hu is leaving for abroad tomorrow,

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,240
and there's a farewell party tonight.
Wanna go?

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,879
Oh, I totally forgot about that.

100
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,639
There's still time.

101
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,279
Let's get ready.

102
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm ready.

103
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,800
Let's go.

104
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,040
They're probably busy now, Hu.

105
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,399
Something came up.

106
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah, something came up.

107
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,199
No worries.

108
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,879
Working in a big company
is a hectic gig,

109
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,279
and they need to make a good impression.

110
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,439
I get it.

111
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,160
Today's the last day

112
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,680
at our Qianjun office.

113
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,319
Huge thanks to everyone

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,079
for making time

115
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,759
to be here at the farewell party for me.

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,319
Before I take off,
I wanna give you something to remember.

117
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,519
No need to be polite.

118
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,560
I've got plenty of drinks,

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,079
so drink up.

120
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,680
Let's do it.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,639
Mr. Hu,

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,079
let me take this chance
to thank you properly.

123
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,319
Your mentorship has changed my life.

124
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Without you,

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
I wouldn't be where I am today.

126
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,680
Cheers to that.

127
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,680
Also, thank you so much

128
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,519
for introducing me
to Mr. Zhou from Changtian.

129
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
Mr. Hu, thanks from me too.

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,879
I gotta go. Something came up.

131
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,759
I'll walk her out.

132
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,240
You guys enjoy.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,199
Hey...

134
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,800
Wait...

135
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,439
Seriously, they could've skipped
the whole thing.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
Hey, stop it.

137
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,120
Hu knows what's going on.

138
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,519
Let's not make it worse.

139
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,160
Go easy on the booze at parties.

140
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,680
Be smart and
don't just drink with anybody.

141
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,120
I might have given bad advice.

142
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,439
But make sure

143
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,079
to take this one to heart.
