00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:09,532
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:10,912
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,274
(Partner: Changtian Industry)

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,279
This one won't work, either.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,879
Let's try another one.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,239
How's it?

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,079
Look, the logo is blurry.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,519
And the screenshot
has an unedited grey border.

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,839
We need to book with the printing shop
in advance during the expo.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,159
We only have half an hour.

11
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,880
If we can't get the logo in HD in time,

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,679
we're doomed, Nian.

13
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,240
Half an hour.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,359
You go buy us some time.

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,799
I'll think of another solution

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,359
for the logo.

17
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:48,200
Okay.

18
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:01,376
(Humph!)

19
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,040
(What are you doing, princess?)

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,359
(Don't bother me. Busy.)

21
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,480
(Who upset you, princess?)

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,280
(Changtian Industry.)

23
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,840
What can I do within half an hour?

24
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,920
(Is that company bothering you?)

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,799
(Stupid company.)

26
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,799
(The logo is gold or what?)

27
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,519
(Such a pain.)

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,959
(Couldn't find one without watermark.)

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,799
(Got it. One sec.)

30
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,560
Find me a document
with the logo of Changtian Industry.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
What do you need that for?

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,359
Just find it.

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,640
The Xinqiao project
has been a mess lately.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,040
I've got a hunch
that Zhou is behind it again.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,120
Let's check it out, and we'll know.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,879
We have more urgent things to do
than to do Photoshop.

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,639
You're too curious.

38
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,840
He actually made it.

39
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,520
(Thank you, Gabber.)

40
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,400
(No worries.)

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,360
(Let's grab a meal sometime.)

42
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,120
(Gabber)

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,639
(Why is he video-calling me?)

44
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,159
(What's with the video call?)

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,159
(It's not a good time.)

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
He said he would always have

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,639
the end word in our chat.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Did he fall asleep

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,639
or

50
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,840
is he pissed off?

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
I've got some juicy gossip for you.

52
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,039
What is it?

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,319
Mr. Liao from Changtian Industry

54
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,599
had an accident.

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,840
Liao Yuncheng?

56
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,039
Don't call the boss by name.

57
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,479
What happened to him?

58
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
I heard

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,039
he got himself injured

60
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,680
while looking out
for the construction workers.

61
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,199
Changtian Industry
is keeping this under wraps.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,439
They haven't talked about it.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,479
Can you do me a favor?

64
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,400
I need a day off.

65
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,680
What should I say?

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
I ate something that upset my tummy.

67
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:06,919
You just...

68
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,039
Tong Nian, get me
two cups of coffee on your way back.

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,599
No problem.

70
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,319
That's my key.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,120
Hello, Manager Zhao.

72
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,160
This is Tong Nian.

73
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm wondering
which hospital Mr. Liao is in?

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Alright. Thank you.

75
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,519
Can I help you?

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,839
I'm here representing my company
to visit Mr. Liao.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,079
Which company?

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Qianjun Technology.

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,959
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,040
No one is allowed in

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
without our boss's approval.

82
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,000
Zhao Qiqi asked me to visit.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,839
Don't bother him with work.

84
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,480
So you are Zhao Qiqi's friend.

85
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,639
How did you know Yuncheng?

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,759
I am his junior from college.

87
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
And you are...?

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,279
I am Yuncheng's fiancee, Pei Ruolin.

89
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,199
Nice to meet you.

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
How is he doing?

91
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,360
Yuncheng hasn't woken up yet.

92
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you want to see him?

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,959
No, it's okay.

94
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,319
With you taking care of him,

95
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,839
I'm sure he'll get better soon.

96
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
Of course.

97
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,160
No one knows him better than I do.

98
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,480
I see.

99
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,279
Could you...?

100
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,879
Alright, I'll leave you be.

101
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,160
It's the special VIP section,
not some regular hospital rooms.

102
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,920
Get rid of

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
these cheap flowers and gifts.

104
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,199
I can't believe

105
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,399
you let this kind of stuff in here.

106
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,639
(Gabber, I'm at Xinqiao.)

107
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,600
(Where are you?)

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
Hello, what's up?

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,879
Hurry back, Nian.
Our company is going to be acquired.

110
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,720
We got acquired?
