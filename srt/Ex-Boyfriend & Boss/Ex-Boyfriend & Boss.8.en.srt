00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,134
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:50,624
(Let's break up.)

4
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,519
Awake? I was so worried about you.

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,519
Are you out of your mind?

6
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,840
You know you have a stomach issue.
Stop pushing yourself.

7
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,879
Luckily, your boss got the ticket

8
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,079
for going on the highway,

9
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,159
so he went to Xinqiao to find you.

10
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,480
Otherwise, you'd be in paradise by now.

11
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
Do you know that?

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
You mean

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,480
it was Hu who brought me back?

14
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,920
Who else could it be?

15
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,560
Wait for me here.

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
I'll get you some congee.

17
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,040
Here comes the congee.

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Here, it's a bit hot.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
Drink it slowly.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,879
Did you make this?

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
It's takeout.

22
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,080
That's not true.

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,439
Drink it slowly.

24
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,719
I still have to go to the office
after taking this.

25
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,919
You're like this now
and still going to the office?

26
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,639
I've lost my man.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,680
I have to find a way to keep my job.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
You've got a lot of nerve.

29
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,319
I asked for coffee yesterday.

30
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,000
Where is it now?

31
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,039
I didn't forget.

32
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,439
Here.

33
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,360
Write a 5,000-word self-criticism
to me tomorrow.

34
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,599
Okay.

35
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,639
Never mind. Just skip it.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
No one reads it even if you write it.

37
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,319
Our company is about to be acquired.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,879
Added sugar again.

39
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,199
(Nian, long time no see!)

40
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,439
(I've had some recent issues
and couldn't contact the outside world.)

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,919
(My chat history
was mistakenly deleted.)

42
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,360
(I was unable to reply in time.)

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,599
(Sorry about that.)

44
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,800
(Can we make up?)

45
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:58,867
(Okay, let's make up.)

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Did you set a password for your phone?

47
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't like it
when others mess with my stuff

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,920
without my permission.

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,839
So in your mind,
I'm considered as someone else?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,199
Without others' permission,

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,079
you peek at their information

52
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,920
and even try to delete it.

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,399
Chief Assistant Pei,

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,759
have you forgotten about my profession?

55
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,560
I didn't set a screen lock on my phone,

56
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,120
because I have a way to

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,600
recover all the data inside.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,120
But now,

59
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,399
I don't want the people I care about

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,120
to misunderstand me

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,639
due to your actions.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,480
Mind your own position.

63
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,600
You are talking about Tong Nian?

64
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,079
She's just an employee
sent by the partner company.

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,100
- As for...
- Chief Assistant Pei,

66
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,079
the identity of Tong Nian,

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,759
I don't think it's for you
to define casually.

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,800
Moreover,

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,879
there's no need to make
such a fuss over this minor injury.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,639
How did our company

71
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,920
end up being acquired?

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,920
It was another partner

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,639
who mortgaged
the company's assets for a loan

74
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,519
to speculate in futures.

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,720
Thanks to Mr. Hu's hard work,

76
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,839
our company
became a supplier for Changtian

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,279
and are acquired by them now.

78
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,319
No wonder.

79
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,319
Tong Nian, people
from Changtian Company are here.

80
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,199
Go and receive them.

81
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,680
(Qianjun Technology)

82
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
It's you again.
