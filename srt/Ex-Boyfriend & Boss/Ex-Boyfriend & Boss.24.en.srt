00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,109
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,199
Thanks for your care, Gabber.

4
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,559
Eat it.

5
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,399
Gabber.

6
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,719
Liao Yuncheng, you're really something.

7
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,960
You have got two faces.

8
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,960
Because you

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,119
blocked me on WeChat.

10
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:50,679
Stop.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,560
I don't want your explanation.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,640
No way.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Why not?

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,640
If you don't agree, I'm leaving.

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,280
I'm really leaving.

16
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,959
Fairy Nian,

17
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,200
long time no see.

18
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,640
How come you've lost weight?
Have some fruit.

19
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:35,799
Is it sweet?

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,719
Good boy.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,719
You must remember to be a good man.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,079
Don't flirt with any women.

23
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,959
Considering you're working
so hard washing the fruits,

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,239
I'll reward you.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
That's so much.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,959
How should I spend it?

27
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,040
Spend it as you wish.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,280
I want to spend it with you.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,639
How about...?

30
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,080
No!

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,719
My husband is coming back soon.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
Hurry and hide.

33
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,360
Stay hidden. You mustn't come out.

34
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,759
Tong Nian,

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,000
have you had enough?

36
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,639
Not yet.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,039
Who would've thought the top student
and hunk from Huagang University,

38
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,400
the great Mr. Liao would come to this?

39
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,560
I'll hold it for you.

40
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,240
Your husband will be back soon.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,879
That's too dangerous, isn't it?

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,520
How about

43
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,039
we just

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,080
make it quick?

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
Why did you get up so early?

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
When I came back last night,

47
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,039
I saw the money by the bed.

48
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,479
What good thing did you do
while I was away?

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
Honey,

50
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,319
a friend came over to stay
for a short visit yesterday.

51
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,280
This should be the room charge he left.

52
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,400
Are you sure it's not a service fee?

53
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,479
Of course not. You're overthinking it.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Let's go.

55
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
Nian, time to get going.

56
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,480
I'll change my clothes
and be right there.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,319
I didn't expect you
to look good in my clothes.

58
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,639
Don't you think it's a little small?

59
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,439
Not really.

60
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Okay.

61
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,079
Now that we've changed our clothes,

62
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,360
don't do the experiment.
Let's go out for fun together.

63
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,920
Alright.

64
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,560
Then

65
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,480
I want to go to

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,160
an amusement park.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,759
Okay.

68
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,879
And I also want to eat the egg tarts
you made for me back then.

69
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,319
Okay.

70
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,600
And buy a building.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,040
Okay.

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,480
And play as Gabber
and spend the day with me.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,439
Enough.

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
Do you still remember

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,800
when I first came
to the university to see you?

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,600
I do.

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,439
I remember everything here.

78
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
What's the matter, Nian?

79
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,160
Why haven't you asked me again

80
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,399
about the reason for breaking up?

81
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,959
Because I believe
that no matter the reason,

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,079
it won't hinder us anymore.

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,639
You're always like this,

84
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,000
tolerating my capriciousness
without reason.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,959
Actually, back then,

86
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,720
it was because I heard the talk

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
between you and the dean of students,

88
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,720
so I brought up breaking up with you.

89
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,600
The dean of students?

90
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,279
So you thought I would abandon you?

91
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,399
I thought you were going abroad

92
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,959
and would break up with me.

93
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,199
I didn't want to be dumped,

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,079
so I brought up breaking up first.

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,839
I never admitted defeat,

96
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,040
but I lost to my own pride.

97
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,319
But I only found out later

98
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,600
you didn't go abroad at all.

99
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,160
I regretted it,

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,000
but at that time,

101
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,120
I didn't know how to face you.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,879
And during our silent treatment,

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
I was always the first to give in.

104
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,639
I thought that time

105
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,399
you might back down first,

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,199
but you didn't.

107
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,399
Later on, we graduated.

108
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:56,959
Nian.

109
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Hello.

110
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,120
Mom.

111
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,480
Got it.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm with a friend.

113
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,800
Okay.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,839
Alright.

115
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,519
A friend?

116
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,839
Are you referring to me?

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,680
Who else?

118
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm not your girlfriend?

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Weren't we talking about our breakup?

120
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
That was just now.

121
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,639
You want to go back on your words now?

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,079
Mom.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,879
You heard that, right?

124
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,959
Your future daughter-in-law.

125
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,959
I won't let you go this time.

126
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,319
(This is my ex-boyfriend.)

127
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,439
(My boss.)

128
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,720
(My senior.)

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,160
(My boyfriend.)
