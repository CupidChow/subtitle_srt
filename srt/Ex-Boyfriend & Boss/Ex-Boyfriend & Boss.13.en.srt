2
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:11,186
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,919
My dear colleague Qiufen,

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,399
on the way back just now,

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,160
my leg had an accident alone.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,920
I suggest

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,120
you ask your dear bestie

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,079
Tong Nian for help.

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,519
What do you two mean?

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,039
In cahoots?

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,359
Let's make a deal.

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,119
Whoever is hungry cooks for us.

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,479
Anyway, I won't cook.

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,200
You have a guest.
Shouldn't you cook for him?

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,359
Why should I do it alone?

16
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,479
The three of us are all here.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,079
Fine.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,799
I'll cook, okay?

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,520
You two are so lazy.

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,840
I'll do it.

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,520
Love you.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,319
You are Liao Yuncheng
of Meitian Industry?

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,879
Liao Yuncheng of Changtian Industry.

24
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,680
So it was you who acquired
the company Nian worked for?

25
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,120
So this is what you rely on

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,560
to manipulate Nian?

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,159
Nian?

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,359
Are you very close to her?

29
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,079
Not very much. Just childhood friends.

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,079
Being seen in open-crotch pants

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,159
is not something to be proud of, is it?

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,840
We're all friends. Let's talk friendly.

33
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,319
Bai Yang,

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,640
what's going on with you?

35
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,400
My purpose for coming here today

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,079
is to ask Nian

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,439
if she agrees to be with me.

38
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,359
Since I see
a suspected romantic rival here,

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,480
I must scope him out.

40
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:05,599
Don't misunderstand.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
Tong Nian and I just have
a working relationship.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
Come on, Nian.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
Your favorite meat.

44
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,639
Bai Yang,

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I just realized today you had grown up

46
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,840
and become sensible.

47
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,080
Scientific research indicates

48
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
meat is not easily digested by humans.

49
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,319
No more than 100 grams per day.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,080
That piece of meat is 150 grams.

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Eat vegetables.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,199
Then eat seafood.

53
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
Seafood won't make you fat.

54
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,639
Seafood is high in purines.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,879
Moderate intake
of soy-based foods and vegetables

56
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,319
can effectively balance
the pH of your body.

57
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,319
Eat vegetables.

58
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,199
What's wrong with them?

59
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,599
You didn't see the great tension
between them just now.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,479
Can you leave some meat for me?

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How about

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
we play a game?

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,479
Good idea. What should we play?

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,639
Everyone has played
the King's Game, right?

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,199
The one who draws the king card

66
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,879
can command anyone present
to do anything.

67
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,719
Then let's start dealing the cards now.

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,280
The first king comes out.

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
It's me.

70
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,479
Dong Qiufen, you must have cheated.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,919
You deal the cards next time.

72
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,360
All right. It's what you said.

73
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,800
The one who drew two
and the one who drew three this time

74
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,879
drink cross-cupped wine. How about it?

75
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,360
It's not me.

76
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,000
What's going on?

77
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,319
Dong Qiufen, are you doing this
on purpose to mess with me?

78
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,279
Why would I do that? Hurry up.

79
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's switch seats then.

80
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,959
Here. You deal the cards.

81
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,199
Look.

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,279
I've told you I have good luck.

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,079
The one who drew two
and the one who drew three this time

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
kiss.

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,560
You're getting cold feet?

86
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,800
Just a kiss. Who's afraid?

87
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,279
That's enough, Bai Yang.
Stop messing around.

88
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,839
I...

89
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm the king again.

90
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,920
This time, the one who drew one
and the one who drew two...

91
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,480
Dong Qiufen, you drank too much.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,399
Have some water.

93
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,399
I won't drink. I'm not drunk.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Liao Yuncheng,

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,839
are you okay?
