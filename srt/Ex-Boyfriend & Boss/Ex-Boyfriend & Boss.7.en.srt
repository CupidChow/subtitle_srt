00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,155
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,479
You have tummy troubles, silly.

4
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,479
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Liao Yuncheng.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,399
I regret it.

7
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,879
Can we get back together?

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,239
Yuncheng.

9
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,680
I made these egg tarts

10
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,040
myself.

11
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,760
Want a bite?

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,680
Did you learn it from Mrs. Lu?

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,560
Yes.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
They look pretty good.

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,200
They're like the ones
from that nearby shop.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,680
How did you know I bought them?

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,359
Remove the label next time.

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,319
But honestly,

19
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,719
I love anything you give me.

20
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,000
Alright.

21
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,239
Let's do "Black and White" again.

22
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,599
Let's go.

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,040
Three, two, one.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,760
- Black and white,
- Black and white,

26
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,760
- boys and girls just right.
- boys and girls just right.

27
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,480
No one this time.

28
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,480
Again.

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,920
- Black and white,
- Black and white,

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,840
- boys and girls just right.
- boys and girls just right.

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,960
Tong Nian, you lost again.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,319
It's always you.

33
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,960
Are you guys cheating?

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
We're not.

35
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,520
You can't do Truth anymore,

36
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,080
because I know all your secrets.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
It has to be Dare. Am I right?

38
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,319
Agreed.

39
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,159
- Do the Dare.
- Do the Dare.

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,960
- Dare.
- Dare.

41
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,639
Alright.

42
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,879
What do you want me to do?

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,639
Let me think.

44
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,599
I got one. Confess love
to your Starred friend on WeChat.

45
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:35,560
What about it?

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,919
You're Starred on my WeChat.

47
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,199
Come on.

48
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,199
It's the guy from the Student Council...

49
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,919
Shh, don't say it out loud.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,039
Then do it. Or I'll tell.

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
Tong Nian.

52
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,280
Okay, I'll do it.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,960
Do it now.

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,639
I really don't know what to say.

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
I will do it for you then.

56
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,240
Wait.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
Dong Qiufen, give it back.

58
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,360
Stop her.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,039
Found him.

60
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,439
It's a call.

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,439
Talk to him.

62
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,319
Come on, hold it.

63
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,759
Hello.

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,759
Nian.

65
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,400
Yuncheng.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,080
I like you.

67
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
(Liao Yuncheng)

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
Sorry, I called the wrong one.

69
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,919
Are you playing Truth or Dare?

70
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,240
Are you doing the Truth

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
or Dare?

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,280
Say it.

73
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,400
Say it.

74
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm fine with either. It's up to you.

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,000
What do you mean?

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,439
Tell him,

77
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,080
"it's Truth if you agree,"

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,280
"and it's Dare if you disagree."

79
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:52,919
Go ahead.

80
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,439
Say it.

81
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,159
Come on.

82
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,719
It's Truth if you agree,

83
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,199
and it's Dare

84
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,400
if you disagree.

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,000
Tong Nian.

86
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,800
She's not even on the same level

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,080
as the cool, smart Liao Yuncheng.

88
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,639
No idea how she lucked out.

89
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,919
Exactly.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,959
Sorry.

91
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm late again.

92
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,120
Is doing experiments all you care about?

93
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,279
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

94
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,399
Do I even matter to you?

95
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm here now in front of you.

96
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,399
You're always like this.

97
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,399
Yuncheng,

98
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,439
you're going to Columbia University
next month, right?

99
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,399
Getting a full scholarship offer

100
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,639
is quite something.

101
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,879
I know you've got some matters
to take care.

102
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,480
(He's going abroad?)

103
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,360
(Why didn't he tell me?)

104
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,600
Some things can wait,

105
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,279
but opportunities won't wait

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
for you.

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,319
Thank you for the advice.

108
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,759
I know what to do.

109
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,199
Go home and get ready.
