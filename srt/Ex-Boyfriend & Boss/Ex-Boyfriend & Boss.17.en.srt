00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,472
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,976
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,960
I checked that batch of goods.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,199
The end face of
Qianjun's machine is elliptical,

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,000
but this one is a perfect circle.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,239
From this point, it can be determined

7
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,760
that this batch with quality issues

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,960
cannot be Qianjun's.

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,280
This is a matter for senior management.

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,039
The company
will naturally handle it well.

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,760
Furthermore,

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,039
Qianjun has now been
acquired by Changtian.

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,479
This minor issue won't be

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,719
of great concern to the company.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,119
Mr. Zhou, this is not a minor issue.

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,039
It concerns Qianjun's reputation.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,359
I will prove it on its behalf.

18
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,640
Mr. Chen, please have a look.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,480
For this matter,

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,000
I can only
report it to superiors for you.

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:13,920
After all,

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,719
Mr. Zhou and us

23
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,239
belong to two different departments.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,120
In principle, it is beyond our control.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,760
But I'll try my best.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,239
Okay, thank you.

27
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,680
Hello, could you help me check this?

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,159
You shouldn't cause trouble for others.

29
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,680
Who can handle this matter?

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,120
I don't want
to get involved in this mess.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,879
Mr. Liao, could I ask you for a favor?

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,840
It's the matter
related to Qianjun Industry, right?

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,959
How do you know?

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,359
These defective goods
really aren't from Qianjun.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't let Qianjun
take the blame for others.

36
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,359
You're quite tough.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Do you know who Mr. Zhou is?

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,960
I don't care who he is.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,479
And I'm not one
to meddle in other's affairs.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,199
However, I cannot turn a blind eye

41
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,319
to the slander against Qianjun.

42
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,280
Inquire about it and inform me

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,120
once confirmed.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,639
Okay.

45
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,879
You don't have to go.

46
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,039
Manager Zhao is there.
They'll tell the truth.

47
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,039
Once there's a result,
I'll tell you right away.

48
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,520
Okay.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,159
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

50
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,879
Tong Nian went to
your tech department today?

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,599
Okay, I see.

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
What shall we eat later?

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,759
What do you want to eat?

54
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,120
I really want to eat hot pot.

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Let's go have hot pot.

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,319
There's a new one.

57
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,879
Hello?

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,319
Hello, Tong Nian.

59
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
I am Mr. Zhou.

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,039
Come over.

61
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:13,800
Mr. Zhou?

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
I am off work now.

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
If it's not urgent,
can we talk about it tomorrow?

64
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,759
The batch of goods today
needs reevaluation.

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
We need your assistance.

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,919
Okay, I'll come up now.

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,080
Please wait a moment.

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,660
(Production Department)
Here, come in.

69
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,000
Mr. Zhou, you need me?

70
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,080
Sit.

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
Please go ahead
and tell me what you need.

72
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,199
I'd like to talk to you about the goods.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,039
Let's take our time.

74
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,479
Take a seat.

75
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
So, are you comfortable
working at Changtian?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,919
Are there any difficulties?

77
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,439
Everything is pretty good.

78
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,520
So how is the progress
on that batch of goods?

79
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,360
The data for those goods

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,279
is on my computer.

81
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,839
But my computer has an issue.

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,959
Help me take a look.

83
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,079
Okay.

84
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,839
Mr. Zhou, you've got a blue screen.

85
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,759
And I've already forced
a shutdown for you.

86
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,519
You smell great.

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,839
If no more matters, I'll take my leave.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,399
Don't go.

89
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,879
Mr. Zhou, please have some self-respect.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
Self-respect for what?

91
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
What have I done?

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,839
Don't be too stubborn
in your approach to things.

93
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,000
You need to learn to adapt.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,120
Didn't Mr. Chen tell you?

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,600
The thing
you should never do in Changtian

96
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,839
is meddling in affairs.

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,920
How about I teach you in person?

98
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,319
How will you teach?

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,759
Mr. Liao, she seduced me.
It has got nothing to do with me.

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,879
Stop it.

101
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,279
Nian, you really
shouldn't have gone to see him.

102
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,680
Didn't I send you a message in advance?

103
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,879
You didn't even realize
the seriousness of the matter.

104
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,439
What if I was late?

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,079
Mr. Liao,

106
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,399
you are generous and forgiving.

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,160
Please let me off this once.

108
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,079
I promise to obey orders from now on,

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
and follow commands.

110
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,079
I won't do
such thoughtless things again.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
Let's go, I'll take you home.
