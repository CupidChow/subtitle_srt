=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,912
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,399
Convince me if we must break up.

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
Tong Nian,

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,119
are you heartless?

6
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,960
Is it fun to toy with my feelings?

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,600
I think we are more suited
to be just friends.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,119
I don't lack friends.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,320
Then let's just act

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,039
as if we have never met before, okay?

11
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,799
Fine.

12
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,880
Then let's break up.

13
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,959
(Why did I dream about
him again? Bad luck.)

14
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,319
(Nagging Boss Hu)
Annoying.

15
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:38,120
Good kid. You've worked hard
on your business trip.

16
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,719
Come to the office today
to celebrate the Qixi Festival together.

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,719
There are free milk tea
and fried chicken.

18
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,599
Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed cannot be connected.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,519
Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed cannot...

20
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,719
Enough.

21
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,760
I know you're listening.

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
Changtian Industry has sent
a temporary examination notice today.

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,799
Hurry over to make up the numbers.

24
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,680
Don't let them underestimate us.
You know what I mean.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,439
Hu, I was just about to tell you.

26
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,680
My stomach ailment
is acting up again, and I...

27
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,840
I have a really bad headache,

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,960
and my throat feels uncomfortable.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm fading.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
300 for overtime.

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Okay, I'll be right there.

32
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,439
Hu, why such a big fuss?

33
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,360
What's the situation?

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,919
Mr. Liao, please.

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,560
Mr. Liao,

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,319
the materials for the examination
are ready for you.

37
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,759
In the conference room.
I'll lead you there.

38
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,280
Leaving before the meeting even starts?

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Hu, my head really hurts.

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm not feeling well.

41
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm going home.

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,199
How unusual for you.

43
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,319
Even giving up the overtime pay?

44
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,680
I really feel terrible this time.

45
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't take it anymore.

46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,759
I'll go back.

47
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,000
Mr. Hu,

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Mr. Liao would like to know

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,399
about your company's latest patent.

50
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,199
Is that okay?

51
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,199
No problem.

52
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,000
Please wait a moment.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,439
Okay.

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
Emergency help.

55
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,360
Hu, I just work in admin.

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
Let Ms. Feng handle the patent matter.

57
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
Feng Qian went
for a prenatal checkup today.

58
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,199
Mr. Liao is also a graduate
of Huagang University.

59
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,399
You are schoolfellows.
You can definitely do it.

60
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,439
I-I-I really can't do it.

61
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,079
Mr. Hu, is there any problem?

62
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,120
No problem.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,839
Please wait a moment.

64
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,399
Emergency help.

65
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,360
Take this.

66
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,879
Hello, Manager Zhao.

67
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,920
I'm the Technical Director Feng Qian
from Qianjun Technology.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,199
Please take me to Mr. Liao.

69
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,079
This way.

70
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,600
Your coffee.

71
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,079
Mr. Liao, this is
the Technical Director from Qianjun.

72
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,079
She's in charge of the patent matters.

73
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,000
This way, please.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,439
Hello, my name is Liao Yuncheng.

75
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,000
How should I address you?

76
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,519
Feng Qian.

77
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,120
Nice to meet you,

78
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,240
Feng Qian.

79
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,120
Nice to meet you, too.

80
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,199
If it's okay,

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,584
please exchange this

82
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,612
- for a cup of mocha for me.
- Mocha.

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,839
The coffee you made

84
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,000
reminds me of an old friend.

85
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,399
Mr. Liao, you must be joking.

86
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,639
Your way of flirting is outdated.

87
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,439
I've always been attentive
to the client.

88
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,600
This time,
it must be just a coincidence.

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,879
Okay.

90
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,720
Ms. Feng, please introduce

91
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,639
the design concept
of the patent in detail.

92
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,040
(Isn't it just for show?)

93
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,439
(Why are you taking it seriously?)

94
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,439
Ouch.

95
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,920
Then won't you be more serious?

96
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,319
I'm serious now.

97
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
Explain this to me again.

98
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
This is very simple.

99
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,360
Step one, take out a pen.

100
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,160
Step two, write down the answer.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,720
Step three, put away the pen.

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
You need to...

103
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,800
This is very simple.

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,439
Step one, we need
to turn on the machine.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,399
Step two,

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
let the air in.

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,959
Step three,

108
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,160
compress the air out.

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,920
Is that so?

110
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,399
Yes, it is.

111
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,240
The patent holder is not aware
of the product involved.

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,920
The patent is a forgery.

113
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,560
It does not pass the review.

114
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,319
Long time no see, Liao Yuncheng.

115
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Hello, friend.
