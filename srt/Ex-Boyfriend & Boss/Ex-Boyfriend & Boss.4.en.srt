00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:09,472
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,072
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,720
A car is a man's second home.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Some men would put a sign on their car

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,079
that reads "Neither car nor woman

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,280
is for a loan".

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,600
How could he possibly entrust his car

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,879
to you because you're trustworthy?

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,960
There's only one possibility.
He's hitting on you.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,800
Impossible. You're overthinking it.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Don't be in a hurry to deny it.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,679
Just think about it.
A man entrusts his car to you.

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,960
Out of a sense of responsibility,

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,159
would you

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,920
go check on the car for him every day?

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:42,359
Yes.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,159
Then, as time goes by,

18
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,119
would you start
thinking about the car's owner

19
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,600
while checking on the car?

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,399
Not necessarily.

21
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,679
He's on a business trip
and doesn't have time,

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,079
so he happens to leave his car with me.

23
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,359
Do you dare to make a bet with me?

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,679
Bet a month's worth of milk tea.

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,879
I bet he won't come back empty-handed.

26
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,760
He will prepare a gift
that's both special

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,599
and not very expensive.

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,400
When he sees you again,

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
he will say to you with sincerity,

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,599
"This is a small gift.

31
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,719
Please accept it.

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,680
Don't refuse it."

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,560
I won't bet.

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,799
I'm allergic to artificial romance.

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,879
I think you're allergic to romance.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,239
Anyway, I'm sure to win this bet.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,280
All right.

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,480
That's my sharing
about the previous makeup look.

39
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,599
Everyone can click the link below

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,159
to purchase the product.

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,799
Thank you for your gifts, darling.

42
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,040
Nian,

43
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,719
come.

44
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,519
I'd like to introduce her.

45
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,480
This is Nian, my roommate
and good friend.

46
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,200
She has an oval face
which is especially suitable

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,799
for the makeup look,
as I just mentioned.

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,239
See? Doesn't it look suitable?

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
That's about enough.

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,159
Alright, let's get started.

51
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,560
Nian.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,919
Thank you for your support, darling.

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:15,039
This is in support
of my diligent, sincere

54
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,639
and careful work.

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
It's for that fairy.

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,039
Thank you, sir.

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,280
No need.

58
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,879
But I have a request.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Please say it.

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
As long as I can do it,

61
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,800
I will definitely satisfy you.

62
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,240
I want to know the account

63
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
of the fairy next to you.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Nian,

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,919
dear Nian, fairy Nian,

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,639
please help me.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,039
You know

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,800
live streaming is my dream.

69
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,080
If I can't pursue my dream,

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
my life is just an empty shell.

71
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,759
Life would be meaningless for me.

72
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,840
I would have to go home
and inherit my billions.

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,120
That's not my style.

74
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,639
Nian, help me.

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,360
Please help me achieve it.

76
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
Just this once.

77
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
It's not gonna happen again.

78
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,159
I promise.

79
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Hello.

80
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,000
What is it? Say it.

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,879
There's a job for you.

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,439
About that promotional brochure
I mentioned last time,

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,520
you're in charge.

84
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,680
What kind do you want?

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Not low-end

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,680
but high-end.

87
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Make it

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,639
vibrant black

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,599
and flourishing white.

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,919
Make people blurt out the F-word

91
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,400
upon seeing it.

92
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,879
The F-word. Okay.

93
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,719
Okay.

94
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,080
What about the theme?

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,719
Any requirements?

96
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,560
No requirements.

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,759
Don't limit the theme.

98
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,960
But you must use your imagination.

99
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,800
No theme.

100
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,280
Okay.

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,159
What about the text?

102
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,000
It doesn't matter,

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,199
but it must reflect
the product's high quality.

104
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,040
If you do well, I'll grant you
paid annual leave.

105
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,439
A piece of cake.

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,680
Any other requirements?

107
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:54,560
(Hello, what are you doing?)

108
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,920
(Why does this man
keep going on and on?)

109
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,199
(I'll just reply a little.)

110
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,040
(Hello, Never-ending Gabber.)

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Come on.

112
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
A pleasant cooperation.

113
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,480
Mr. Cai.

114
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,600
Cheers.

115
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,160
(Do you have a boyfriend?)

116
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
(Straight to the point,)

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,079
(as expected.)

118
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,720
(Let me rain on your parade.)

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,240
(I do not have a boyfriend,)

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,279
(but I have a husband.)

121
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,079
(Married for three years.
My child is two and a half years old.)

122
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,560
(We're trying for a second child.)

123
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,959
(Please don't shower me
with any more gifts.)

124
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,360
(Loving me is fruitless.)

125
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,600
(Go pursue Dong.)

126
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,560
(She's still single.)

127
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,120
(Take care. Bye.)

128
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,120
Come on.

129
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,399
Come on, Mr. Cai.

130
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,279
Cheers.

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Cheers.

132
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,920
Mr. Liao,

133
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,759
got a girlfriend?

134
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,839
No.

135
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,879
Can I add you on WeChat?

136
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,839
But I have a wife.

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,199
Been married for three years.

138
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,800
My kid is two and a half years old.

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
We're trying for a second child.

140
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,480
(Pick me up at the airport)

141
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
(at 10 AM tomorrow, Liao.)

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,879
Mr. Liao, where are you going?

143
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,519
No rush. I have something for you.

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
For me?
