=Episode 2=

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,199
Scientific research proves

4
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,199
a Capricorn has a big temper.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,519
It's true.

6
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,160
Which country's scientists
researched that?

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,199
Also, may I ask you, Ms. Feng,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,520
as the Technical Director,

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,920
why you don't understand
even your own patents?

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,399
Isn't that because of you?

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,600
Isn't that because of your sudden visit?

12
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,200
Yuncheng,

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,920
do you think we can pass
the review this time?

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,479
What do you think?

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,479
Yuncheng.

16
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,200
No way.

17
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,200
I haven't said anything yet.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,359
It is already shown on your face.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Impersonating Feng Qian was my mistake,

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,120
but you can't let personal grudges
affect official business.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,719
If you want to pass the review,

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
use your professionalism.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
No, this actually isn't my job.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
Aren't you making this hard for me?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm only responsible for the review.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,400
Solving problems isn't my job either.

27
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,760
Fine, I won't stand you anymore.

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,040
You're giving up so easily?

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,640
You tell me.

30
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,000
How can we pass it?

31
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,120
This technology

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,159
is the core of your entire research.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Listen carefully.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm listening.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,359
Why do you always hit me?

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,959
This isn't the restroom.

37
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,120
I went the wrong way.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,479
Ask her
according to company review procedures.

39
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,800
She will answer truthfully.

40
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,080
What do I say?

41
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,439
Tong...

42
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,000
Ms. Feng.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,479
Next, we'll record the talk

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,680
according to the procedure.

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
Please answer my questions.

46
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,280
Go ahead.

47
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,120
Mr. Liao,

48
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,479
how's the review...?

49
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,439
It has ended.

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,719
Just wait for the notification.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
Liao, I already put the voice recorder

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,639
in your ex-girlfriend's pocket.

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,800
You went to great lengths for them

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,319
to pass the review.

55
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,199
You even taught her
how to deal with it on-site.

56
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,680
But the ungrateful woman
broke up with you. I...

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,919
Well,

58
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,439
I mean

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,319
you've gone to such lengths.

60
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,800
It would be such a pity
if it still doesn't get approved.

61
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,840
The matters regarding production

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,159
are beyond my scope as a researcher.

63
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,319
It's up to you to decide
whether to get involved or not.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,039
I'll follow you.

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,120
The company's top management
is going through changes.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,639
The production and technical departments
are always at odds.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
It's the same
with taking sides this time.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,439
Keep an eye

69
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,560
on the production department.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
Don't let them complicate matters.

71
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,360
Okay.

72
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,520
Hello.

73
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,599
The voice recorder?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,479
Okay.

75
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,639
Then please bring it over

76
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,400
to the business car at the door.

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,080
Thank you.

78
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,680
Liao, I'm kindly reminding you.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,680
She's your ex-girlfriend who dumped you

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,000
and infuriated you to no end.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,480
If you keep pestering her,
you'll repeat the same mistake.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,079
Forget what I said.

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,800
Manager Zhao.

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
Liao Yuncheng.

85
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,759
Please pass this on to Manager Zhao.

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
See you next time.

87
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,839
When is next time?

88
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,040
During the re-examination.

89
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,879
Your company won't make it

90
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,800
to the re-examination.

91
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,279
Why? What's the reason?

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
Get in the car if you want to know.

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,439
Do you really want to know the results?

94
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,680
Of course. This is my only job.

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,959
Then let's play a game.

96
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,720
Truth. You ask, I answer.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,160
You answer truthfully.

98
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,800
Then I'll answer truthfully.

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
Alright, no problem.

100
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,399
Are you single now?

101
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:34,959
Yes.

102
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,600
What's your impression of Qianjun?

103
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,279
Not bad.

104
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,959
Do you plan to get married this year?

105
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,040
No.

106
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,480
Can our company pass the review?

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,120
You have to wait for
our board's decision.

108
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,040
You!

109
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,639
Why did you want to break up with me?

110
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,639
I already explained back then.

111
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,959
You lied.

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,279
I want to hear the truth.

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,879
Liao Yuncheng,

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,879
after so many years,

115
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,439
you're still struggling with the reason?

116
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,240
Was it because I shamelessly

117
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,639
chased after you,

118
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,879
kept badgering you

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
and then dumped you,

120
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,879
so you can't accept it?

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,879
You've broken the rules.

122
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,480
You must tell the truth.

123
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,000
After all these years,
you haven't changed at all.

124
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,480
Never being satisfied
until you get an answer.

125
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,639
Never caring about others' feelings.

126
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,319
When will you ever understand

127
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,199
that not everyone will bend to your will

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,839
and not all questions

129
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,199
will definitely have an answer?

130
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,920
Son, buy a flower
for your girlfriend, will you?

131
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,079
I can make it cheaper.

132
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,600
Sir, you've misunderstood,

133
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,160
I...

134
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,079
No need.

135
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,920
We're not in a relationship
where we can send roses.

136
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,120
Correct.

137
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,959
From our appearances,

138
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,519
you should be able to tell

139
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,160
we are half-siblings
with different fathers and mothers.

140
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,680
What? Are they crazy?

141
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,639
Mr. Liao, we are not
from the same world,

142
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,800
so let's keep our distance
in the future.

143
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
Not from the same world?

144
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,120
Why didn't you say so back then?

145
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,519
I was too naive back then.

146
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,079
I didn't think so much.

147
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,920
Okay.

148
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Thank you for your honesty.

149
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,600
Then I'll take my leave.
