00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,072
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,079
How much did you drink?

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm not drunk.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,320
I'm very sober.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,719
I can still walk in a straight line.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,759
I'll show you.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,759
Look.

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,119
Straight line.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,600
See?

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,880
Straight, right?

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,439
You walked in a sine curve.

13
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,000
How much did you drink?

14
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,600
I didn't drink too much.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm not drunk.

16
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,319
I'm very sober.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,200
I can still walk in a straight line.
Let me show you.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,439
Watch closely.

19
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm walking straight, right?

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,120
Do you really like me?

21
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,599
So you'll be under my care from now on.

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,840
I've put on your shirt.

23
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,159
It's mine now.

24
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,800
The shirt is mine.

25
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,960
So you are mine too.

26
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,319
(Okay.)

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,879
(Both yours.)

28
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,639
I was clearly walking
in a straight line.

29
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,800
Alright, I'll take you home.

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
Liao Yuncheng.

31
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,520
I regret it.

32
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,280
Can we get back together?

33
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,639
Awake?

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,199
Did you sleep well?

35
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,879
Quite well.

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,319
Your coat.

37
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,319
Then I'll wash it and return it later.

38
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:29,919
Wait.

39
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,479
Sign this.

40
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,120
I won't.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
As far as I know,

42
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Mrs. Lu has always
disliked you going to such places.

43
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,800
If she finds out...

44
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,719
I'll sign it.

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I'll sign it.

46
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:05,344
(Employee Placement Agreement)

47
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,039
Alright, done.

48
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,840
You can delete the photo now.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't worry.

50
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,319
I wouldn't want to upset Mrs. Lu.

51
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,560
Ming's grandfather
lived to be 103 years old.

52
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,800
Do you know the secret to long life?

53
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,759
Because he has no granddaughter
as disobedient as you.

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,639
Wrong.

55
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,160
Because he never meddled in
other people's business.

56
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,959
8 a.m. tomorrow,

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,040
Changtian Industry, don't be late.

58
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,360
By the way,

59
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,680
I also have something to give you.

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,600
Could you please give this

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,639
back to your fiancee?

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,120
Fiancee?

63
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,759
Pei Ruolin's?

64
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,879
Everyone's here.
Go report to your department.

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
Okay, I'll get going.

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,120
Go ahead.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,879
Among Qianjun staff,

68
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,759
only Tong Nian
and Zhou Xinxin haven't come yet.

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,800
Okay.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,319
Tong Nian, welcome to Changtian.

71
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
Thank you, Chief Assistant Pei.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,360
Tong Nian, Changtian is a big company.

73
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,879
Habits like being late
and leaving early in small companies

74
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,360
should not be brought here.

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
Did you hear that?

76
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,279
Yes, Chief Assistant Pei.

77
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,839
But I was not late.

78
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,279
It's 7:55 now.

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,399
Still five minutes left.

80
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,319
At Changtian,

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,959
you should arrive
15 minutes early for any occasion.

82
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,560
She was not late.

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,639
Proceed with her onboarding.

84
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,040
Today, everyone should get to know
the company's business first.

85
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,759
As for the job assignments,
I'll announce later.

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,959
Isn't Chief Assistant Pei
Mr. Liao's fiancee?

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,800
I've got a feeling that
he's sabotaging his fiancee's plan.

88
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,319
Secretary Li, Chief Assistant Pei.

89
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,700
List the tech team members

90
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,399
who will get married
in the second half of the year.

91
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,800
The company is considering organizing
a collective wedding for them.

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay.

93
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:18,920
Shall I include you?

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,079
Who told you I am getting married?
