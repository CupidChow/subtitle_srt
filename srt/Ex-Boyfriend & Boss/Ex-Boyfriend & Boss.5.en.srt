=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:10,976
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,920
Mr. Liao, where are you going?

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,519
No rush. I have something for you.

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,280
For me?

6
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,119
I made it myself.

7
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,280
I remember you like eating it.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,840
Thank you, Mr. Liao.

9
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,679
Thank God I didn't bet with Dong.

10
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,159
Otherwise, I'd definitely owe her
a month's worth of milk tea.

11
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,399
Where are we going?

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,399
Let's go to your company.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,920
Okay.

14
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,159
Mr. Liao,

15
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll leave the next steps
in the process to you.

16
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,880
Rest assured, Mr. Hu.

17
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,640
Just wait for our company's process.

18
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,879
Why has he come again?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,920
Anything wrong?

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Hu asked me to make
a brochure poster for an exhibition,

21
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,959
but I've already revised it
dozens of times

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,319
and he's still not satisfied.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,760
I already don't know
how to revise it anymore.

24
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,079
Can I take a look at it?

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,159
Sure.

26
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,319
Just looking at the brochure.

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,480
Which one do you think
is more attractive?

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,120
The one with vibrant colors

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,200
and a beautiful woman.

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,680
This is called "the beauty economy".

31
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,920
Conveying more information
in a short amount of time.

32
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,400
Corporate promotion
is all about attracting attention.

33
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,280
Retain such keywords.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,439
These long sections
of detailed introduction

35
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,439
can just be deleted.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,719
This just solved the issue Hu mentioned

37
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,680
of not having a clear focus.

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Environmental protection and cleanliness
are the themes of new energy.

39
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,159
Using deep blue is too conservative.

40
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,759
You should try this color.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
This just solved the issue

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,039
Mr. Hu mentioned
of not feeling right about it.

43
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,759
Alright, I'm leaving.

44
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,080
If there's anything, come to me again.

45
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,840
Okay.

46
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,520
Why should I go to you for help?

47
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,319
(Are you there, fairy?)

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,400
(Are you there?
Why are you ignoring me?)

49
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,960
(This person couldn't be
a minor addicted to tipping)

50
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
(in live streams?)

51
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,240
(I should talk him out of it.)

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,319
(How old are you?)

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,840
(29.)

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,319
29!

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,400
That's not young anymore.

56
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,879
Then why does your profile show 18?

57
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,319
(Haven't you heard a saying?)

58
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,400
(A man remains a youth until death.)

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,080
Can't believe him.

60
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,639
What do you do?

61
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,759
(Project Manager.)

62
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,960
(New energy vehicles.)

63
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,719
New energy?

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
So, we are sort of

65
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,960
in the same profession.

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,879
Then I must save

67
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,479
this stray lamb.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,680
(A rich man tipped 100,000 yuan online)
(Is she gonna date online?)

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,480
(A post-95s college student devoted to
streamers by spending heavily on tips)

70
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:23,808
(Employees embezzled 8,000,000
for live streaming gifts, facing a sentence)

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
(All these are cautionary tales.)

72
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,680
(One wrong step leads to
a lifetime of regret.)

73
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,399
(By the way,)

74
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,360
(have you downloaded
the National Anti-Fraud Center app?)

75
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,079
(Yes.)

76
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,279
(That's good. Actually,
aside from splurging money on tips,)

77
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,199
(there are many ways
to express your love.)

78
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,439
(There's a question.)

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,079
(Would your husband mind you)

80
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,519
(chatting with a single handsome man?)

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
(Let's agree on a secret password.)

82
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,079
Aren't I just chatting with you?

83
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,040
Why do you make it sound like
we're having an affair?

84
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,000
Who's having an affair? Tell me.

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,240
I said spring is almost here,

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,360
so wild cats are going into heat.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,399
You should go to sleep.

88
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,680
Okay, good night.

89
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,519
Good night.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,079
Mind your own business.

91
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,600
Today's fan meeting is now over.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,839
See you?

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,000
Never see you again.

94
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,759
A strange man.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,399
(I'll be the one to finish
the talk, as I said.)

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,600
(See you.)

97
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,519
Nian,

98
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,800
it's bad.

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,879
Look.

100
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,720
The brand logo is blurred.
