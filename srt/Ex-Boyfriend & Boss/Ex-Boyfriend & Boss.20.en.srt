=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:10,976
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,320
Mr. Liao, you need me?

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,400
Nian,

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,480
Zhou Zhengyi will probably
lay low for a while.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,559
Why?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,640
I had Zhao Qiqi send
the evidence of his affair

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,600
to his wife.

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,320
And later at the board meeting,

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,600
I will impeach him in person.

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,679
Rest assured. I will speak up for you.

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,640
I didn't expect Zhou Zhengyi

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,159
to be a guy afraid of his wife.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,240
I believe you.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
Liao, it's almost time.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,240
The board meeting is about to start.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,520
Let's go.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
As you can all see,

19
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,079
this is

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,719
Zhou Zhengyi's doing.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,479
He lined his own pockets,

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,960
used power for personal gain,

23
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,560
used improper means to suppress peers,

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,200
misappropriated public funds

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,039
to buy luxury cars and properties,

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,119
took advantage of his position,

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,359
violated...

28
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:02,880
Yuncheng,

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,439
we need to verify
these accusations you've made.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
But the video Mr. Zhou

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,879
gave us privately

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
is solid evidence.

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,640
Zhou Zhengyi, do you have shame?

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,159
This is framing and slander.

35
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,799
Manager Zhao, please sit.

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,280
Something's wrong with the girl.

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,079
Is she the harassed female employee

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,920
you just mentioned?

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,680
I've heard

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,640
some rumors about her being shady.

41
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,359
Mr. Liao, you are still young.

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,239
Don't be deceived by her.

43
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,680
It would affect

44
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,879
the relationship between us
as the leaders of Changtian.

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,280
The evidence I submitted today

46
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,840
can all be taken for verification.

47
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
Then it'll take some time

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
to verify them.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,000
In my opinion,

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
let's hold a meeting another day

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,200
after we verify all this evidence.

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,519
Right now is the time
for the subsidiary to go public.

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,480
We can't afford any more trouble

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,519
that could mess things up.

55
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,800
This is the justice
of the board of directors?

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,719
They are siding with
Zhou Zhengyi obviously.

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,759
This is too much.

58
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,520
Since they can't handle it,

59
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,599
let's do it ourselves.

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,680
Chief Assistant Pei, you need me?

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,439
Tong Nian, I am very sorry

62
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,280
that we meet in this manner.

63
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,840
No need to apologize.

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,039
I just want to know

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,159
what the company will do

66
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,520
about Zhou Zhengyi harassing

67
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
the female staff.

68
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,919
Tong Nian, I can
empathize with your feelings,

69
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,199
but as you know,

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
our subsidiary is about to go public.

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,840
It is not the time

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
for any sort of public stir,

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,199
so a public apology

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,039
might be somewhat difficult.

75
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,719
Could you perhaps consider

76
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,759
making some other requests?

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
We will try our best to compensate you.

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,080
So you will not punish him.

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Nor will you make him

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,479
publicly apologize to me
and other female employees.

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,479
Nor can you guarantee
that he won't offend again, right?

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,479
Tong Nian,

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,319
Mr. Zhou's reputation in the company

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,879
has always been very good.

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,599
You're just a junior employee.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
We cannot fire a veteran of the company

87
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,879
based on one person's statement.

88
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,759
I see.

89
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,159
You constantly say

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,159
that you'd protect the rights
of female employees,

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,080
but you called me here just
to pressure me into compromising.

92
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,560
Tong Nian,

93
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:34,199
you need to think
from the company's perspective.

94
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,719
Even if Zhou Zhengyi
is 99 percent at fault,

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,199
are you not at all to blame?

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,599
Why are you trying to reason
with me instead of

97
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,960
going to the 99 percent wrong one?

98
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,000
If you truly look out for the company,

99
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,879
you shouldn't come here to silence me.

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
All I want is justice.

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,759
If the company can't meet my demands,

102
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,479
I'll resolve the issue in my own way.

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,919
Isn't that person going too far?

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,759
He should be exposed.

105
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,719
And if that's not satisfying,

106
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,120
I'll just...

107
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,319
I'll use scissors
to cut off his manhood.

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,800
Alright.

109
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,439
Don't I still have you by my side?

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
Nian,

111
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,240
have you ever thought
that once you expose him,

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,639
you might be affected
beyond expectation?

113
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,079
Aren't you scared?

114
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,759
It's alright.

115
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm already prepared.

116
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,160
So

117
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,800
let's get started.

118
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,839
Excuse me

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,439
for taking up a bit of your time.

120
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,600
I am Tong Nian
from the After-sales Service Department

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,379
at Changtian Industry.

122
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,319
Today,

123
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
I'd like to publicly accuse

124
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,199
Zhou Zhengyi, the head
of Production Department,

125
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,680
of using his authority to commit

126
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,720
despicable acts
against female employees.

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,079
I don't know how many

128
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,240
of you will pay attention,

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,600
but I still want to tell everyone

130
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,920
with my own strength

131
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
to protect themselves.

132
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,399
(Changtian Industry executive
suspected of harassing female employees)

133
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,160
It has gone viral.

134
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,319
Nian, it's gone viral.

135
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,480
Look, many major accounts
are sharing your post.

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Zhou Zhengyi is definitely finished.
What do you think?

137
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,360
Qiufen,

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,839
I'll go out for a moment.

139
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,680
At this hour,

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,839
I'll accompany you.

141
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,399
No, it's okay.

142
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,160
I want to be alone for a while.

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,399
Don't worry.

144
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,199
Really?

145
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,240
Are you okay, Nian?

146
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,519
I'm fine. Are you okay?

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,040
Yes, I'm fine. I'll take you home.

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,399
Going home?

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
Dong is home alone.

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,399
Qiufen?

151
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,959
Qiufen?
