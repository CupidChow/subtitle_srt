00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,472
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,816
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,119
Anyway,

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,199
I've already said everything I need to.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,920
You think about it carefully.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,760
Drink less alcohol.

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,359
Should I also do something?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,719
Tong Nian,

9
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,759
you want to talk to me?

10
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,560
Chief Assistant Pei,

11
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,560
I asked you here

12
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,960
to say a few things to you.

13
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,920
Go ahead.

14
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,960
Firstly, from a work perspective,

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,159
since I'm now
on the Huagang project team,

16
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,159
I should fully comply with
Mr. Liao's work arrangements.

17
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,680
Therefore, my staying or leaving
should not be decided by you or me.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,319
As the person in charge
of the Huagang project,

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,280
I believe Mr. Liao has
both the ability and the qualifications

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,519
to properly resolve all matters
related to the project.

21
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:19,519
Since you're not part of the team,

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,680
please do not overstep
your authority to manage.

23
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,439
Secondly, on a personal emotional level,

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,879
Liao Yuncheng and I
are childhood friends,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,280
and we have long been in a relationship,

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,719
so please,

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,760
in your interactions

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,079
with Yuncheng in the future,

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,560
do not try to flirt with him,

30
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,719
in case you end up like Zhou Xinxin.

31
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,319
Yuncheng doesn't have that much time

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,079
for your personal emotional issues.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,799
And I believe you are also aware

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,239
that even without me,

35
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,959
it's impossible for him to like you.

36
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,359
You...

37
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,879
Thirdly,

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,400
from a personal grudge perspective,

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,760
I can overlook your arrogant attitude,

40
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,640
but I can never tolerate

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,879
your sneaky actions

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,599
and malicious slander behind my back.

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,319
From now on,

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,159
if you provoke me again

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,760
or let me know about

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,120
any remarks detrimental to me

47
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,680
coming from your mouth,

48
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,719
I'll return the favor twofold.

49
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,560
Tong Nian,

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
aren't you afraid

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
that I'll fire you?

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,199
Chief Assistant Pei,

53
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't think

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,159
you have that much authority?

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,560
Yuncheng, you...

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,520
Call me Mr. Liao
at the office from now on.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,759
If the Huagang project
cannot accommodate Tong Nian,

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,639
I will resign.

59
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's go.

60
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,280
I didn't expect you
to have such a tough side.

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
You showed quite
a fiery side just now too.

62
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,719
I was supporting you.

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
You should treat me to a meal.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,479
Okay, no problem.

65
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,000
What do you want to eat? You decide.

66
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,919
Come to my house and cook for me.

67
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,599
I'll think about it.

68
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,199
You prepared all these?

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,199
I bought them casually while shopping.

70
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
I thought I was back at my home.

71
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,520
You wait here. I'll go cook.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Alright.

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,920
Use the light-colored
blending brush first to

74
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:29,279
evenly dip into this light color

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,839
and then apply it to our upper eyelids.

76
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,040
Sweep across a large area.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,319
Then apply a lot to the lower eyelids.

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,160
Then we use a small eye makeup brush

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,399
to apply this earth-toned eye shadow

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,079
to the latter half of our eyelids.

81
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,319
There. Doesn't it look nice?

82
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,439
(I won't come home today.
Take care of yourself.)

83
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,000
What? You're going
to stay overnight at his place?

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,639
(Gabber?)

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,199
(Gabber, thank you.)

86
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,680
(You have received a new message.)

87
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,824
(Pei Ruolin)

88
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,800
Yuncheng,

89
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,879
are you still mad at me?

90
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,160
What's the matter?

91
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,600
Regarding what happened today,

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,279
I would like to explain.

93
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,560
I was not picking on Tong Nian.

94
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,399
You don't need
to explain anything to me.

95
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,360
Then regarding the Huagang project...

96
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,519
If it's about work,

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,920
you can send me an email.

98
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I have to spend time with my family now.

99
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,720
Fairies don't eat vegetables.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't be picky. Eat it.

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Thanks for your care, Gabber.
