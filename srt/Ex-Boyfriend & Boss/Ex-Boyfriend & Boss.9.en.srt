00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,502
=Ex-boyfriend & Boss=

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,055
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,679
It's you again.

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,480
We met at the hospital.

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,199
But back then, I didn't know it was you.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,519
By the way, Yuncheng
really likes the flowers you sent.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,399
He has been asking me to thank you.

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,280
You are welcome.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,920
Nian, your earrings are so pretty.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,880
I've always
wanted a pair of earrings like these.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
Can I exchange with yours?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,520
Mine are very cheap.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,280
If you like them, I'll give them to you.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,920
No, gifts

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,600
would be meaningful
only if we exchange.

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,479
Anyway, these big brands

17
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,039
send me some limited editions every year

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,200
that I don't like.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
You keep them.

20
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,679
By the way,

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,000
is Yuncheng's car key

23
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,280
also with you?

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:09,879
Yes.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,959
Here it is.

26
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,879
Looking forward to seeing you
at Changtian.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,840
Some people

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
are really good at courting favor.

29
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,959
Well, I can't compare to those

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,760
who treat work as matchmaking event.

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,959
Our company is going to be acquired,

32
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,280
and everyone knows it.

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,879
You went to Xinqiao to see Mr. Liao.

34
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,040
You were just trying to
cozy up to him in advance.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,519
You send ''good morning''
and ''good night''

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,040
to Mr. Liao every day in the work group.

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,760
Could I assume you're

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
in a romantic relationship?

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,959
I...

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,719
We are neat freaks.

41
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,719
Don't touch us.

42
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,319
I have an announcement to make.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,479
The small goal of leading you guys
to earn five billion yuan back then

44
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,960
doesn't seem to be able to be achieved.

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
This is the best result I can achieve.

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,280
Everyone, consider
whether to go to Changtian,

47
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,439
or seek another path.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,159
Sign here
if you are seeking another path.

49
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,039
You can get fifty percent.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Everyone, take a placement form.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,919
Those willing to go to Changtian,

52
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,039
write your name in the placement column.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,719
Such a difficult choice.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,919
Those who don't want placement,

55
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,280
write it in another column.

56
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:09,152
(Give up placement: Dong Nian)

57
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,479
What's the matter?

58
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,639
Qiufen.

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,360
I lost my job.

60
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,240
No way. Your boss fired you?

61
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,759
No.

62
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,120
Our company was acquired by Changtian.

63
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,599
I voluntarily declined the placement.

64
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,639
So I became unemployed.

65
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,560
Why?

66
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,280
Who would choose to work
under Liao Yuncheng

67
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,400
and his fiancee?

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,759
That would be torture.

69
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,360
Wait.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,479
Liao Yuncheng?

71
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,879
Your ex-boyfriend?

72
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,800
He's back in China?

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,240
And he has a fiancee now?

74
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
But that doesn't matter.

75
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,599
What's important is

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
that I attended many interviews today,

77
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,919
but I haven't received

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,759
any offer.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,919
I know it's hard
to find a job these days,

80
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,959
but I didn't expect it to be this hard.

81
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,879
But it doesn't matter.

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Today, we won't return

83
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,240
until we're drunk.

84
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,480
With your drinking capacity?

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,519
Forget it.

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,439
You look down on me.

87
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,800
Come on.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,439
Wait for me.

89
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,959
Easy.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,759
It seems I'm really drunk now.

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm having illusions.

92
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a real person. Want to feel it?

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
(Anyway, it's just a dream.)

94
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,480
(Then I shall be a bit bolder.)

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,040
(Looks really good.)

96
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,079
(Quite sturdy.)

97
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,920
Don't go too far.

98
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,519
Let go of that girl.

99
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
Why are you here?

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
I'm here to take her home.

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,040
Take her home?

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,439
Isn't that my home too?

103
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,639
Then where should I go?
