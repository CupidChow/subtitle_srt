00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,440
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,310
Maybe it's my age,
but I keep getting lost in old memories.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,280
I'm even starting to like oldies
and pop songs from back in the day.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,320
Hwa Young, don't be silly.
You're not getting old.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,260
You're still the same cover girl
from our school days.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Going up.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,330
(That Night of Music and Memories)

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,000
(We invite you back to the good old days.)

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,040
<i>Whether you know my heart</i>
<i>or just pretend not to</i>

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,910
<i>Time just keeps on slipping by</i>

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,550
<i>Even when you brush right past me</i>

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,250
<i>And turn away, pretending not to see</i>

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,950
<i>My heart flows on like a river</i>

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,330
<i>- Are you a rainbow drifting away?</i>
- What do you think? Fun, right?

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,430
<i>I would run to you</i>

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,530
<i>I would soar through the sky</i>

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,100
Dad, I'm going to run to the restroom
before Tae Pyung starts singing.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,540
- Okay.
<i>- If you'd come</i>

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>Into my heart</i>

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,010
Gosh, I can't believe
a place like this exists.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,880
For once, he didn't get scammed.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,350
I'm just so glad
he can sing his heart out here.

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,720
Are you okay?

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,360
That weak ankle of yours...

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,500
- You're not seriously hurt, are you?
- No, I'm fine.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,700
- Here, let me at least take your bag.
- Look at those two lovebirds.

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,870
What?

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,170
- Shall we?
- Okay.

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,180
I've been looking all over for you.
Where'd you run off to?

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,520
What are you talking about?
Can't I even use the restroom?

31
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,280
I was just in the restroom. What is it?

32
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,950
- It's an emergency. Hurry, come with me.
- What?

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,730
<i>For countless days</i>

34
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,440
<i>Though I tried with all my might</i>

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,010
<i>Nothing seemed to get any better</i>

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,450
<i>You hide your heart</i>
<i>afraid I might find out</i>

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,690
<i>All the many casual goodbyes around me</i>

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,520
- Hey, Jang Mi!
- Tae Pyung! I heard your clothes ripped.

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,590
How did that happen?

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,330
This is a disaster.
You have to fix it, quick.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
He was practicing his dance moves
and the seam just completely split open.

42
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,300
I'm on soon. What am I going to do?

43
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,640
I can't go on for my debut stage
in just a dress shirt.

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,310
We're short on time,

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,670
but don't worry.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,200
Gosh, you've got everything in there.

47
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,400
So that's why
Tae Pyung told me to get you.

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
Turn around.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,670
Gosh, be careful.

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,140
You're so high-maintenance.
What would you have done without this?

51
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,450
You're so glad I'm here, aren't you?

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,020
Hey, hold still. All done. There.

53
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,020
We're out of time.

54
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,490
<i>All of my days</i>

55
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,670
Jang Mi said she went to the restroom.
Where did she go?

56
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,870
Tae Pyung should be on any minute now.

57
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,080
Tae Pyung's coming on. Jang Mi...

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,020
Jang Mi's gone. What? My Jang Mi is gone.

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,050
- Jang Mi!
- It's okay, Suk Hee. She will be back.

60
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,290
It's okay. Where is she?
What's taking her so long?

61
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,830
- What is it? Do you know them?
- No.

62
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,030
I'm just surprised to see
the owner of the side dish shop here.

63
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
So, what do you think, Professor?

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
It's a nice change of pace coming here,
isn't it?

65
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,740
Yes, it's wonderful.

66
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,610
Actually, I...

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Actually?

68
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,520
As long as I'm with you, Hwa Young,

69
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,590
I'd be happy anywhere.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
You're such a flatterer.

71
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,160
What? Isn't that...

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,390
Jang Mi's gone.

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Suk Hee, it's okay.
Let's sit and wait for Jang Mi, all right?

74
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes, it's okay. There, there.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,570
Here, have some of this.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,940
Let's have a snack while we wait.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,070
Jang Mi's gone. Jang Mi!

78
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,570
- Jang Mi!
- Suk Hee!

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,110
Suk Hee!

80
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,980
- Jang Mi!
- Suk Hee!

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,880
Tonight, performing at our bar...

82
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,150
is a hot new singer.

83
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,420
Please welcome Tae Pyung! Come on out!

84
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,390
Tae Pyung!

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,600
Hello, everyone!
The greatest ocean is the Pacific.

86
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,600
The greatest singer is Oh Tae Pyung.
And that's me!

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,420
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

88
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,650
<i>Let's party until we drop,</i>
<i>let's have a drink</i>

89
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,060
<i>Tonight, you and I</i>

90
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,490
<i>We'll become one and go</i>

91
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

92
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,100
<i>Let's party until we drop,</i>
<i>let's have a drink</i>

93
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,740
Look. The CEO of Dream Hotel is here.

94
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,470
What? Where?

95
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,340
Over there. That glamorous woman.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,650
- Dad?
- What?

97
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,520
- It's nothing.
<i>- A drink for a hangover, and for thirst</i>

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,690
<i>Because it's Friday night</i>

99
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,130
Oh, Dad.

100
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,230
Hey, Dad.

101
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,930
What? What about Mom?

102
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Suk Hee.

103
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,740
Suk Hee. Oh, Suk Hee.

104
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,380
Mom!

105
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,280
Look, Jang Mi's here. It's Jang Mi.

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Jang Mi!

107
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,650
I was so scared. I thought you were gone.

108
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,020
It's okay, all right? It's okay.

109
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,530
She made a huge scene
crying that you’d disappeared.

110
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,560
I really got an earful.

111
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Suk Hee.

112
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,860
You're happy to see Jang Mi, aren't you?

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,100
Yes, I'm so happy. Jang Mi's here.

114
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,840
I'm so sorry, Mom.

115
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,880
I said I was just going to the restroom.
You must've been so worried I wasn't back.

116
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,410
I'm so sorry, okay?

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,950
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,750
I'm so sorry, Mom, okay?

119
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,520
Why are you crying?
I would never leave you.

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,290
It's okay.

121
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,940
Ma'am! Did your husband beat you up again?

122
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,380
Oh, my gosh.

123
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,780
Why do you put up with that?

124
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,720
Some people just live
because they can't die.

125
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,620
Stay out of sight when your face is messy.
It's unpleasant for us.

126
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,690
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,330
Grandpa! Don't I get any praise?

128
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,700
Look at you. What's gotten into you today?
Waking up so early...

129
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,100
to have breakfast and tea
with your old grandpa.

130
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,140
I suppose she's finally realizing
how important her company position is.

131
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
You think so?

132
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,040
By the way,
clear your schedule this afternoon.

133
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,450
- You too, Seo Rin.
- Why, Grandpa?

134
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,620
What do you mean why?
At your hotel restaurant,

135
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,280
I was just thinking
we'd have a meal together.

136
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,960
Grandpa, does this mean you're finally
going to let me date Chef Kang Jun Ho?

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,460
Don't get ahead of yourself, Ma Seo Rin.

138
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,060
Oh, for crying out loud.

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,430
I don't have a single decent tie.

140
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,270
You've never worn a tie in your life.
Why the sudden search for one?

141
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,110
Come to think of it, you've put
a lot of effort into your looks.

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,110
When you get older, you have to polish up
and look sharp.

143
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,780
That's how you earn respect
wherever you go.

144
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,490
Imagine being old and dressing sloppily.
How do you think people would treat you?

145
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,920
It would all reflect badly on you.

146
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,230
Do people still blame the wife
for her husband's terrible fashion sense?

147
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,900
I agree with you,

148
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,830
but the problem is
that's not how other people see it.

149
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,940
Since when have you ever cared
what other people think?

150
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,710
Coming from the man wearing ratty T-shirts
and socks with holes?

151
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,880
I've decided to
turn over a new leaf, okay?

152
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,050
You should go to the hair salon
once in a while too.

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,790
- Okay?
- All right, I get it.

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,520
- Baek Ho, let's go.
- Okay, Mom.

155
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,530
I need to talk to Dad about something.
You can head to work first, Mom.

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
You do?

157
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
So, a little father-son date, is it?

158
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,600
Okay. I'll get out of your hair. I'm off!

159
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,110
Okay.

160
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,510
So, what's up?

161
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,850
What do you think?

162
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,620
I'd like an explanation for why you were
with CEO Chae yesterday.

163
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,020
- What?
- At the lounge bar yesterday.

164
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,920
I saw you sitting there all cozy
with CEO Chae.

165
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh, that?

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,370
Kid, it was just networking.
Strictly business.

167
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,710
What's with that look?

168
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,110
What, do you just go around
suspecting everyone?

169
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,810
If you see a man and a woman together,
you just assume the worst?

170
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,010
Me? Suspect you?

171
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,450
Come on. A dad who only has eyes for Mom
isn't going to have a wandering eye.

172
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Then that's settled, son.

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
And here I was thinking
it was something serious.

174
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,860
I was there on business for Dream Hotel,

175
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,970
and I just happened to run into CEO Chae
on her way out.

176
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,310
She was invited by a singer she sponsors.
She was on her way there.

177
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,910
She suggested we talk business on the way,
so I just tagged along.

178
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,340
I see.

179
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,410
I can't believe you're grilling me
about this.

180
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,780
Wait, why am I even explaining myself
to you?

181
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,920
Anyway, how did you end up there?

182
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,860
That singer CEO Chae sponsors
is a close friend of mine.

183
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,100
- Look at the time. I have to go.
- Okay.

184
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,530
Have a good day.
I'm heading out in a bit myself.

185
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,940
That kid.

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,580
When could he have possibly seen that?

187
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,910
That was delicious. Thank you.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,270
Was the sea bream steak to your liking?

189
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,700
I made sure to prepare a dish
that's easy to digest.

190
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,210
- Yes.
- The lemon butter sauce was great.

191
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,210
And the black sesame panna cotta
was exceptional.

192
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
Right, Grandpa?

193
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,080
- I can speak for myself.
- I also thought...

194
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,790
Why waste your breath? I can tell
what you're thinking from your expression.

195
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,560
Does she want the rest of us
to just shut it?

196
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,930
Come to think of it, Seo Rin takes after
her mother, Chae Hwa Young.

197
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,400
Then, for a relaxing finish,
we'll serve a tea pairing.

198
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,100
No, that's all right.
We can have tea at home.

199
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,340
Very well, Chairman.

200
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,140
He's always so cool.

201
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,950
Right, Grandpa?

202
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,950
Sitting here like this...

203
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,650
feels like a pre-wedding family meeting.
Right, Mom?

204
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,390
- It does, doesn't it?
- A pre-wedding meeting?

205
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,360
Seo Rin. Watch your mouth.

206
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,500
- How can you say something so ridiculous?
- It's not ridiculous at all.

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,130
Seo Rin has a point.

208
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Pardon?

209
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,070
It's not as if you and Mrs. Yeom
are strangers.

210
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,870
Why get so worked up about it?

211
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,070
Exactly.

212
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,780
That's exactly why
I arranged this meeting.

213
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,620
Yes, but I was going to make up
with San Wol on my own.

214
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,350
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble, Father.

215
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,050
And to call in Assistant Manager Jin,
who'd already resigned,

216
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,820
- I was wondering what this was all about.
- Well,

217
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,560
it's not a matter that requires
your permission,

218
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,100
but since we all live together,

219
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,230
I have something of a major announcement
to make.

220
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,400
That's also part of why we're here.

221
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Don't tell me...

222
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,610
That's right.

223
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,110
I've decided to spend...

224
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,050
the rest of my life with Mrs. Yeom.

225
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,180
- Father!
- Oh, my goodness, Chairman.

226
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,190
You didn't say a word to me about this.

227
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,090
How could you spring such
a big announcement like this on me?

228
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,920
What's wrong? You don't like the idea?

229
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,190
Do I not like the idea? Don't be silly.

230
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,960
I was just so surprised.
It was all so sudden.

231
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't like it, Grandpa.
I'm completely against it.

232
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,540
- Seo Rin.
- Grandpa. No, Chairman.

233
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,210
Assistant Manager Jin was my errand girl,
practically my servant.

234
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,610
And her mother is no different.

235
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,750
I don't care if they say everyone's equal.

236
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,380
For someone
as distinguished as you, Grandpa,

237
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,120
to even consider living with
a woman like her...

238
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,520
- is something I will never accept.
- Seo Rin.

239
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,860
Ma Seo Rin.
You'd better shut it and not ruin this.

240
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,290
That little brat.

241
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,560
She's trying to ruin everything
right at the finish line.

242
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,130
Her mother's antics weren't enough,
and now this one pipes up.

243
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,430
Just goes to show,
like mother, like daughter.

244
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,570
I'm dead set against this, Grandpa.

245
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,070
I don't care if you date this woman
outside the house, Grandpa,

246
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,810
but I will fight you tooth and nail
if you bring her into our home.

247
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,050
And if you insist
on marrying this woman anyway,

248
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,680
I'll run away from home
and just kill myself.

249
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,020
You know I do what I say
I'm going to do, right?

250
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,250
I don't care about living anyway.

251
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,530
Seo Rin.

252
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Seo Rin!

253
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,810
- I'm home.
- Welcome back. How were the lunch boxes?

254
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,050
They were a big hit. We should make flyers
for the side dishes and pass them out.

255
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,050
That's a relief.

256
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,350
- Baek Ho is waiting for you, Jang Mi.
- What?

257
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,460
He said he has something to tell you.
Why don't you go on in?

258
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,560
Something to tell me?

259
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,760
A singer's most important asset
is their voice.

260
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,200
Hey, drink this Ssanghwa Tea.
It's good for your throat.

261
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Here you go.

262
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,640
It feels like just yesterday
Dad was scolding me for sneaking eggs.

263
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,140
- Now you're giving me a special treat?
- Hey, come on.

264
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,510
Why are your ambitions as small
as this cup, Oh Tae Pyung?

265
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,880
To me, you're a legend, a superstar.

266
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,290
You're destined for greatness.
You can't be calling this a luxury.

267
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,120
Okay, I get it, my friend.

268
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,460
You asked to see me?

269
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,890
I have something to discuss with you.
Please have a seat.

270
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,100
You sound like you own the place.

271
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,270
Tae Pyung. Hey, Oh Tae Pyung.
Come out here a minute.

272
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,170
Yes? What for?

273
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,370
I said, get out here.

274
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,010
What in the world does he want?

275
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,110
I've been thinking...

276
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,750
Thinking about what?

277
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,890
- Hey, kid. Learn to read the room.
- Why?

278
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,430
You have to give them space to hit it off!
That's how people get married.

279
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,960
You're unbelievable.

280
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,600
You went ballistic
when Tae Sook said she's getting married.

281
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,100
So you want me to file a public petition
to install a CCTV camera near the banner?

282
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,270
But installing a hidden camera
wouldn't be admissible in court,

283
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,040
- and we could even get countersued.
- Countersued?

284
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,580
People are sensitive to invasion
of privacy and defamation these days.

285
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,450
- So we should do nothing out of fear?
- That's not it.

286
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,790
My point is we do this by the book
and catch the culprit.

287
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,590
We put that banner up legitimately,
after all.

288
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,730
The illegal part is
that they took it down without permission.

289
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,600
Exactly. Who do they think they are,
taking down our banner?

290
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,600
My point exactly. So we can ask them
to patrol the area more frequently...

291
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,870
- and see if we can catch the culprit.
- Well, no time like the present.

292
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,610
It's not like we're the ones
who did something wrong.

293
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,340
So there's no reason
for us to break the law.

294
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,150
Hello.

295
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,680
Yes, I just put the banner back up
and filed the report...

296
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,990
What?

297
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,660
You're saying I'm not allowed
to hang the banner?

298
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,060
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you handling that so quickly.

299
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,660
Just tell me why.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,400
Why did you want me
to ban banners in that area?

301
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,070
They're an eyesore.

302
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,900
Plastered all over the place like that?
They bring down property values.

303
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
All right, I won't ask any more questions.

304
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,580
Thank you, sir. I'll come see you soon.

305
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,950
Really?

306
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,520
A "big shot" with some pull in Taean?

307
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,120
Yes. He pulled some strings for me...

308
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,160
and made it so no banners
can be put up whatsoever.

309
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
Good work.

310
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,890
Is something wrong?

311
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,100
The old man has made a mess of things.

312
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,700
And because of it,
Seo Rin has declared she's moving out.

313
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
All right.

314
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,120
If that's really how you all feel,

315
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,960
then I'll reconsider
keeping Mrs. Yeom by my side.

316
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,590
Do you really mean that, Grandpa?

317
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,000
I do, you little rascal.

318
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,370
How am I supposed to date anyone
when you're so terrifying?

319
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,140
Thank you, Grandpa.

320
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,710
My grandpa's the best.
This is exactly why I love you!

321
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
Father.
Thank you for listening to our concerns.

322
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,310
You little rascal, I can't breathe.

323
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,690
Grandpa, you want to play a game of Go?

324
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,330
The nerve of that woman!
There's a limit to how you treat people.

325
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm so upset, really.

326
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,800
Mom, there's no need to be upset.
Have faith in the Chairman.

327
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,440
You saw it yourself.

328
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,780
He just went scrambling after that brat...

329
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,450
- and told us to just go home.
- Wasn't this to be expected?

330
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,380
Did you think CEO Chae would roll over
and let us into their house?

331
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,190
Then how long are we supposed to play
this tug-of-war?

332
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm just so tired of it all.

333
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,960
These things take time.

334
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,560
It's about getting
into Chairman Ma's home.

335
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,800
It's a huge deal.

336
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,870
It'd be strange to get in right away,
don't you think?

337
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,900
You're right.

338
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,400
We've been patient this long.
What's a little more waiting?

339
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,880
No matter what happens,
we are moving into that house, Hong Ju.

340
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,780
Just wait and see.

341
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,250
Gosh, seriously.

342
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,890
So you're saying they took down
every single banner in the area?

343
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,090
- This is definitely...
- Someone must be pulling the strings.

344
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,830
I was thinking the same thing.

345
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:01,000
There has to be someone higher up
with pull to control the county office.

346
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,840
So the people who did this to Suk Hee
are powerful.

347
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,650
At least we've figured
that much out, right?

348
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,580
I guess it's not a total dead end, then.

349
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,040
Professor, is this a good time?

350
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,940
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- Not at all, Hwa Young.

351
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,480
I can't believe you called me first.

352
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm wide awake now.

353
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,020
I know it's late.
Is it a bad time to talk?

354
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,660
Not at all.
Just getting to hear your voice...

355
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,330
- is wonderful.
- Me too.

356
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,600
I couldn't sleep because I wanted to hear
your voice, Professor Kang.

357
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,900
I miss you, Hwa Young.

358
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Me too.

359
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,240
When should we get together?

360
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,850
(Dream Hotel)

361
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,220
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

362
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,680
What about that thing
I asked you to check?

363
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,690
There's been no movement
from Yeom San Wol or Jin Hong Ju.

364
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Really?

365
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,120
That's strange.

366
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,560
The Chairman wants to see you
and Director Ma in his study.

367
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,100
With Seo Rin?

368
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,180
Why does he want to see us in his study
during work hours?

369
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,080
He's ready to train you as his successor.

370
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,680
So don't mess around
in front of the directors.

371
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,920
Show them what you're really made of.

372
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,220
So you want me to put on an act
and be a good little girl?

373
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,360
I'm not kidding. Take this seriously.

374
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,270
What's gotten into you?

375
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,770
Just listen to your mother.

376
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,650
My sweet Seo Rin. This is your lucky mole.

377
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,320
- Don't just stand there. Have a seat.
- Grandpa!

378
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,390
What is she doing here?

379
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,090
She quit, didn't she?

380
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,530
I'm sure she's just here
to say her goodbyes.

381
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
Isn't that right?

382
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,500
Allow me to introduce myself.

383
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,110
I just joined the Corporate Strategy Team
at Dream Group headquarters.

384
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,510
- I'm Jin Hong Ju.
- What?

385
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,810
- Father!
- Grandpa!

386
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,150
Since you said Dream Hotel has no use
for Assistant Manager Jin,

387
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,180
I had no choice but to bring her
to headquarters myself.

388
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,420
Are you saying you're going to keep her
by your side, Chairman?

389
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,760
What would I do with an employee
who's only studied hotel management?

390
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,930
The plan is to assign her to the hotel,
but as an employee of headquarters.

391
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
What did you say?

392
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,340
Assistant Manager Jin, Director Ma,
please step outside.

393
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,420
So you're saying Assistant Manager Jin
won't be an employee of Dream Hotel,

394
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,330
but she'll work there
under the main office's authority?

395
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,260
And is there a problem with that?

396
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm the one who transferred her to India.

397
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,100
But she resigned because
she didn't want to go, didn't she?

398
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,670
You should have accepted her resignation.
Instead, you call her back,

399
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,580
just to shove her in my face
at my own hotel?

400
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,780
- You're the one who started this.
- Father!

401
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,010
Don't you raise your voice at me!

402
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,550
- You're the one who defied me!
- Right, Chairman.

403
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,120
Business is business, and family matters
should be handled at home.

404
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,460
Are you saying I can't separate business
from my personal life?

405
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,390
I'm asking you to make that distinction.

406
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,800
I can understand your feelings
about Yeom San Wol,

407
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,270
but letting feelings affect the company
isn't like you, Chairman.

408
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,570
I guess I'm just getting old.

409
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,110
What can I do?

410
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,080
Just like how I want to give
our dear Seo Rin a nice position,

411
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,210
I can't help but feel the same way
toward Jin Hong Ju.

412
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,790
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

413
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,870
That crafty old fox.
How dare he undermine me like that?

414
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,410
- So he's decided to take me on, has he?
- Please don't be too upset.

415
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,470
How can you be so nonchalant?
Is that all you have to say?

416
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,110
While that old man was pulling this stunt,
you didn't notice a thing.

417
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,010
What have you been doing this whole time?

418
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,380
To make sure word didn't get out,

419
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,950
the Chairman gave the order directly.

420
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,420
I don't care if it was
a direct order or not.

421
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,290
You should have read his mind
like the back of your hand!

422
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,960
You've been by my side for decades.
How can you still let me get blindsided?

423
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,330
You'll be able to achieve
your dream soon enough,

424
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,670
- so please try not to be so impatient.
- When? When is that going to be?

425
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,270
With that old fox stabbing me in the back,
just when is that supposed to happen?

426
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,910
Just you wait.

427
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,410
I'm going to take over all of Dream!

428
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,400
(The First Man)

429
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,600
Dream Hotel's CEO was there too.
My generous sponsor.

430
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,540
Why don't we bring her
one of our lunch boxes later?

431
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,270
Are you going somewhere today?

432
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,410
- What's it to you? Don't cross the line.
- Professor Kang Nam Bong?

433
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,150
- I don't see Chef Kang Jun Ho anywhere.
- She's the spitting image of Director Ma.

434
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm here to deliver this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young.

435
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
