00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,110
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,510
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,810
Mom.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,780
Please, breathe.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,520
Breathe!

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,320
Mom!

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,570
Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,970
From now on, this baby is mine.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,340
I said she's my baby now!

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,670
Like this?

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,140
Just tell me what I have to do.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,080
If you had just stayed away
from Dong Seok,

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,520
things wouldn't have gotten so twisted.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,020
Your very existence is a sin.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,430
Please...

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,610
You're asking me what you can do?

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,540
That's the only way!

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,810
Lock them both in the warehouse.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,410
Get rid of them after dark.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,320
Is this my punishment
for what I did to your mother?

21
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,190
Is my son, Ha Neul, paying for my sins...

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,530
by getting leukemia?

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,500
No, that's ridiculous.

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,100
Right. I only did what had to be done.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
Mom.

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,520
Take a deep breath. Okay?

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,020
Slowly, breathe in and breathe out.

28
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,690
Mom.

29
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,590
Can you hear me?

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,790
Mom, I'm right here.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,960
It's me, your daughter, Jang Mi.
You remember me, right?

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,470
Slowly, breathe in and breathe out.

33
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,700
You're okay.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
You're okay.

35
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,040
Your daughter, Jang Mi, is right here.
Don't be scared, okay?

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,190
<i>When Mommy's in the island's shade</i>

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,790
<i>Gathering oysters from the sea</i>

38
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,960
<i>Baby is left all alone</i>

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,340
<i>And watches the house alone</i>

40
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,210
<i>The sea sings</i>

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,850
<i>A lullaby</i>

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,390
Mom.

43
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,790
Jang Mi.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,130
- Jang Mi.
- Yes, your daughter Jang Mi is here.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,570
My dear mom.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,740
I love you, Mom. You're okay.

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
You're okay.

48
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
Jang Mi.

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
You're okay.

50
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,450
You're okay.

51
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,950
Looks like your lullaby
was the perfect cure for your mom.

52
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,990
What a relief.

53
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,890
I'm sorry. About my mom...

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
You must have been really startled.

55
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,830
- This sort of thing happens sometimes.
- I was actually quite moved.

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,730
Seeing you comfort your mother
and put her to bed,

57
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,330
it was like you were the mom.

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,070
When I saw that, you seemed
way more grown-up than me.

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,640
Then you better take good care of me.

60
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,940
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

61
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,410
But seriously, did something happen
with your mother today?

62
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,380
- Why do you ask?
- I was just wondering...

63
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,650
if something triggered a memory,

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,220
or if she experienced something
out of the ordinary.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Not that I can think of.

66
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,690
When an event like that occurs,
it can sometimes cause hyperventilation.

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,360
Nothing, other than going
to the Dream Hotel with her today.

68
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,170
The Dream Hotel?

69
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,820
Tok Hee.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,390
It's Tok Hee.

71
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,690
Tok Hee.

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,340
Mrs. Yang.

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,310
Get me another drink.

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,540
Hi.

75
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,480
The kind of fashion
that I, Ma Seo Rin, adore...

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,580
My gosh...

77
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
For goodness' sake.

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,430
You just woke up. What is all this?

79
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,930
Shit.

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,570
Suddenly, I'm so depressed.

81
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,170
I can't even use social media
because of my mom,

82
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,610
and I can't do a single thing
I want to do.

83
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,510
Mrs. Yang.
You think I'm miserable too, don't you?

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,510
- Right?
- Don't be ridiculous.

85
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
What?

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,550
If I say I'm miserable, then I am.

87
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,150
How much longer
do I have to live like this?

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,960
How much longer?

89
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,960
This is so boring.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,700
Shit.

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,230
Even if someone loses their memory,
maybe the really important things...

92
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,370
stay in their subconscious.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,470
Who lost their memory?

94
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,710
Jang Mi's mother.

95
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,150
Don't tell me you're talking
about that woman again.

96
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,680
I can't believe this.
After everything I told you.

97
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,390
Dad, I told you she's not like that.
You don't even know her.

98
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,820
Please don't talk about her like that.

99
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,090
She's such an admirable woman.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
"Admirable?"

101
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,030
Oh my goodness, look at the way he talks!

102
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,870
- Honey.
- He's completely smitten.

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,470
Seriously, what's there to admire?

104
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,240
What if you're right? What if Baek Ho
is seeing some strange woman?

105
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,910
No, this won't do.

106
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,310
I must meet her and see what she's like.

107
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,580
If she's not the one,
I'll have to separate Baek Ho from her.

108
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,980
If I just let this go,
it's going to be a disaster.

109
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,220
Especially Baek Ho
is so compassionate and soft-hearted.

110
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,390
If a truly bad woman
sets her sights on him,

111
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,790
he'll fall for it hook, line, and sinker.

112
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,160
Mom!

113
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,360
Why have you already decided
that Jang Mi is a bad person?

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,660
She runs her own side dish shop...

115
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,500
and takes such good care of her family
and her mom.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
She runs a side dish shop?

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
Come on, you clueless kid.

118
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,940
Anyway, Kang Baek Ho!
If she's as wonderful as you say,

119
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,340
then I really need to meet her
and see for myself.

120
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,410
What? Why would you meet her?

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,450
Jang Mi and I aren't even
in a serious relationship yet.

122
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,920
You're clearly head over heels for her,

123
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,660
- and you're not even dating yet?
- Jang Mi doesn't even know I like her!

124
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,060
Wait, I guess I really do like her.

125
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,630
What are you talking about, Baek Ho?

126
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm home.

127
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,010
- What's going on in here?
- Jun Ho, about Jang Mi...

128
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,180
- Her again? What is it now?
- The reason she missed her interview...

129
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,150
I don't know the exact reason,

130
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,750
but I'm sure it has something to do
with CEO Chae.

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,690
What do you mean?
You're saying it was because of CEO Chae?

132
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,060
Yes, she said she couldn't tell me why.
She promised to keep it a secret.

133
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,130
- You're making less and less sense.
- Anyway,

134
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,700
Jang Mi is not the type of person
to break a promise.

135
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,730
She must have had an unavoidable reason...

136
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,300
involving CEO Chae
for missing that interview.

137
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,740
So, what I'm saying is,
you should give Jang Mi...

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,310
another chance to work
at Chang Restaurant. Please?

139
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,510
I've heard enough.

140
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,750
Don't ever bring it up again.

141
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,410
Come on, Jun Ho!

142
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
What should I do?

143
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,690
Right.

144
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,230
I'll be honest and tell her
that Chef Kang Jun Ho is my brother,

145
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,270
and we can figure out a plan together.

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,640
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,230
Please retrieve your item.
Thank you very much.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,660
(Daehan Bank)

149
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,240
Maybe I shouldn't have brought
this tote bag.

150
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,610
I should've brought my crossbody bag.

151
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,010
What?

152
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,320
Hello, Baek Ho.

153
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,290
Where are you? I'm here at your shop.

154
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,620
If you're awake, come on out.
I'll be waiting out front.

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,920
Why are you here so late?
You just went back home.

156
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,590
Because I felt like it.

157
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,730
So, are you telling me to just go home?

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,700
Who told you to just go home?

159
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm at the bank right now.

160
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,230
The bank? What for at this hour?

161
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,140
I have to pay Bo Ra's preschool tuition
tomorrow.

162
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,240
Okay, then just stay put.
I'll come to you.

163
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
No, don't come all the way here.
We can just meet halfway.

164
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,010
You're being stubborn again.
Anyway, I'm heading over.

165
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,530
Yes. I suppose so.

166
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,780
(Name: Park Soon Sun)

167
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Yes.

168
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,550
That man...

169
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,220
I think he looks like that criminal.

170
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,090
What should I do?

171
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,360
I need to get a closer look.

172
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,110
Wait a second. Where did he disappear to?

173
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,110
I'm scared.

174
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,280
Should I just turn back?

175
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,220
- Get over here.
- Who are you?

176
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,860
- Get in, now!
- Somebody help me!

177
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,840
How dare you...

178
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,840
Get over here.

179
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,210
Jang Mi?

180
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,380
Jang Mi!

181
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Stop right there!

182
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,770
Jang Mi!

183
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Jang Mi!

184
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Jang Mi!

185
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Jang Mi!

186
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,110
Jang Mi!

187
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Jang Mi!

188
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,710
Chairman, these greens are seasoned
just right. They're delicious.

189
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,310
Here, have a bite.

190
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,980
Seo Rin, you don't look very well.

191
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,910
Did you sleep poorly last night?

192
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,850
Don't even get me started.
I had the most horrible nightmare.

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,550
- I barely made it out alive.
- Horrible?

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,360
What a terrible thing to say.
What if the dream was a premonition?

195
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,130
- A premonition?
- Exactly.

196
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,800
It shows you events from the future...

197
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,530
so you can prevent them.

198
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,800
I can interpret it for you,
so tell me about it.

199
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,640
- So what was it about?
- Stop trying to be an expert. Just eat.

200
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,940
Come on, Mom. It's fun.

201
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,280
Besides, the dream left me feeling uneasy.

202
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,980
Okay, so in my dream,

203
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,850
I saw someone who had my face
but didn't feel like me,

204
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,420
and she was falling
from somewhere up high.

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,990
And I couldn't breathe.

206
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,460
So it was like,
"It's me, but it's not me..."

207
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,220
"It felt like me..."

208
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,760
"It wasn't you, but me?"

209
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,290
What is that supposed to mean?

210
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,400
Anyway, let me finish.

211
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,130
Then all of a sudden,
I was going somewhere...

212
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,600
and these two thugs tried to grab me,

213
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,670
I tried to run away,

214
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,740
but my feet felt like they were glued
to the ground. It was so frustrating.

215
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,270
- Oh, my, that definitely means...
- Means what?

216
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,780
Don't make a fuss
over some nonsense dream.

217
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,180
My dear Seo Rin, have you been
under a lot of stress lately?

218
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,180
To be having nightmares like that...

219
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,790
Grandpa, I was so scared.

220
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,320
I even kept calling out your name
in the dream.

221
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,360
Oh, my. You did?

222
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,360
That dream is definitely...

223
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,530
just a nonsense dream.

224
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,340
Trying to run but your feet won't move?
That's just a classic nonsense dream.

225
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,410
I have dreams like that sometimes too,
Seo Rin.

226
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,410
Seriously...

227
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,840
You're ridiculous.

228
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,050
The good news from the tests
is that there's no head injury,

229
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,590
just a minor sprain in her right ankle.

230
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,060
There's no ligament damage.

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,820
So it's not life-threatening, right?

232
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,960
That's right. She'll be fine
with a few days of physical therapy.

233
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,730
We gave her a sedative,

234
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,800
so she should feel better
after a good night's sleep.

235
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,300
Thank you, Jang Mi.

236
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Jang Mi.

237
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,110
I...

238
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,580
I think I have feelings for you.

239
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
No.

240
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
I do like you.

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,920
I like you, Jang Mi.

242
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,400
Jang Mi.

243
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,760
Are you awake?

244
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,100
Are you feeling any better?

245
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,500
- Please help me!
- It's me.

246
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,700
Jang Mi, it's me.

247
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,510
It's me, Jang Mi.

248
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
You're okay.

249
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,080
You're okay now.

250
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,710
- Help me.
- You're okay.

251
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,750
You're okay.

252
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,550
You're safe now.

253
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,850
You're okay.

254
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,430
You don't have to be scared anymore.

255
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,660
You're okay.

256
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,630
You're okay.

257
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,100
You must have been so terrified.

258
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,140
I thought I was going to lose you.

259
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,310
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

260
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,950
But I'm so glad that you're safe.

261
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,020
I'm so, so grateful.

262
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,750
Thank you, Jang Mi.

263
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,690
Baek Ho.

264
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Baek Ho.

265
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,300
What? Jang Mi's awake?

266
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,810
That's such a relief. Thank goodness.

267
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,640
Tae Sook was just about to...

268
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,810
pack some things
for her to use at the hospital...

269
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,280
What? She'll be discharged today?

270
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,820
Okay. Thank you, Lawyer Kang.

271
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,020
- Is Jang Mi okay?
- She's getting discharged today?

272
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,830
Thankfully, she wasn't seriously hurt.
It's a miracle, really.

273
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,330
So that's Lawyer Kang Baek Ho's office,
then?

274
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,770
Thanks, Ju Ri. I owe you big time.

275
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,840
Owe her for what?

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Never mind, Mom. You don't need to know.

277
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,980
Listen,

278
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,780
don't you dare get your head turned
by some strange lawyer.

279
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,450
You will marry
the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals,

280
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,890
no matter what.

281
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,160
Mom, this youngest son of Jinan Chemicals,

282
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,190
I've never even laid eyes on the guy.
How am I supposed to marry him?

283
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,730
Do you know how hard
it was trying to find him?

284
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,960
It was like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

285
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,530
Hong Ju, it's no wonder
you couldn't find him last time.

286
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,070
The photo I showed you before
was ten years old.

287
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,370
Look. This is him now.

288
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,610
Isn't he handsome?
He looks so well-fed and prosperous!

289
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,280
See? That plump belly is
where he keeps all his good fortune.

290
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,480
"Plump belly?" Please.

291
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,990
He's a middle-aged man with a beer gut,

292
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,360
- and he's bald.
- Are his looks going to pay the bills?

293
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,390
With a man, money is all that matters.
You naive girl.

294
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,700
Have you forgotten how much
we've suffered without money?

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,070
After my divorce,
I raised you all by myself,

296
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,840
enduring all sorts of humiliation,

297
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,410
- and I lived just for you.
- There you go again.

298
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,410
Alright, that's enough.
I'm sick of hearing this broken record.

299
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,010
Just do as I wish,
marry into a rich family,

300
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,920
and give a healthy, chubby grandson.

301
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,250
Then it'll only be a matter of time
before we take over Dream, you silly girl.

302
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,900
They say his dad is a professor
and his mom is a lawyer.

303
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,770
Lawyer Kang Baek Ho was a huge hit
with the ladies back in law school.

304
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm not sure if he's still single, though.

305
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,740
I finally meet the man of my dreams,

306
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,010
and I can't just give up on him like this.

307
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,720
I mean, we could just date, right?

308
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,790
It's not like you marry everyone
you date, right?

309
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,800
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

310
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,540
Yes, this is Lawyer Kang Baek Ho's office.

311
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,670
Hi, is Lawyer Kang Baek Ho available?

312
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,140
I'm sorry, he seems to be
out of the office at the moment.

313
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,210
I see.

314
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,220
Do you have any idea when he'll be back?

315
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,490
I'm not sure.
May I ask what this is regarding?

316
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,050
Excuse me,

317
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,160
but are you Ms. Jang Mi, by any chance?

318
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,420
Excuse me? Jang Mi?

319
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,260
Sorry, my mistake.

320
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,330
If you're calling about a case,
I can help you with that.

321
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,870
No, thank you. There's something
I need to discuss...

322
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,500
with Lawyer Kang Baek Ho personally.

323
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,970
Is Lawyer Kang at the courthouse?
Or are there any places he frequents?

324
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,810
He doesn't have
any court appearances today.

325
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,210
Maybe he went to that side dish place?

326
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,020
A side dish shop?

327
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,720
Never mind.

328
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,160
Who should I say called when he gets back?

329
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,760
That's all right. I'll call back later.
Thank you.

330
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,690
Hello?

331
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
What was that about?

332
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,170
Seriously, a side dish shop?

333
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,830
What kind of guy
goes to a side dish place?

334
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,270
Here, have something sweet.

335
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,510
You need your strength so you can go back
to being your usual feisty self.

336
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,810
Try this.

337
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,610
Open up.

338
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,620
There you go. Look at you, eating so well.

339
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,050
I told you to stay at the bank.
Why did you go down a deserted alley?

340
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,860
I already told the detective everything.

341
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,960
The man with the scar.

342
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,230
Ssangkal, or whatever his name is,

343
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,130
he suddenly walked right past me,
so I chased after him,

344
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,570
and that's how I ended up there.

345
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,170
Ssangkal definitely lured you there.

346
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,740
It's so strange. Why would he target me?

347
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,510
Did he somehow smell
the thousand dollars I had?

348
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,610
No.

349
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,250
I don't think it was about the money.

350
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,480
You've been in one dangerous situation
after another lately.

351
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,150
There's definitely something else going on
that we don't know about.

352
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,060
Who on earth would do this, and why?

353
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,090
Tell those goons to disappear
before they get caught!

354
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,530
- Yes. I've already taken care of it.
- When are you ever going to get it right?

355
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,540
Or does Oh Jang Mi have nine lives
or something?

356
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,970
Why is she so annoyingly resilient,
like a weed?

357
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,980
- This is such a headache.
- I'm sorry.

358
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,180
But I was sure it was foolproof this time.

359
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,450
Shut up!

360
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Oh Jang Mi.

361
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,050
No matter how many times I stomp her out,
she just keeps coming back.

362
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,660
What do I have to do
to get rid of her for good?

363
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,690
I'll come up with another plan.

364
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,930
I can't stand the sight of you. Get out!

365
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,700
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

366
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,520
Hello? It's me.

367
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,250
Have you found anything?

368
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,190
What did you just say?

369
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,100
You're saying my Ha Neul was adopted?

370
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,270
So he's definitely alive then.

371
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,870
- Where was he adopted to?
- Taean, in Chungnam Province.

372
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm texting you the address now.

373
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,180
Okay. Send it to me right away.

374
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,150
(154-2, Muho-ri, Gojang-myeon, Taean-gun)

375
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,790
This is near that villa from 30 years ago.

376
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,330
Then that means Ha Neul was adopted
to that area, and while he was playing,

377
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,870
he must have dropped this hair clip.

378
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,440
And Jung Suk Hee must have been the one
who picked it up.

379
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,170
I can't just stand around like this.

380
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,290
How long are you going to keep this up?

381
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,560
You're distracting me from my work,
so please leave.

382
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,700
I don't want to.

383
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm happy just watching you.

384
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,600
Director Ma, how old are you, anyway?

385
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,670
Don't you know that pestering someone
who isn't interested makes you a stalker?

386
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,740
I don't care.

387
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,650
Chef Kang, so I'm finally starting to
get to you?

388
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,810
Bravo!

389
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,320
See? It's true what they say.

390
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,650
"Constant dripping wears away the stone."

391
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,430
Jang Mi's here! You look so beautiful.

392
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,970
Mom, I'm okay.
You must have been so worried.

393
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,800
- Dad.
- Hey, Jang Mi.

394
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,070
My dear daughter.
I'm so relieved it wasn't worse.

395
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,470
- Thank you, Lawyer Kang.
- Don't mention it.

396
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,940
Are you sure you shouldn't be lying down?

397
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,610
Tae Pyung, I said I'm fine.

398
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,850
Where did you go
without telling me, ma'am?

399
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,090
That's none of your business.

400
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,510
There you are, Chef Kang.
Are you done with service?

401
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,810
I've been waiting forever.

402
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,510
You're still here?

403
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,120
Are you going to just sit there
with your chin in your hands all day?

404
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,250
Yes.

405
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,090
Watching you is what I live for, Jun Ho.

406
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,830
What?

407
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,240
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

408
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,480
The child some man named Chun Sik adopted
got leukemia,

409
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,850
and he sent the kid back,
saying it would cost too much.

410
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,550
After that, there was no way
the family would prosper, was there?

411
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,760
Then one night, he and his family just up
and skipped town. Can you believe it?

412
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,590
Ha Neul.

413
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,900
Where am I supposed to find you?

414
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,380
Who are you calling?

415
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,650
My Ha Neul was treated for leukemia?

416
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,320
If he was treated,
that means he has to be alive.

417
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,090
He has to be. I must find him,
no matter what.

418
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,220
My son.

419
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,400
Hello, this is Chae Hwa Young.

420
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Ma'am.

421
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,500
Please, get Director Ma out of my sight.

422
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
Who?

423
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Kang Jun Ho?

424
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,580
How rude.

425
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,050
I think the rude one is Director Ma,
sitting here gawking at me.

426
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,080
She's a distraction.
Please, just come and get her.

427
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
That's all.

428
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,220
That insolent brat!

429
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,530
But did you really have to call my mom
over it?

430
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,100
Okay, message received.

431
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,570
It'll just be a scene if my mom shows up,
so I'll get out of your hair for today.

432
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,270
See you.

433
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,060
Kang Jun Ho!

434
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,960
Who do you think you are,
telling me what to do with my daughter?

435
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,020
(The First Man)

436
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,090
What's that?

437
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,960
- What are you doing?
- What do those numbers mean?

438
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,590
As you wished,

439
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I will give serious thought to resigning.

440
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
What's this?

441
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,170
It's a lucky hippo.
Think of me whenever you look at it.

442
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,770
It's about Chef Kang Jun Ho.

443
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,470
Have you seen the tattoo on his neck?

444
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,840
He said it's his date of birth.

445
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,710
You have two sons?

446
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,680
What does your other son do?

447
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,810
