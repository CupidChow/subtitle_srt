1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,610
Tae Pyung. What did you say about Mom?

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,640
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,340
What?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,080
Don't tell me she got lost again.

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,680
How could you let this happen?

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,620
I thought I told you
not to let Mom go out alone!

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,230
Where is Jang Mi?

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,430
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,930
For crying out loud...

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,530
I have to get to Jang Mi.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,100
Jang Mi!

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,710
I just want to see my Jang Mi.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,480
Where is she?
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,350
- What's her problem?
- What's going on over there?

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,550
Will you get out of my way?

16
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,880
You crazy old hag, what is wrong with you?

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,750
It looks like there was an accident.

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,690
Let go of me.

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,160
- I said let go.
- It looks like a fight's breaking out.

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,990
I have to get to Jang Mi.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,360
- Take me to her! Please, take me.
- What is wrong with you?

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,770
Take me to Jang Mi.

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,170
- I said let go!
- Take me to Jang Mi.

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,010
(Chairman)

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,910
Yes, Father.

26
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,310
Seo Rin?

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes. I heard
he returned from Paris yesterday.

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,080
Why is it so hard for me
to get a look at my own granddaughter?

29
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,890
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Where's Jang Mi?

30
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,620
It seems Seo Rin
is at the department store...

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,960
to buy you a present.

32
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Seo Rin should be home any minute now.

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,790
Jang Mi! Let's go find Jang Mi!

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,470
- Let's go!
- Let me go!

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,470
She was at that park last time, remember?

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,840
Go check there.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm on my way.

38
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,780
Call me if anything happens.

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,470
Am I at the department store?

40
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,610
No, Mom. I'm at home right now.

41
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,010
Gosh, she can lie without batting an eye.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Anyway, where could Mom have gone?

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,590
I hope she's okay.

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,170
Are you really home?

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,500
Perfect. If you're home,
get changed and come out.

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,110
We have to let everyone know you're back.

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,410
I literally just got back.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,850
- Let's deal with that later, Mom.
- Later?

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,020
Fine. I guess it wouldn't hurt
to take it slow.

50
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,890
But don't you dare back out of this later.

51
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,660
Who does she take after,
lying so shamelessly like that?

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
It's just one thing after another.

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,730
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure Seo Rin has her reasons.

54
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,430
Reasons? Please.

55
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,270
If she had a thought in her head,
she'd have visited yesterday on returning.

56
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,100
And she decides to come home reluctantly
after messing around who knows where?

57
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,340
She's at the age
where she just wants to have fun.

58
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,540
And you.
Are you Seo Rin's father or something?

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,580
Stop acting like you're her father.
It's not your place.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,850
Yes. I understand.

61
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,620
I'm moving up the date of Seo Rin's
official succession announcement.

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,730
But she isn't ready to take over,
and her leadership is untested.

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,090
Are you sure that's wise?

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
She has me.

65
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,500
I've worked day and night for Dream Group
for the last 30 years.

66
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,100
With me backing Ma Seo Rin,
who would dare to oppose her?

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,570
Well, there are many people backing you.

68
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,440
There probably won't be much opposition.

69
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,190
Taxi!

70
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,130
What?

71
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,960
- Excuse me. I flagged him first.
- Hey, what are you talking about?

72
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,100
The driver saw me waving from over there
and stopped for me.

73
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,570
What?

74
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,310
- I waved first and got this cab.
- I'm telling you, I was first.

75
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,140
- Are you going to let go or not?
- I'm not letting go.

76
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,010
- I was here first. Why steal my cab?
- Steal your cab?

77
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,450
I'm telling you, I got this cab first!

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,890
Here, look.

79
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,420
Since I grabbed it first,
my hand is right on the handle,

80
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,820
and your hand is on top of mine. See?

81
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,990
What do you mean my hand
is on top of yours?

82
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,190
They're side by side.

83
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,530
Just get in, one of you.
Are you going to argue all day?

84
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,100
- Goodness, thanks a lot.
- Oh, my.

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,010
So you're just going to be a coward
and use brute force?

86
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,080
Why would you call me a coward?
I can't stand being called that.

87
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,450
I was simply following
the natural order of things.

88
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,160
That's not what that means,
and you know it.

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Look, whatever.

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,130
I'm too busy to stand here
and argue with you.

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,760
Seriously? Why else would you take a cab
if you weren't busy?

92
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,930
I'm in a huge hurry too.
That's the whole point of taking a cab.

93
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,900
Gosh, I'm this close to punching him.

94
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,080
Sir, I'm in a real hurry.
Can you please step on it?

95
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,940
Okay, where to?

96
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,140
- The Seonhwa Flower Market.
- Hangang-dong.

97
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,580
Excuse me, you both spoke at once,
so I couldn't hear you. One at a time.

98
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,820
- Hangang-dong.
- The Seonhwa Flower Market.

99
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,250
- Gosh.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

100
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,490
I said one at a time!
Miss, where did you say you were going?

101
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,760
The Seonhwa Flower Market.

102
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,260
- And you, sir?
- Sir, drop by the Hangang Law Office,

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,570
and then head to Jungjin-dong.

104
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,270
Okay, we'll drop the lady off first,
and then you, sir. That's perfect.

105
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,740
- Great, please hurry.
- Wait, sir.

106
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,170
You've got to be kidding me.

107
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,130
- Take me to Jang Mi.
- I said let go!

108
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,530
- Come on.
- Hey, get off!

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,400
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!

110
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,600
Let's go!

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
That's strange.

112
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,840
I feel like I've seen that face
somewhere before.

113
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
Who was that?

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You're just getting home?

115
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,820
Wait, why is Assistant Manager Jin
carrying your bags?

116
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,590
Director Ma called me from the airport,
so I went to pick her up.

117
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,170
Assistant Manager Jin is like my servant.
Mom, why would you even ask that?

118
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,800
- Where's Grandpa?
- He's in his study. Go say hello first.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
Thank you for your help,
Assistant Manager Jin.

120
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,040
It was my pleasure.
I'll be on my way, then.

121
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,980
Seo Rin!

122
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,710
Grandpa!

123
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,450
- Grandpa, did you miss me?
- Of course I did. Let me look at you.

124
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,160
Here, look.
I've gotten even prettier, haven't I?

125
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,430
You're more beautiful than ever.
How long has it been since I saw you?

126
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,530
If you keep getting prettier like this,
you'll make your old grandpa worry.

127
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,830
What? Why?

128
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,200
I'm worried enough as it is.
Get prettier, and the boys will swarm you.

129
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,510
They'll all be flocking to you
and making a fuss.

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,410
Don't worry, Grandpa.
I'll marry whoever you choose.

131
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,650
- Really?
- Of course.

132
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,780
I mean it.

133
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,050
Based on the way Seo Rin acts,

134
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,860
she's not a complete airhead.

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Ma Seo Rin.

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
Me? Your servant?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,470
You do nothing but fool around all day.

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,270
Who do you think you are
to treat me like that?

139
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,510
What have you ever accomplished
on your own?

140
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,940
All you did was be born his granddaughter
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

141
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,190
Since we shared the cab,
I'll pay the fare.

142
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,060
Just my half.

143
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Half?

144
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,430
Forget it, just get out.

145
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,730
Sir, please just charge me for half.

146
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,340
Look, you were trying to pull a fast one
to get a free ride.

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,800
Now you're embarrassed,
so you're just acting.

148
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,040
Just go.

149
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,280
- I'll write this off as stepping in poop.
- Excuse me? Poop?

150
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,550
Gosh, I can't believe this guy.
Are you finished?

151
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,650
Hurry up and get out.

152
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,350
Come on, sir.

153
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,080
I said, just charge me for half the fare.

154
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,390
Look, it's a real hassle
to split the fare on the meter.

155
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,460
Just work it out between the two of you.

156
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,930
So you insist on paying a few dollars
just to feel good about yourself?

157
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,970
Listen here, you narrow-minded jerk.

158
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,170
I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this quick.
Try practicing three virtues in your life.

159
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,540
Consideration, humility, and kindness.
Got it?

160
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,710
- Stop living like that.
- Yes, right back at you.

161
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,250
Here.

162
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,090
Here. I've officially paid my share,
so use this to pay for the rest.

163
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,690
Thank you.

164
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,890
This woman is unbelievable.
Fine, if you're so desperate to pay.

165
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,390
Great. I got five dollars.

166
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,330
I can't believe her.

167
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,710
What is wrong with her?

168
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,550
- Dad, where's Mom?
- Jang Mi, let's go.

169
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
What?

170
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,490
We just got a call
from the police station.

171
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
What did you say?

172
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,600
- Mom!
- Suk Hee.

173
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,370
- Mom!
- My Jang Mi's here. It's my Jang Mi.

174
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,470
Look at what I'm eating now.

175
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,710
- Jang Mi.
- Mom. Thank goodness.

176
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,440
- Mom, are you hurt anywhere?
- No.

177
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,550
Thank you so much.

178
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

179
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,180
Thank you.

180
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,690
Suk Hee says thank you too.

181
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,160
That's right, Mom. You're very good at it.

182
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,630
Who bought you this?
Did the police officer get it for you?

183
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Suk Hee was crying
because she wanted to see Jang Mi.

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,530
- That officer gave it to me.
- Goodness.

185
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,370
- We're so grateful for all your help.
- Thank you.

186
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,210
- I missed my Jang Mi.
- Goodness.

187
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm sorry, Mom.

188
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,150
I'm sorry, Mom.

189
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,890
From now on, I'll stay right by your side
so you won't have to look for me.

190
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,750
- Okay?
- Yes.

191
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,930
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,700
I'm so sorry.

193
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

194
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,470
Gosh.

195
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,210
Don't overdo it just because you're upset.
You'll have a rough day tomorrow.

196
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,680
What?

197
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,010
I've already had
more than half the bottle.

198
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,120
I'd better listen to my girl.

199
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,350
Don't be too upset.

200
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,620
- It's not the first time Mom's done this.
- You're right.

201
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,090
Is your mom asleep?

202
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Yes.

203
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,230
She must have had a rough day.

204
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,500
Of course she did.

205
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,870
Imagine how scared she must have been,
getting lost like that.

206
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,670
It's a good thing someone called it in.

207
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Tell me about it.

208
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,750
Every time I see your mom like this,
my blood just boils.

209
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,750
To think that Suk Hee,
who was so smart and brilliant,

210
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,550
ended up like this.

211
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,560
And whoever did this to your mom...

212
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,690
If I ever find them,

213
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,760
I'll chase them to the ends
of the fiery pit and make them pay.

214
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,140
What now?

215
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,010
Why would you tell me an obvious lie?

216
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,380
- What are you talking about?
- You said you were home when we spoke.

217
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,310
How could you lie about being home
when you weren't even here?

218
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,520
- Is that what's important right now?
- What did you say?

219
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,660
Isn't the important thing
whether I paid my respects to Grandpa?

220
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,230
Don't worry.
I'm going to be the one taking over Dream.

221
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,700
Look at how you talk.
You think you can walk all over me?

222
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,870
Why pick a fight you can't win?
That's not like you.

223
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Seriously, though.

224
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,200
Are you really that confident
you can take over Dream?

225
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Confident?

226
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,010
Dream is going to be mine anyway.
What's confidence got to do with it?

227
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,040
Whether I'm just the director...

228
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,450
of Food and Beverage at Dream Hotel
in name only...

229
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,050
and spend a few months gallivanting
around the world,

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,150
or work myself to the bone over there,

231
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,850
it's going to be mine,

232
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,320
- no matter what.
- Ma Seo Rin.

233
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Am I wrong?

234
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,760
- Mom, what are you so worried about?
- Stop being so naive and reckless.

235
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,830
Even if you are
Chairman's one and only granddaughter,

236
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,770
that's not how the business
and world work, you naive child.

237
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,610
Do you think the board of directors
will just let that slide?

238
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,140
Even as we speak,

239
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,450
countless wolves are eyeing your position,
just waiting for their chance to strike.

240
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,780
And you can afford to be so complacent?

241
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,880
Right. You think the sky is falling.
I'm surprised you can even walk.

242
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,720
Seriously...

243
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,590
Mark my words!

244
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,230
Hong Ju, have you had dinner?

245
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,500
If you haven't, I can fix you something.

246
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,240
Who eats dinner every single night?
I need to go on a diet.

247
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,040
Goodness, listen to you.

248
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,640
With a figure like yours, what's to lose?
Stop harping on about a diet.

249
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,850
Keep this up, and you'll get osteoporosis
while you're still young.

250
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,180
Mom.

251
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,480
Why are you still living like this?

252
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,980
- What?
- I'm asking...

253
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,150
why you still live like this.
Why are you always stuck in one place?

254
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,760
- Why, you little...
- What does Seo Rin have that I don't?

255
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,160
All she ever did was be born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

256
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,400
But I clawed my way up to where I am.
All by myself.

257
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,640
- I know.
- So do something to help me.

258
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,770
Seo Rin is humiliating me,
and it's driving me insane.

259
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,810
She treats me like her personal slave.
But her spot...

260
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
could have been my spot, you know?

261
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,350
- Seo Rin humiliated you again?
- And when is it ever any different?

262
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,550
Seo Rin has done nothing on her own merit.

263
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,520
And yet, she treats me like something
she scraped off her shoe.

264
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,220
She orders me around
like I'm her personal maid.

265
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,930
The nerve of her.

266
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,460
All right.

267
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,370
Just you wait.

268
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,090
No! Give me back my baby! No!

269
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,560
- No!
- Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

270
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,630
From now on, this baby is mine.
I said she's my baby now!

271
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,330
Ma Seo Rin.

272
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,870
Don't forget
that you owe everything you have to me.

273
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,940
So from now on,

274
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,140
I won't forgive any more of your lies.

275
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,280
Let's give a warm welcome to Kang Jun Ho,
returning triumphantly from the U.S!

276

00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,150
- Kang Jun Ho.
- Kang Jun Ho.

00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,520
- Kang Jun Ho.
- Kang Jun Ho.

279
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,760
Kang Jun Ho.

280
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,660
Welcome to Korea.

281
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,330
- Welcome home.
- Gosh, I told you not to do all this.

282
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,140
You just don't get it, do you?
We do this so Mom and Dad won't be lonely,

283
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,570
and it makes the house feel more alive.
Right?

284
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,810
Right. Baek Ho has a point.

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,110
Let me get a look at you, my eldest.

286
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,280
The U.S. must have been good for you.
You're glowing.

287
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,680
Hey, man. How about we say hello,
American style?

288
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,320
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

289
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,360
Come on.

290
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,270
- Jun Ho, you're back for good, right?
- Yes, Dad.

291
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,530
Jun Ho, congratulations
on being the head chef...

292
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,740
at the Dream Hotel restaurant.

293
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,270
Congratulations
from the bottom of my heart.

294
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,470
Here's a present to celebrate.

295
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,910
What? Why's this so light?

296
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
You shouldn't have.

297
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,410
It was a sure thing.

298
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
Was that a gift for Jun Ho?

299
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,020
You're pulling a prank, aren't you?

300
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,690
What are you talking about?

301
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,230
- What?
- I already wore it.

302
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,830
You did, Mom?

303
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,730
It's lingerie.
Why buy lingerie for your brother?

304
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,510
Oh my.

305
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,380
To think my Baek Ho
would even buy his mother underwear.

306
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,950
He's all grown up.

307
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,630
I just assumed you bought it for me,
so of course I wore it.

308
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,600
And it was a perfect fit.

309
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,770
I was just saying what a good eye
you have for these things.

310
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,400
- Mom!
- What?

311
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
What's going on?
Wasn't that a gift for your mother?

312
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,540
- It looked nice on her.
- No, that's not...

313
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,610
- I think the bags got switched.
- What? Switched with whose?

314
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,450
What?

315
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,780
Nevermind, Mom.

316
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,980
That's right. It was your gift.

I'm sure it's a lipstick.

328
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,430
- Jang Mi got me a lipstick last year too.
- It's different, Mom.

329
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,770
Open it.

330
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,480
This is...

331
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
What?

This is...

Oh, no, what is this?

334
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,020
That scared me!

335
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,390
What is this?

336
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,360
- Look at this.
- Mom!

337
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,760
What is this? Oh Jang Mi, did you
really get Mom that for her birthday?

338
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,460
- That's not what I got her.
- Bok Gil, look what Jang Mi bought me.

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,700
Goodness. It looks like...

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,900
Jang Mi really nailed your taste, Suk Hee.

341
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,110
That's weird. No, this can't be right.

342
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,040
What now?

343
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,350
- Here.
- What?

344
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,310
Look.

345
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,580
It's an elephant!

346
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,250
<i>Mr. Elephant's nose is his hand</i>

347
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,030
<i>Give him a snack, he'll use his nose</i>

348
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,290
Hey, Oh Jang Mi.

349
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,300
<i>- He eats it with his nose</i>
- Is this really for Mom?

350
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,560
No.

351
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,430
I think they got switched.

352
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,870
That's not her gift.
Mom's was something really pretty!

353
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,580
Darn it. I can't believe that guy.

354
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,550
How am I going to switch this back
with that woman?

355
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,790
Tae Pyung would love this.

356
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,040
Father, Seo Rin is back
from her training abroad.

357
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,340
- She's returning to work starting today.
- Is she?

358
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,440
Grandpa, you must be bored.

359
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,550
How about I skip work and we go on a date?
It's been a while.

360
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,650
Seo Rin, this is no time for jokes.

361
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,150
Did you forget that your grandfather
is the chairman of Dream Group?

362
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,220
When does he ever have time to be bored?

363
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,020
Stop talking nonsense and let's go.

364
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,220
We'll be heading out now, Father.

365
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,690
I'm off, Grandpa.

366
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,030
All right. Don't overdo it
on your first day back.

367
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,300
Okay.

368
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,470
Chairman.

369
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,610
What brings you here?

370
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,750
I just saw CEO Chae on her way out.

371
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,580
Ma'am.

372
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,920
- Please prepare this for Chairman.
- Yes, ma'am.

373
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,290
What's that?

374
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,490
It's ripe persimmons. Your favorite.

375
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,000
Hwa Young won't let me eat that.
She says it'll spike my blood sugar.

376
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,530
I know.

377
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,800
Everyone's going crazy
over blood sugar spikes these days.

378
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,210
But I could never bring myself
to keep you from your persimmons.

379
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,580
What?

380
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,680
Don't you remember?

381
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,750
I was having a hard time with CEO Chae
and was crying in secret.

382
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,090
That's when you handed me
a ripe persimmon.

383
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,860
I did?

384
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,260
As I ate that sweet ripe persimmon,

385
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,800
I felt so incredibly comforted.

386
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,400
For me, ripe persimmons and you...

387
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,270
are two things I can't live without.

388
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,170
Goodness, what kind of thing
is that to say?

389
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,480
I asked the doctor,

390
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,650
and he said having one once in a while
is perfectly fine.

391
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,720
Here you go.

392
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,690
Go on. Here you go.

393
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,030
And taking a walk after you eat
would be the icing on the cake.

394
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,830
I've already found the perfect route.

395
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,730
Take a walk...

396
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,600
with me, Chairman.

397
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,870
Sure, a walk sounds nice.

398
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,770
- All right.
- Here.

399
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,950
Hong Ju, just you wait.

400
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,150
Mom will make sure you're born
with a silver spoon...

401
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,650
No, a diamond spoon.

402
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,830
That jerk. I swear I'll hunt him down
and make him pay.

403
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,900
And if I don't find him,
I won't be Oh Jang Mi.

404
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,330
Gosh, seriously.

405
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,940
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

406
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,470
By any chance,

407
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,810
do you remember the man
who bought this lingerie yesterday?

408
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:38,980
May I ask why?

409
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,890
Our shopping bags got switched yesterday.

410
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,450
I need to get the gift
I bought for my mom back,

411
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,560
but I have no way of contacting him
to switch them back.

412
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,790
I see.

413
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,730
Really?

414
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,430
Could I get the phone number
for his rewards account?

415
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm afraid I can't do that.
It's personal information.

416
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,710
Right. Of course it is.

417
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
Okay, then.

418
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,850
Gosh, what a mess.

419
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,820
Goodness, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

420
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,490
You're that brat from yesterday?

421
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,080
(The First Man)

422
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,510
I'll just pay for yours. How much is it?

423
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,780
- Go get my mom's gift.
- Are you crazy?

424
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,420
The reason I chose Chang Restaurant...

425
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,120
- is that it's the absolute worst.
- What? That arrogant punk.

426
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,790
If my dear Jung Suk Hee wants
a whipped cream cake...

427
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,300
Jung Suk Hee.
How could I have forgotten that name?

428
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,970
I can't let this go.
I need to return to where I last saw her.

429
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,770
