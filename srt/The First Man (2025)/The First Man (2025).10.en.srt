You're doing great!

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,590
Mom, you look like you're having fun.

<i>- I'm sorry to leave you behind</i>

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,950
What's the matter?

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,450
"What's the matter?"

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,960
Did you just ask me what's going on?

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,360
Calm down.
You have to tell me what's going on.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,330
This whole mess is happening...

19
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,630
because you didn't finish
the job properly.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,930
Has Jung Suk Hee done something?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,300
So what are you going to do now?
What are you going to do about it?

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,470
Jung Suk Hee is on her way to the villa
with her entire family.

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,480
What? The villa?

24
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,510
Yes, the villa from 30 years ago.

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,010
If she didn't remember something,

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,520
how would her family possibly know
to go there?

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120
Apparently, they go to the villa
where the accident happened every year,

28
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,090
and they're trying to find out
who did that to Jung Suk Hee.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,220
What are you going to do?
What will you do?

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,660
I told you to do your job properly!

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,830
Hold on.

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,200
Yes, it's me. Where are you?

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
You are?

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,130
So you're near Taean, then?

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,500
Keep an eye on them,

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,570
and call me the second something happens.

37
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,240
You said...

38
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,870
she regressed to a five-year-old's mind
and had amnesia,

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,910
so I was relieved.

40
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,710
But obviously, that's not the case.

41
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,680
On the slim chance she goes to that villa
and her memories start coming back,

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,820
what are we going to do then?

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,020
We'll be trapped, both you and me,

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,490
and we won't be able to escape
the attempted murder charge.

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,160
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get this far?

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,960
Dong Seok.
Is marrying me such a terrible thing?

47
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,300
Let me be perfectly clear.

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,330
I'm in love with someone else,

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,800
and I'm going to marry her.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,270
She's pregnant too?

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,770
No way.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,940
I absolutely cannot let Jung Suk Hee
meet with Chairman Ma.

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,480
Dong Seok's child...

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,840
has to be my baby. Mine alone.

55
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,050
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

56
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,650
This is where you live, is it?

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,550
You just wait.

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
- The baby had already...
- Bring him back.

59
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,990
- passed away.
- Bring him back.

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,230
Bring him back!

61
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,260
- I said, bring him back!
- My baby died because of you.

62
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,630
Because of you!

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,840
No! Give me back my baby!

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,970
No!

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,610
Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

66
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,370
From now on, this baby is mine.

67
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
I said she's my baby now!

68
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,480
I'm so close.

69
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,850
I'm so close to taking over Dream,

70
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,290
but that woman, Jung Suk Hee,
is trying to get in my way again.

71
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,820
That will never happen.

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,860
How can you be so sure?

73
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,360
Regression caused by an accident...

74
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,360
is a complex issue involving brain damage,
mental trauma, and neurological decline.

75
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,460
It's extremely difficult to treat.

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,270
And you can guarantee that?

77
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,770
The only reason
they're going to the villa...

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,940
is because she was found there.

79
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,880
There is absolutely no hope
of her getting better, so rest assured.

80
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,940
No.

81
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,610
For decades, I thought she was dead,
only to get blindsided like this.

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,980
Could you even begin to imagine that?

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,950
I can't let my guard down again.

84
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,850
You have them under surveillance, right?

85
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,320
Yes. They'll call if anything happens.

86
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,030
See? That's your problem.

87
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,660
You'll just sit around like an idiot
and wait for something to happen!

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,570
I'll prevent anything from happening.

89
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,370
I'll tighten our surveillance on them.

90
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,510
I refuse to lose anything. Ever.

91
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,250
No. I refuse to bow down to anyone.

92
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,420
Chairman Ma, that old man,
doesn't have much time left.

93
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,760
I can't keep bowing down to him forever.

94
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,160
Putting this in the space here is nice.

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,370
It's good,

96
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,370
but isn't this color
a little drab over here?

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,340
It needs a brighter feel.

98
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
This side too.

99
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,050
(Seeking witnesses)

100
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,850
(Looking for anyone who knew Jung Suk Hee,
a student at the villa from 30 years ago)

101
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,590
(Seeking witnesses)

102
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,180
(Seeking witnesses)

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,990
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

104
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,590
Are you sure that headache medicine
will be enough?

105
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,740
I heard you haven't been sleeping well
because of your insomnia.

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,810
Ma'am, it's time for your meeting.

107
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,410
Have Assistant Manager Jin
take Director Ma...

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,410
to the conference room and wait for me.

109
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,490
If by some chance things go wrong,

110
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
what we couldn't finish 30 years ago...

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
Don't worry. You should go.

112
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,130
I'll finish it.

113
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,060
I'll report back
if anything urgent comes up.

114
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,480
- Chairman, you're here.
- Where are you off to?

115
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,780
I have a meeting.

116
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,450
I'm meeting with
the Industrial Design Department...

117
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,050
to collaborate on the hotel renovation.

118
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,790
And we have to make
a final decision today.

119
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,150
I see. All right, go ahead.

120
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,560
(CEO's Office)

121
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,130
(Seeking witnesses)

122
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,340
(Looking for anyone who knew Jung Suk Hee,
a student at the villa from 30 years ago)

123
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,650
Yes, it's me.

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,550
Find out if anyone calls in a tip
about that banner.

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,860
And don't let your guard down.

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,130
I've checked the lounge bar,

127
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,400
and the break areas should be fine
as you proposed.

128
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,200
The rest of the renovations can proceed.

129
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,730
Now, that just leaves the logo.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,900
Between Option A and Option B
that you proposed, Professor,

131
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,670
we've had several meetings,
but we just can't decide.

132
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,610
Professor, which design do you think
would be a better fit for our hotel?

133
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,110
A logo is a company's symbol.

134
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,180
It's a visual representation
of the hotel's identity.

135
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,390
I poured my heart and soul
into these designs.

136
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,530
So whichever you choose,
you'll be making the right decision.

137
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,130
Gosh, how boring.

138
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,930
A cliche question gets a generic answer.

139
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,770
- Director Ma.
- Right, Assistant Manager Jin?

140
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,540
Maybe you should try asking
a less cliche question.

141
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,940
What? Cliche?

142
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,880
What would a freeloader like you know?

143
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,790
Then why don't you enlighten us
with a clever question, Director Ma?

144
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,890
What is wrong with you two?
The professor is right here.

145
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Professor.

146
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,560
Which logo is...

147
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,270
going to make our Dream Hotel
a boatload of money?

148
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,070
- Pardon?
- Which logo will bring in more business?

149
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,470
That's what I'm asking.

150
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,010
My daughter lived abroad for a long time,
so her Korean isn't very polished.

151
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,680
She can be a little blunt.
I hope you'll understand.

152
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,850
It may be blunt,
but it's a valid question.

153
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,480
Option A...

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,650
was designed to convey
a sense of luxury and trust,

155
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,690
while Option B is designed based on
the hotel's warmth and comfort.

156
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,660
In that case, we should go with Option A.

157
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,300
The guests who come to Dream Hotel
want to escape their ordinary lives...

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,200
for a brief moment of luxury.

159
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
See?

160
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,610
You have to ask the right question
to get the right answer.

161
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,390
I wonder why that CEO
is so interested in our family.

162
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,330
I told her about our happy little family,
and she said she'd be in touch.

163
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,530
I thought she called you
so she'd invest in your album.

164
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,800
Yes, that's what she said.

165
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,770
But I guess since our family
isn't well-off,

166
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,010
it seemed like she was
just sounding me out...

167
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,110
to see if she could get anything from us.

168
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,910
No, I doubt that's it.

169
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,940
What do family finances
have to do with singing?

170
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,880
I wonder if there's another reason.

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
So,

172
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,290
what happened to that guitar
you promised me?

173
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,790
About that...

174
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,060
This awful woman just snatched my guitar
for no reason, and...

175
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,330
And?

176
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,070
- She totally smashed it.
- What? She smashed it?

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
Gosh, that's unbelievable!

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,040
I know, right? It's totally insane.

179
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,070
What kind of girl does that
and then just throws 100 dollars at me,

180
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,610
trying to wash her hands
of the whole thing?

181
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,240
I've never met anyone
so shameless in my life.

182
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,050
- Hey, that guitar was worth...
- Kang Baek Ho. Lawyer Kang.

183
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,820
Hey, are you making this story up?

184
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,390
You don't have to get me one.

185
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,860
It's the thought that counts.

186
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,860
What? But it's the truth!

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,830
Hey, you don't believe me?

188
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,580
Mom, does anything feel familiar?

189
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,390
That's right, Suk Hee.
Anything at all. It's okay, just tell us.

190
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,320
Let's go into the woods.

191
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,660
Why there?

192
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,130
I want some gimbap.

193
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,290
Suk Hee wants gimbap.

194
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,660
Let's go, Jang Mi.

195
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,830
Let's go there, Bok Gil.

196
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
All right, let's go.

197
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,840
Goodness.

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,510
But, Jang Mi.

199
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,840
Your exam is coming up soon.

200
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Should you be spending time like this?

201
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,150
It's okay, Dad.

202
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,350
I've been practicing
whenever I have a spare moment.

203
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,850
All right, let's go.

204
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,050
- Let's go!
- Come.

205
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,220
All right, a little picnic then.

206
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,030
You don't need to worry.

207
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,430
That was a full 30 years ago.

208
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,560
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,330
No one will see this and contact them.

210
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,370
And so?

211
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,870
They ate gimbap near the villa and left?
Is that what you're telling me?

212
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,910
- That's correct.
- Your complacency is the problem.

213
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,250
No one will contact them
because it was 30 years ago?

214
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,520
Jung Suk Hee's family is still trying
to dig up something that happened...

215
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,020
a full 30 years ago without giving up.

216
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,820
And you're telling me not to worry?

217
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,890
Those people haven't given up,
and you're telling me not to worry?

218
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,890
I apologize.

219
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,030
I won't make another mistake.

220
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,160
In your vocabulary,

221
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
the word "mistake" shouldn't even exist.

222
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,570
Got it?

00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,950
Numbers 16 through 30, please enter.

224
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,650
Yes.

(Artisan rice bread bakery,
made with our rice)

226
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
All right.

227
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,700
You have to pass this culinary exam,
Oh Jang Mi.

228
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,170
That's the only way I can become
Chef Kang Jun Ho's apprentice.

229
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,870
I can do this!

230
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,490
Italian meat sauce...

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,290
and a BLT sandwich.

232
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,710
Everyone, take one step back
and put your hands behind your back.

233
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,250
Begin.

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,230
(National Culinary Arts Certification,
Practical Exam)

235
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,330
It said, "All ingredients must be minced,"
right?

236
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,160
Submit at least 150ml of sauce,

237
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,530
and garnish with minced parsley.

238
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,150
Dad, I heard the pass rate
for Jang Mi's exam is only 30 percent.

239
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,250
Gosh, that's pretty strict.

240
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,660
Hey, if just anyone could pass,

241
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,090
it wouldn't be a national certificate.

242
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,160
That's true.

243
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,430
Dad, you think Jang Mi's doing okay?

244
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,160
Of course. She's my daughter, after all.

245
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,130
Since she takes after your mother,

246
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,600
she's good with her hands and very sharp,

247
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,270
so she's sure to pass.

248
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Yes.

249
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,240
If it weren't for the accident,

250
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,380
your mother would've been
a lawyer or a judge by now.

251
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,180
That old story about passing
the first part of the bar exam.

252
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,650
You've told me that a thousand times, Dad.
I'm sick of hearing it.

253
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
It's because it still makes my blood boil,
you punk!

254
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,160
Here, have some.

255
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,420
- These gummies are good.
- All right.

256
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,230
Look at my little bunny
sleeping so soundly.

257
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,760
My little bunny is so pretty.

258
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,600
The phone is turned off.

259
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,870
Please leave a message after the tone.

260
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,300
Charges will apply after the beep...

261
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Unbelievable.

262
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,580
You'll turn off your phone and ghost me?
Is that it?

263
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,280
And you dare to pocket the money
for the guitar?

264
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,220
Gosh, what am I supposed to do
with this woman?

265
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,090
I was going to cut her some slack,
but I can't let this slide.

266
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
What are you muttering about
all by yourself?

267
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,870
Here. You should put this on.

268
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,980
You can't get blood on the food.

269
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,510
- Thank you.
- Yes, hurry and put it on.

270
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,610
- Okay.
- All right.

271
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,520
Oh, no! What do I do? It's burnt.

272
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,890
What do I do?

273
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,460
Gosh, it's hot!

274
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,880
Pull yourself together, Oh Jang Mi!

275
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,450
I can't let it end like this.

276
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,510
Time's up.
Please step away from your stations.

277
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,720
It's okay, Oh Jang Mi.

278
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,230
Even if I get points taken off,
I didn't mess up anything else,

279
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,460
so maybe...

280
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,100
I can still pass.

281
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,500
Oh, please...

282
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,540
Please let me pass
so I can finally meet Chef Kang Jun Ho.

283
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,780
Sir, you look amazing.

284
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,150
This piece was practically made for you.

285
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,980
- I'll take it.
- Yes, I'll get that ready for you.

286
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,180
Ma'am.

287
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,680
- Me?
- You need to pay for that scarf.

288
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,150
You can't just leave with it.

289
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,920
What are you talking about? What scarf?

290
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- It looks like you're playing dumb.

291
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,590
I'm going to have to check your bag.

292
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,660
Are you out of your mind?

293
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,330
How dare you stop me?

294
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,800
I just need to check your bag.

295
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,530
Do you have any idea who I am?

296
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,840
It's me who keeps this store in business.

297
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,470
Your paycheck...

298
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,440
comes from my wallet.

299
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,910
You should know your place.

300
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,440
If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the police!

301
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
- What?
- Give it here.

302
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,980
- Let go!
- Just a second.

303
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,050
- Are you crazy?
- It'll just take a second.

304
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,180
Let go of this.

305
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,550
Seo Rin.

306
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,320
Did you pick out your gift?

307
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,930
So you chose this one and this one.

308
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,600
Not a bad choice.

309
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Could you ring these up, please?

310
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,970
But...

311
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,170
Is there a problem?

312
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,440
Understood.

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Thank you.

314
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,130
Impressive, Chef Kang.

315
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,500
You proved me right again, Chef Kang.
I knew I had a good eye.

316
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,540
Honestly, I was curious
to see how you'd react.

317
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,540
Are you telling me you were testing me?

318
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,010
Obviously.

319
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,010
You don't really think I'm stupid enough
to shoplift for no reason, do you?

320
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,820
- What?
- I was also bored.

321
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,090
Does being bored give you the right
to steal from people as a joke?

322
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,690
Don't look at me like that.
You're scaring me.

323
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,500
It's not like I meant to follow you here,
Chef Kang.

324
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,630
I was bored and came to the store
to kill some time,

325
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,270
and I just happened to see you
buying clothes.

326
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,710
So you stole something in front of me...

327
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,770
just to test my reaction?

328
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,710
What's so wrong with that?
If anything, you should be happy about it.

329
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,550
After all, you passed my test, Chef Kang.

330
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,520
You're an impressive man,
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

331
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,990
You're qualified to date me.

332
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,130
Listen up.

333
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,730
I have zero interest in dating you.

334
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,030
Don't ever pull a stunt like this
in front of me again.

335
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,240
Do it again,
and I'll turn you over to the police.

336
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,950
I can't stand entitled brats like you...

337
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,320
who hide behind their parents.

338
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,420
Darn it!

339
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,450
How dare he say he's not interested in me?

340
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,760
Kang Jun Ho...

341
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Just you wait.

342
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,030
I will make you mine.

343
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,570
What is it this time?

344
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,710
What do you think?

345
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,550
These are the outfits
for the hotel's grand reopening party.

346
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,050
After all, I was your personal stylist,
CEO Chae.

347
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,520
I was searching every single boutique
for this party,

348
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,650
and I found the perfect dress.

349
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,920
And the Chairman's tuxedo too.

350
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,360
I don't want them. Take them back.

351
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,990
This isn't just any reopening.

352
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,900
As if I'd wear something you picked out.

353
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,500
CEO Chae.

354
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,570
Hwa Young.

355
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,600
Come on, friend.

356
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,940
I went to so much trouble to find these.

357
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,310
I'm having Designer Wang
handle everything this time.

358
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,040
What's wrong, Mom?

359
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,050
Ms. Yeom went to every shop
to find these for you.

360
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,220
The least you could do
is pretend to wear it.

361
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,520
Ms. Yeom,
did you bring one for me as well?

362
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,990
Of course, Chairman.

363
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,660
Oh, my.

364
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,030
It suits you perfectly.

365
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,900
You look so dashing, Chairman.

366
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,580
Come and sit here for a moment.

367
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,150
Yes, Chairman.

368
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,190
You've been in and out of this house
as my daughter-in-law's stylist for years.

369
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,520
And having watched you all this time,

370
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,320
I think you're someone I can trust.

371
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,460
Absolutely, Chairman.

372
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,700
I would die for you, Chairman.

373
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,670
I know how much hardship you've endured
coming to this house all this time.

374
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,940
I've seen it all.

375
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Chairman...

376
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,270
Just knowing that you've noticed
is more than enough for me.

377
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,910
You've put up with all the humiliation
from my daughter-in-law.

378
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,610
And yet, you always smile, so carefree.
You never change.

379
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,880
You're like a streetlight,
always there in the same spot.

380
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,120
- Chairman.
- I am...

381
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,020
not one to trust people easily,

382
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,790
but you...

383
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,860
should stay by my side...

384
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,530
and be my shining light.

385
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,130
Chairman.

386
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,400
Thank you.

387
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,540
Thank you so much.

388
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,770
You know...

389
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,540
that I've always been in love
with you, don't you?

390
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,380
I'm so grateful that you...

391
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,110
finally acknowledged my feelings.

392
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,380
Chairman!

393
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,160
Of course.
How could I not know how you felt?

394
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,790
And from now on, no matter who it is,

395
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,990
do not say "I'm sorry" or "my apologies."

396
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,500
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

397
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,300
Chairman...

398
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,940
- Chairman...
- What does she think she's doing?

399
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,900
Yeom San Wol.

400
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,940
How dare you scheme to become
the matriarch of Dream Group?

401
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,520
So that was her ulterior motive
for coming to my house all this time?

402
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,290
Yeom San Wol.

403
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,590
You think you're going to become
my mother-in-law?

404
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,390
I'll never let that happen. Never!

405
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,860
Hey.

406
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,930
Have any part-time gigs opened up?

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,470
You must be a mind reader.

408
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,470
What is it? Is there really an opening?

409
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,600
It's for the grand reopening party
at Dream Hotel.

410
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,540
It's a private party,
invitation-only for VIPs.

411
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,440
So security will be super tight,
and it'll be a tough gig.

412
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,080
But the tougher the job,
the better the pay, right?

413
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,980
Thanks so much.

414
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,250
Okay!

415
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Jang Mi.

416
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,990
Someone called after seeing the banner.

417
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,490
They said they saw your mom.

418
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,460
Are you serious?

419
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,260
I'm telling you, it's true.

420
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,710
(The First Man)

421
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,710
You said you saw my wife, Suk Hee,
a long time ago?

422
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,350
I can soon find the person
who did this to you, Mom.

423
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,750
The actress, Chae Hwa Young,

424
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,860
was the pin-up star of my generation.

425
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,390
And now,

426
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,390
you're my idol, Professor.

427
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,290
You understood me when no one else did.

428
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,730
I'm about to do a really high-paying gig,
so I'll pay you back as soon as I'm paid.

429
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,770
She kind of looks like Director Ma.

430
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,040
