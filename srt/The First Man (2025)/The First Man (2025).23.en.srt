00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,640
Actually...

00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,110
(Episode 23)

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,780
I just learned a secret about my birth.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,880
A secret about your birth?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,480
I...

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,290
went my whole life without ever thinking
I wasn't my father's daughter.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,090
It turns out I'm not his real daughter.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,200
Still, my dad paid Mom's hospital bills
after her accident...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,600
and went through a lot to raise me.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,440
I can't go. It wouldn't be right.

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,540
You've seen my mom, ma'am, so you know.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,710
My mom used to be so brilliant,

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,150
but an accident left her like this.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,080
The person who did that to my mother.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,690
I'm going to catch them
with my own two hands.

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,260
Once I find them, I'll learn why and how
they did this to her.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,060
I'm going to uncover the whole truth.
And I'm going to make them pay for it.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,070
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,510
Jang Mi's gone. I don't see Jang Mi.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,180
Suk Hee, are you looking for Jang Mi?
She probably stepped out for a bit, okay?

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,120
- Don't worry, all right?
- Suk Hee wants to cry.

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,520
Jang Mi's gone.

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,690
She'll be back soon, okay?

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,220
Where did she go?

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,960
Of course. You have to.

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,670
But do you have any concrete evidence
to catch them?

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,470
I don't have evidence,

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,740
- but I do have a witness.
- A witness?

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,380
The one who gave the dashcam video?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,380
Yes. Now that we have a witness,
we should be able to catch them soon.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm going to prove that bad people
always get what's coming to them.

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,120
That's what makes the world a just place.

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,450
Absolutely. That's how it should be.

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,990
There are just too many bad people
in the world.

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,630
But that's a job for the police to handle.

36
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,430
Are you really giving up your chance
to study abroad...

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,470
just to catch those bad guys?

38
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,700
There is that,

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,370
but I have to take care of my mom.

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,640
After everything my dad has been through,

41
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,350
I can't just go off and do something
for myself.

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,780
What a shame.

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,190
Come on, you should reconsider.

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,030
Hey, watch your driving!

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,460
Are you trying to kill someone?

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,530
Hello, Detective. Any good news?

47
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,770
Really?

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,310
You found out who the guy with the scar
from the dashcam footage is?

49
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,180
If you're really thinking about
your father,

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
that's all the more reason
to study abroad.

51
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,180
Think about the long run.

52
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,180
Is helping at the side dish shop
right now...

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,250
really what's best for your dad?

54
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,920
If you go abroad,

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,260
and become a world-famous chef,
that's how you can truly repay him.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,160
Then you'll be able to give your dad
everything you couldn't before.

57
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,030
But still...

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,740
- Go on, take it.
- I'm sorry.

59
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,380
What is it?
Lawyer Kang, I'm busy right now.

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,750
Hey, wait a second, Jang Mi.

61
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,520
It's about that guy.

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,050
- We found out who he is.
- What guy?

63
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,460
You mean the guy with the scar
who tore down our banner?

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,590
You found out who he is? Who is he?

65
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,390
The detective identified him.

66
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,000
He has seven prior convictions.

67
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,530
Seven priors? So he's a total gangster.

68
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,870
Then if they know who he is,
they should get him soon, right?

69
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,610
- Probably.
- Okay. I'm heading to the station now.

70
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,140
- You're coming too, right? See you there.
- Hey, Jang Mi, wait!

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,820
Gosh, I could've given her a ride
and we could've gone together.

72
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,620
What's going on?

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,220
There's a gangster
who tore down our banner secretly.

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,690
The police found out who he is.

75
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,600
They did?

76
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,770
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
but I need to go to the police station.

77
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,200
You're leaving right now?

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,070
Yes, the detective just called,
so I'm heading over.

79
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,440
It's only a matter of time
before the bad people get caught.

80
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,280
When I get my hands on them, I'll rip
every single hair from their heads.

81
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,650
The jerks who did this to my mom
and made my dad suffer so much.

82
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,550
Once we catch them, we'll find out
why my mom had that accident,

83
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,550
and we'll finally be able
to solve this whole mystery.

84
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,990
When they're caught, I'll make sure
they pay for what they did.

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,460
And I'm so sorry.
You gave me such a great opportunity.

86
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,370
Stop by the shop later for side dishes.
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

87
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,800
Thanks for everything.

88
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,340
I'll be going.

89
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,420
You said it would be fine.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,120
- What?
- You said that there's no evidence...

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,390
and we'd be fine!

92
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,730
Tail Oh Jang Mi right now.

93
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,130
They've identified your goon, Ssangkal,
from the dashcam footage.

94
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,530
Oh Jang Mi is gleefully on her way
to the police station.

95
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,540
Take care of it.

96
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,640
- The police station?
- The police have identified Ssangkal.

97
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,680
Tell him to lay low.
If he gets caught, it's all over. Hurry!

98
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,120
Darn it, nothing is going my way! Nothing!

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Oh Jang Mi.

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,830
You must have a death wish.

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,760
If you'd just gone to study abroad,

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,030
I wouldn't have to
get any more blood on my hands.

103
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,840
Why won't you listen to me?

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,150
Hey, Jang Mi. I was actually
just about to call...

105
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,350
Lawyer Kang, a case just broke
and I'm heading out, so don't come over.

106
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,220
Okay, Detective. Understood.

107
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,360
In that case, I'll stop by tomorrow.

108
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,930
But Jang Mi must have already left.

(Ryu Hae Jun, CEO and doctor
at a digital healthcare firm)

111
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,000
Chairman. I've compiled a list
of potential suitors for Seo Rin.

112
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,970
What do you think?

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,580
They're from good families, have MBAs,
and are tall and handsome.

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,780
- They've got it all.
- Well, not bad.

115
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,320
If our Seo Rin marries a good man
and takes over the company,

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,420
you'll be able to breathe
a sigh of relief.

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,990
And then we could go on trips
and have some fun. Right?

118
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,800
If that were to happen,
I could finally relax.

119
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,500
It'd be a huge weight off my shoulders.

120
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,000
CEO Chae is so busy with her own work.

121
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,970
She can't even think
about finding a match for Seo Rin.

122
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,510
So I have no choice but to take matters
into my own hands.

123
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,750
But...

124
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,720
Seo Rin is completely smitten
with that chef.

125
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,850
Do you think she'll agree
to meet other men?

126
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,990
If the family forbids it,
she'll only want him more.

127
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,260
How about we invite Chef Kang over
and just treat him with formal courtesy?

128
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,660
Meanwhile, we have her meet these men
with impressive backgrounds,

130
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,070
- It's like playing both sides.
- Playing both sides?

131
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,010
- That's not a bad idea.
- Then I'll get right on it, Chairman.

132
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Oh my goodness.

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,590
Mom! I thought you said you'd set up

134

Then what were all those photos
of other guys for?

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,590
Their resumes looked incredible.

136

If you don't get it, just stay out of it.

137
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,190
Can't you see
this is all to lay the groundwork for you?

138
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,460
To lay the groundwork for me?

139
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,070
Seo Rin is crazy about Chef Kang,
so even if we throw other men at her,

140
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,170
- do you think she'd meet them?
- Of course not.

141
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,200
I wouldn't either.

142
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,040
Exactly. Which means the men
in these photos...

143
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,240
are for you to meet.

144
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,010
Oh my god!

145
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,210
I get to meet all of those men?

146
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,750
Of course, you silly girl.

147
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,220
You need to find a good match
and get married, too.

148
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,790
Why else do you think
I called it "playing both sides?"

149
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,230
Chef Kang and Seo Rin's relationship
hasn't even fully blossomed yet.

150
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,830
Imagine if the Chairman opposed it
right from the start.

151
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,370
Chef Kang would get scared
and run for the hills.

152
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,500
Then our grand ambition, Dream Group,

153
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,440
would slip right through our fingers,
wouldn't it?

154
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,070
Oh, you're right.

155
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,180
If Seo Rin marries Chef Kang Jun Ho,
who comes from a modest background,

156
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,480
and I marry that man
from the world of politics and finance,

157
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,310
then the Chairman will hand the company
over to me.

158
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,350
This is what they call
killing two birds with one stone.

159
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,820
Having our cake and eating it too.

Oh, my beautiful daughter,
my princess Hong Ju!

162
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,360
It's about that guy.

163
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,460
We found out who he is.

164
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,460
Okay. I'm heading to the station now.

165
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Oh Jang Mi,

166
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,320
you'll never uncover the truth.

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,520
I won't let you.

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,800
Hey, are you drunk driving?
Who races through an alley like that?

169
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,400
- Jang Mi, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

170
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,510
That really scared me.
A car just came out of nowhere...

171
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,680
I bet anything that was a drunk driver.
Why else would they flee a near miss?

172
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,420
If it weren't for you,
I would have been hit for sure.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,150
Thank you.

174
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,150
So, you're grateful?

175
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,220
You should be.

176
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,360
But you always try to get by
with just words.

177
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,030
I was grateful,
but then you had to go and run your mouth.

178
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,370
And just like that,
I don't feel so grateful anymore.

179
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,640
Come on, I'll walk you home.

180
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,770
Lawyer Kang.

181
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,140
You should just head home.

182
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,510
This is my family's problem.
I can handle the police station myself.

183
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,080
Right. I'm sure you've got it covered.

184
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,920
I appreciate you stepping in to help,

185
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,150
but I have to handle my own affairs.

186
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,760
You don't have to go to the station
today anyway.

187
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,060
- What?
- The detective called as I was leaving.

188
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,930
Everyone was called for backup for a case.
He said to come in tomorrow.

189
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,500
You'll just have to wait one more day.

190
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,470
It's late, so let's get you home.

191
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,110
Are you offering to take me home?

192
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,640
No, that's all right.

193
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,680
I can get home by myself.

194
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,250
Can we please just go?
You almost got killed just now.

195
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,620
Come on.

196
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,620
Quickly, come on.

197
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,890
Okay, just let go of me.

198
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,960
I really am grateful.

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,530
How grateful are you?

200
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,830
How am I supposed to put that into words?

201
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,370
- You have to tell me for me to know.
- I'm very grateful, okay?

202
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,570
Say "Thank you" three times.

203
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,880
You're unbelievable.

204
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,280
Thank you.

205
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,430
Wait, I thought you were coming from home.

206
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,600
Why were you coming from that direction
just now?

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,570
I met with CEO Chae.

208
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,370
What?

209
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,610
I've decided not to study abroad.
I went to tell her that.

210
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,310
You're not going to study abroad?

211
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,780
Why not?
It seems like such a good opportunity.

212
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
Just because.

213
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,990
My dad...

214
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,990
All this time,
he's been looking after me and my mom.

215
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,560
He's sacrificed so much.

216
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,970
How can I just...

217
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,440
leave everything to him
just to save myself?

218
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,210
A person has to have some decency.

219
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,140
Your father must be so disappointed.

220
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,510
I'm sure he just wants
what's best for you.

221
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Still, I'm kind of glad.

222
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,590
Now I can keep bickering with you
every day.

223
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,730
- What was that?
- I'm kidding.

224
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
I take it back.

225
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I'll get going.

226
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,600
About earlier...

227
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,070
Thanks for helping me out.

228
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,970
The lawyer helping Oh Jang Mi
is Kang Baek Ho.

229
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,970
He's Professor Kang's son.

230
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,570
She went home today
instead of the police station.

231
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,450
What am I going to do?

232
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,820
I can't just let Oh Jang Mi
run around freely.

233
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,720
What if Father or Hong Ju sees her?

234
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,490
No, what if Seo Rin...

235
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,190
The day Oh Jang Mi runs into Seo Rin,
it's all over.

236
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,730
I must convince Jang Mi to study abroad,
no matter what.

237
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,400
Or else,
I'll have no choice but to get rid of her.

238
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,900
Oh Jang Mi, it's all up to you in the end.

239
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Honey, it looks like you drank again.

240
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,330
Why are you drinking every single day?

241
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,860
I don't know. It just happened.

242
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,830
- Here, eat something sweet.
- What?

243
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,830
- Here.
- Okay.

244
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,840
You're ruining your health.

245
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,870
- Thanks.
- I'm home.

246
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,040
- Hey.
- Strawberries.

247
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,340
- I want some too.
- All right, for our baby boy, too.

248
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,210
Come on, really.

249
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,350
You seem to be in a good mood lately.

250
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,090
- Are you dating someone, son?
- No.

251
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,520
Then is there someone you like?

252
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,960
Maybe?

253
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,530
I'm not really sure myself.

254
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,670
Hey, have some more before you go.

255
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,240
I only picked men
with amazing credentials,

256
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,410
so you need to get ready
to go on blind dates.

257
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,410
Mom, aren't you jumping the gun?

258
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,080
It's my turn only
after Seo Rin turns them down.

259
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,550
How can I start going on dates right now?

260
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,220
Besides, Mom, what's the point?

261
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,950
Do you think guys with perfect resumes
would like me?

262
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,390
How would you even introduce me?

263
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,400
As the Chairman's future daughter?
Or as the freeloader in their house,

264
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,260
just walking on eggshells around CEO Chae?

265
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,670
You know, now that you mention it,
that is a problem.

266
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,470
That old man. I swear I ought to...

267
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,910
What? What are you going to do?

268
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,610
I'm going to finish this once and for all.
I can't take this anymore.

269
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,450
What is the meaning of this?

270
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,120
- Chairman.
- Let go! What's gotten into you?

271
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,890
Where are your manners?

272
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,860
I was going to handle it properly
when the time came,

273
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,260
and welcome you with respect.

274
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,070
Chairman...

275
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Oh my goodness.

276
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,620
You tramp!

277
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
Chae Hwa Young!

278
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,960
I took you in off the street,
and it turns out you have no shame.

279
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,700
What was that for?
What did I do to deserve you hitting me?

280
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,970
You've done nothing wrong?

281
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,440
Sneaking into Father's room as he slept
to make a move on him,

282
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,970
and you call that nothing?

283
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,610
Like it or not,
the Chairman and I are inseparable.

284
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,910
Do you think I'll forget this humiliation
once I marry him?

285
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,650
You should think about your own future.

286
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,120
Look at you,
still running that mouth of yours.

287
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,550
Let go of me!

288
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,290
- Oh, no...
- Over my dead body!

289
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,430
I’ll never accept you
as my mother-in-law. So get real.

290
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,430
And don't you dare use your daughter
to pull another stunt...

291
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,030
and have Kang Jun Ho over.

292
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,170
I won't let it slide next time.

293
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,570
This is your one and only warning.

294
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Understand?

295
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,440
Mark my words.

296
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,580
Inviting Kang Jun Ho was
all your daughter Ma Seo Rin's idea.

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,380
Get your facts straight
before you say another word.

298
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,150
Stop trying to pin the blame
on my daughter.

299
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,950
I bet you and Hong Ju...

300
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,920
are desperate for Seo Rin
to marry Kang Jun Ho.

301
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,520
But you can forget about that.
Even if Seo Rin were to get married,

302
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,290
do you really think
she'd leave this house?

303
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,730
Seo Rin is the Chairman's one
and only blood relative.

304
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
And you know what that means?
It means Dream Group...

305
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,740
will be inherited by Ma Seo Rin. Get it?

306
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,210
So don't even think about
getting your greedy hands on it.

307
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,390
Mom?

308
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,390
Who did this to you?

309
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,130
- Tell me. Is that CEO Chae?
- Hong Ju.

310
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,830
Listen, no matter what it takes,
you have to take over Dream Group.

311
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,400
It's my only wish.

312
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I will make her pay for this humiliation.

313
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Mom.

314
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,150
I feel terrible for Dad,

315
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,960
but who's my real father?

316
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
Tell me.

317
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,970
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

318
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,110
Jang Mi, come on. It's time to eat.

319
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,210
Okay.

320
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,650
All right.

321
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
I'm not going to the US.

322
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
What? Why not?

323
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,520
Of course, you shouldn't go.

324
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,750
You’d have to be crazy to go there
after hearing that.

325
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,620
- Stop it, Tae Sook.
- I knew you wouldn't go...

326
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,020
after I told you that.

327
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,130
- But don't you hold it against me.
- Tae Sook, that's enough.

328
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,930
Jang Mi's leaving.

329
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,230
If Jang Mi leaves, Suk Hee will be sad.

330
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,600
No, Mom. I'm not going.
I'm going to stay right here with you.

331
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:45,510
Jang Mi isn't leaving.
Jang Mi is staying with Suk Hee.

332
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,910
I love my Jang Mi.

333
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,780
Jang Mi. We need to talk.

334
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,430
It's over.

335
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,360
I already met with CEO Chae
and told her I'm not going.

336
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,870
- Jang Mi, are you serious?
- I told you already. I'm not going.

337
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,600
Why won't you go?
Why pass up such a great opportunity?

338
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,010
You know why, so why are you asking?

339
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,440
Is this because I'm not your real father?

340
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,580
Is it because you don't think
I can take care of your mom?

341
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,450
That's not it at all.

342
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,610
If I have any conscience at all,

343
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,450
how could I possibly leave Mom with you
and go?

344
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,090
It's not like you'd be leaving for good.

345
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,890
Are you never going to get married?

346
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,390
- Will you be tied to your mom forever?
- Stop it, Dad.

347
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,760
From now on, my goal is to find the people
who did this to my mom.

348
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,330
I'm heading out.

349
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,970
Jang Mi.

350
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,870
Get out of my head, Oh Jang Mi!

351
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,710
I just keep thinking about her.

352
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,140
Why am I thinking about
Oh Jang Mi all day?

353
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,520
But I wonder if Jang Mi
is really going to be okay.

354
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,320
She'd been dreaming of that cooking school
in the US for so long.

355
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,020
Do you know what my dream is?

356
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,660
To join Chang Restaurant,

357
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,530
learn as an apprentice
under Chef Kang Jun Ho,

358
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,560
and become a three-star Michelin chef.
That was my dream.

359
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,730
Should I talk to my brother about it?

360
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,200
If she could get a job
at Chang Restaurant,

361
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,870
she'd at least be able to
live out some of her dream.

362
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,370
Baek Ho, the meal is ready!

363
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
Here you go.

364
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,180
I know it might not be up
to our celebrity chef's standards,

365
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,250
but just eat up for your mom's sake, son.

366
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,420
Okay, Mom. That's enough.

367
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,920
And Mom, it suits my tastes just fine,
so don't worry.

368
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,660
You made this?
I thought the housekeeper made it.

369
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,060
Hey! Don't embarrass your mother.
Just drop it.

370
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,330
It's fine, honey.

371
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,500
As long as you're on my side, I'm happy.

372
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,970
Enjoy your meal, my king. Here you go.

373
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,840
Thank you, my queen. I will enjoy it.

374
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,340
Hey, Jun Ho...

375
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,910
What is it?

376
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,620
Never mind. Forget it.

377
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,820
What's with you, Baek Ho?

378
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,650
Don't start something and not finish.
What is it?

379
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,930
Jang Mi said you were her first love
and her idol.

380
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,170
But I really hate the thought
of her being with you.

381
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,930
That reminds me.

382
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,940
You said there was someone
who wanted a job at my restaurant?

383
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,010
Jang Mi? What about her?

384
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,710
Is that her name? Jang Mi?

385
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,580
Tell her to bring her resume
by the restaurant.

386
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,450
- What?
- Her injured hand is better now, right?

387
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,350
Well, I guess so, but...

388
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,790
Why? Did she find another job?

389
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,190
No, that's not it.

390
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,690
Okay, fine. I'll talk to her.

391
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,860
Why are you suddenly bringing this up now?

392
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,270
Hey, you're the one who injured her hand,
weren't you?

393
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,270
Yes, I was.

394
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,140
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

395
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,080
You're leaving right now?

396
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,080
Yes, the detective just called,
so I'm heading over.

397
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
It's only a matter of time
before the bad people get caught.

398
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,990
When I get my hands on them, I'll rip
every single hair from their heads.

399
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,260
The jerks who did this to my mom
and made my dad suffer so much.

400
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,060
Once we catch them, we'll find out
why my mom had that accident,

401
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,160
and we'll finally be able
to solve this whole mystery.

402
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,530
When they're caught, I'll make sure
they pay for what they did.

403
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,870
Go ahead. Try your best.

404
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,680
All bark and no bite.

405
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,350
Manager Lee, come in.

406
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,690
What's the deal with your lackey?

407
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,420
I heard the police identified him.
You need to put a stop to this.

408
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,160
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

409
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,370
What should I do?

410
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,240
For Jang Mi's dream,

411
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,270
introducing her to my brother
is the right thing to do.

412
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,740
But my heart...

413
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,910
is screaming at me not to let her go.

414
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,550
Come on, what am I going to do?

415
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,690
Yes, Detective.

416
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,120
I'm back.

417
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
What?

418
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,400
Jang Mi, where are you?
Get over to the police station now.

419
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,400
The police can't do anything
with just that video.

420
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
But your lackey has been identified.

421
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,640
It's bound to be traced back to you,
isn't it?

422
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,780
He's tight-lipped.
You don't need to worry.

423
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,880
No matter what,
this won't blow back on you, ma'am.

424
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,020
And what about the witness
who has the dashcam footage?

425
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,950
Don't you worry. It's been handled.

426
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,720
This is such a headache.

427
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,220
Why is everything blowing up at once?

428
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,060
Don't let your lackey get caught.
Understood?

429
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,130
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,600
As soon as this whole thing dies down,

431
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,870
I'll take care of Oh Jang Mi myself.

432

(The First Man)

436
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,070
If we catch this man, we'll finally solve
the mystery of what happened to my mom.

437
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,240
Which means there's someone
powerful backing him up.

438
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,710
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview you.

439
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,780
So you're saying Chef Kang Jun Ho
wants to meet me, is that it?

440
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,320
- Her name is Jang Mi?
- It's a pretty name, right?

441
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,750
Do you like her?

442
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,890
Just imagine Chef Kang Jun Ho
meeting Oh Jang Mi.

443
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,060
She's a dead ringer for Seo Rin!

444
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
We have to do something to stop this.
