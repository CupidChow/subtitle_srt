1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,440
This is a video the witness sent us.
I sent it to you. Check it out.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,080
I think the guy with the scar
on his face is the culprit.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,560
Hey, watch your driving!

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,330
- Are you trying to kill someone?
- I'm sorry.

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,930
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,200
Boss, I took the banner down properly.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,100
Right. I'll make sure
I don't leave any traces.

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,170
Unfortunately,

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,580
the dashcam didn't capture him
taking down the banner.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,180
But according to the witness
who sent the video,

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,150
the witness definitely saw the man
with the scar taking down the banner.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,550
Really?

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,690
Then it really does sound
like he's our guy.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,320
And what a scar on his face...

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,670
When did you get here?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,410
Just now.

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,610
You're with CEO Chae
from the Dream Hotel...

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Yes.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,250
I'm Director Lee Kang Hyuk.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,580
Right. Hello.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,880
It seems...

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,020
I've interrupted something.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,160
Well, we're looking for a suspect.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,330
A suspect?

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
Yes, it's just something we're working on.

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,500
So, what brings you here?

27
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,840
Oh, yes.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,140
CEO Chae would like to speak
with you, Ms. Oh.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,740
She wants to see me?

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,520
What? What do you mean, there's a video
of the banner being taken down?

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
I don't know
how Oh Jang Mi got that video.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,090
What do you mean you don't know?
How could you be so careless?

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,430
And to make matters worse,
your man, Ssangkal or whatever,

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,830
had his face caught on the dashcam?

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,640
How can these cockroaches
be so relentless?

37
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,970
They just won't quit.

38
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,510
We have to stop them. Whatever it takes.

39
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,310
If that video contains definitive proof,

40
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,120
it's only a matter of time
before they find out what we did.

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm sorry. I will put a stop to it myself.

42
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,420
I will ensure this doesn't affect you.
Please do not worry.

43
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,060
How can I not worry? How?

44
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,660
Not when they could be coming
for my throat at any moment.

45
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,830
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,630
Who's coming for your throat, Mom?

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,970
Who do you think?
Yeom San Wol and Jin Hong Ju.

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,170
This is no time for you
to be casually dropping by my office.

49
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,110
That shameless mother-daughter duo
is cozying up to the Chairman,

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,010
and they're hell-bent
on stealing your position.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,180
Enough with the nagging.

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,790
- That feels great.
- Does that feel good?

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,430
- Yes. And right here.
- Right here.

54
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,760
That feels great.

55
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,500
I have magic hands, don't I, Chairman?

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,700
For all those years, I was always the one
who massaged CEO Chae's shoulders.

57
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,640
Really?

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,380
That really hits the spot.

59
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Look at that vixen,
putting on a show again.

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,920
She's no different from me,
just another servant.

61
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,590
But she's desperately trying
to claw her way to the top.

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,790
You startled me!

63
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,430
What are you doing skulking around
and eavesdropping?

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,300
Eavesdropping? Who's eavesdropping?

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,930
I brought some pumpkin porridge
for the Chairman.

66
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,910
Good. Bring it here.

67
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,680
Pumpkin porridge.

68
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Chairman.

69
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,930
- I'm so humiliated I could just die.
- Why's that?

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,130
Now that I'm living here under your roof,

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,430
even the staff here treats me like dirt.

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,040
Just look. She only brought porridge
for you.

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,880
Even though she knew I was here,
she left me out completely.

74
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,280
I get hungry too, you know.

75
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,110
For goodness' sake.

76
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,850
Come on, don't get upset
over something like that.

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,390
There, there. All right.

78
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,790
Here. Try this.

79
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
Oh my.

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,090
- Come on, eat up.
- Okay.

81
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,030
There. Isn't that better?

82
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,300
I think Mrs. Yang brought
only one spoon on purpose...

83
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
so we'd share the pumpkin porridge.

84
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,830
There's nothing
to get so worked up about, right?

85
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,340
You think so?

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,410
Then you should have some too, Chairman.

87
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,110
Me?

88
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,510
There you go.

89
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,740
Somehow, this tastes even better.

90
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,420
He looks so disgusting.

91
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,420
Come on, I said I'll take you.

92
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,490
No, it's okay. I'm meeting CEO Chae.
Why would you come? I can go by myself.

93
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,400
But the thing is, the dashcam footage
doesn't show the guy removing the banner.

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,800
Tell me about it.

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,230
It's too bad that without that footage,
it isn't the smoking gun we need.

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,500
Our top priority is finding the man
with the scar on his face.

97
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm heading out.

98
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,880
- All right, be safe.
- Okay.

99
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,710
Let me know why
CEO Chae wanted to see you.

100
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,690
First, I have to see
if there's any concrete evidence...

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,430
in the video.

102
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,630
I was wondering why you wanted to see me.

103
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,500
Did I do something wrong, ma'am?

104
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
A mistake? No, of course not.

105
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,910
The reason I asked to see you is...

106
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,080
I just have to take this call.
I'll be right back.

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,070
That's right.
You'd better do that, Oh Jang Mi.

108
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,600
Have you met with our CEO?

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,600
Just texting to confirm.

110
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,070
Yes, I'm with her now.

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm so sorry. I call you in
and then act all busy...

112
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,720
Oh my gosh, what do I do? Oh no!

113
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,290
I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,550
It's all right.

115
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,160
It's not all right.
You must clean it up now,

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,290
or it will set
and you'll never get the stain out.

117
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,130
Quick, go clean it up in the restroom.
I feel just terrible about this.

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,370
It's okay. I'll just be a minute.

119
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes, go quickly. I'm sorry!

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,240
It's nothing.

121
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,110
(Draw pattern to unlock)

122
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,210
(Incorrect pattern)

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,250
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.
Why won't it unlock?

124
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,520
Come on, before she gets back...

125
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,490
I have to hurry before she gets back...

126
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm sure this was the pattern.

127
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,590
(Hint)

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,570
So simple-minded.

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,620
Oh my...

130
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,050
It's fine.

131
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,840
Fortunately, there's no smoking gun.

132
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,110
It's a huge relief it didn't capture him
taking down the banner.

133
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,780
Again, I'm so sorry about that.

134
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,850
Don't worry about it.

135
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,820
As I was saying, I asked to see you...

136
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,390
because you said your dream
was to be a chef, right?

137
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,790
Your lunch box was so good.

138
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,230
It's a shame to waste such talent.

139
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,930
You enjoyed it?

140
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,830
Thank you.

141
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,940
There's no need to thank me
for enjoying your food.

142
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,440
You seem like a very kind person, Jang Mi.

143
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,870
I saw how good you were
to your mother the other day.

144
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,610
Not at all.

145
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,080
I could...

146
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,680
never love my mom
half as much as she loves me.

147
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,180
By the way,

148
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,120
how did your mother have her accident?

149
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,760
Was it a car accident?

150
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
No.

151
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,560
She fell into a river
and went into a coma.

152
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,970
My dad says...

153
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,970
he's sure it happened while she was
being chased by some bad guys.

154
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,970
He said he'll make the culprit pay
if he ever catches them.

155
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,740
- "The culprit?"
- Yes.

156
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,750
When my dad saw my mom in the hospital,

157
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,480
her face and hands...

158
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,790
were all scratched and scraped up
from tree branches.

159
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,720
So based on that, he's convinced...

160
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,820
she must have been running
from some bad guys...

161
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,160
when the accident happened.

162
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,060
Wait, something doesn't add up.

163
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,130
Pardon?

164
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,930
First you mentioned a culprit,
then you said she ran from some bad guys.

165
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,140
So does that mean your father
actually saw something?

166
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,870
I'm not exactly sure,

167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,350
but my dad swore he wouldn't rest until
he found the person who did this to her,

168
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,510
so he's been relentlessly searching
for the culprit.

169
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,090
He insists there has to be a culprit
who's responsible.

170
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,560
He must have some proof, then?

171
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,490
He doesn't have any proof,

172
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,830
but we recently put up a banner about it,

173
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,730
and some guy secretly took it down.

174
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,770
What else could that mean?

175
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,440
It means he's the culprit.

176
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,510
Oh, is that so?

177
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,040
I really hope you catch him.
I'll be rooting for you.

178
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,550
Thank you.

179
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,320
We'll definitely catch him
and make him pay.

180
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,150
Where are my manners?

181
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,090
I brought you here
and all I've done is go off on a tangent.

182
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,630
The thing is, our company...

183
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,960
has a program sponsored
by the Dream Scholarship Foundation.

184
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,030
Our company's motto is,

185
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,570
We want to be the Dream
for young people with dreams.

186
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,280
And seeing you work hard while taking care
of your sick mother is so admirable.

187
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,610
I'd like to send you abroad to study.

188
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,320
What?

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,350
Study abroad?

190
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,990
Study abroad?

191
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,890
CEO Chae is sending you to study abroad?

192
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,360
- Yes, I'm serious!
- That's amazing!

193
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,430
Are you serious?

194
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,530
Where did this suddenly come from?

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,340
I'm still in shock myself.
It feels like I won the lottery.

196
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,040
I can't believe
such a wonderful person exists.

197
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,110
She gave you your chance to sing,
Tae Pyung,

198
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,580
and now she's sending you abroad to study?

199
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,250
I don't know how we can ever thank her.

200
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,490
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

201
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,760
Gosh, I'm dying to know
what CEO Chae said to her.

202
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,930
Look at her, not even calling.

203
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,960
I asked her to call me.

204
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,960
It goes in one ear and out the other.

205
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,600
Is she still with her?

206
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,410
No.

207
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,610
If I call Jang Mi,
she'll think I'm interested in her...

208
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,110
and get the completely wrong idea.

209
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,490
Hey, Tae Pyung.

210
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,090
Is Jang Mi back from her meeting
with CEO Chae?

211
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,960
What? Study abroad?

212
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Hi.

213
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,600
Hwa Young, what's the occasion?
You actually called me first.

214
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,770
I called because I missed you,
Professor Kang.

215
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,110
Let's get something delicious.

216
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,780
You seem happy.

217
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,150
I am. It feels like a huge weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

218
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,620
Everything just fell into place
all at once.

219
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,160
It's been a while since I've heard you
this happy, Hwa Young,

220
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,460
and it makes me happy too.

221
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,490
Here.

222
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,260
I'm home.

223
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,870
What's this?

224
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
What?

225
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,910
Wait a minute.

226
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,480
- Kang Baek Ho!
- Gosh, you scared me!

227
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,950
Hey...

228
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,790
- This is for Jun Ho and your dad.
- That's not fair.

229
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
- So I'm not your son, is that it?
- Oh, please. Don't be so dramatic.

230
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,690
You know Jun Ho
has his sales review tomorrow.

231
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,960
That CEO, or whatever she is,
is trying to kick him out.

232
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,830
She told him to double the sales
or get out.

233
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,870
That CEO is always the problem.

234
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,870
I need to make sure Jun Ho eats this
to keep his strength up.

235
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,740
Fine. It's so unfair,
I wouldn't eat it now if you paid me.

236
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,380
- I must be adopted, right?
- Come on, the things you say.

237
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,250
But you seem to have your head
in the clouds lately.

238
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,990
You should pay more attention to your dad.

239
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,990
Dad? Why?

240
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,420
He's going through menopause.

241
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,030
When you're going through that,
a butterfly can make your heart flutter,

242
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,230
and a single falling leaf
can make you feel sentimental.

243
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,200
That's ridiculous.
Dad is going through menopause?

244
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,570
He's as spry as ever.

245
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,470
- Are you sure it's not you?
- Good grief, kid.

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm well past menopause
and into my golden years.

247
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,010
But I'm too busy to have time
for any of that nonsense.

248
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,280
- Why?
- You should have some too, Mom.

249
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,920
- Hey, stop! Seriously, stop!
- Here, have some too Mom.

250
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,020
I'll approve it at the office tomorrow,
just so you know.

251
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,160
I thought I made myself clear
about cutting ingredient costs.

252
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,060
Tell Chef Kang Jun Ho...

253
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,600
to get his numbers right
for tomorrow's sales review.

254
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,310
Are your employees giving you a hard time?

255
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,110
I hear Chang Restaurant at the hotel
is quite delicious.

256
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,050
The food itself is delicious.
It's the head chef I can't stand.

257
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,720
Really? Why is that?

258
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,960
I would think
that's all that matters for a chef.

259
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,560
I see. He must have really gotten
on your bad side.

260
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,600
You know...

261
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,700
how some employees
just rub you the wrong way?

262
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,170
When I really think about it,

263
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,070
maybe I dislike him because he's prickly,
just like me.

264
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,240
Or because his blunt honesty
gets on my nerves.

265
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,670
That might be why he bugs me.

266
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,080
Anyway, he's arrogant,

267
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
and a bit of a jerk.

268
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,210
I see.

269
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,450
I can't believe I'm telling you all this.

270
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,090
I'm actually happy you told me that.

271
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,220
It feels like you're opening up to me.

272
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,030
It means you trust me.

273
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,240
I shouldn't be growing this fond of you.

274
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,810
And why not?

275
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,010
You should just follow your heart.

276
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,480
Your son is Kang Baek Ho,
the lawyer, right?

277
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,320
Is he your only son?

278
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,960
No, I have two.

279
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,060
I can't bring myself to tell her
Kang Jun Ho is my son.

280
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,300
I thought you only had one.

281
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,400
Anyway, you're a family man.

282
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,770
If we follow our hearts,
how far can we really go?

283
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,980
As far as we can.

284
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,580
All the way.

285
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,610
Manager Lee will bring you the paperwork
you need for studying abroad.

286
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,690
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

287
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,030
I'm home.

288
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,730
Jang Mi, you're home.

289
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,940
Good work, Jang Mi.

290
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Mom.

291
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,140
Is it really okay for me
to go study abroad?

292
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,110
I won't be here by your side.

293
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,350
Is it selfish of me to go for my own sake?

294
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm so sorry.

295
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,450
Mom.

296
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,060
But I really want to go.

297
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,290
Jang Mi, you're so beautiful.

298
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,760
You're such a good daughter.

299
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,500
I love you so much, Jang Mi.

300
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Mom.

301
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,540
Me too.

302
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,140
I love you too, Mom.

303
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,940
I love you, Mom,

304
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,810
so much.

305
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,170
Unfortunately, you didn't manage
to double the sales.

306
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,510
Was I asking for too much?

307
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,710
A deal's a deal,

308
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,750
so please leave Chang Restaurant.
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

309
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,480
That's not going to happen.

310
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,250
I haven't broken our promise.

311
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,490
Which is why I'm not leaving.

312
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
What?

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,260
You won't leave
because you didn't break our promise?

314
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,590
That's right.

315
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Because I achieved more than
double the sales we promised.

316
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,100
How is this more than double the sales?

317
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,570
It is if you include the reservations
in the final tally.

318
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,200
A fine-dining restaurant can only handle
so many customers a day,

319
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,810
as I'm sure you're well aware, ma'am.

320
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,740
Including reservations?

321
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,980
Where did you learn to do math?

322
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,580
Sales is based on what's been paid.
Get that straight.

323
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,090
Reservations can be canceled.
There are too many variables.

324
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,050
Is it sensible to count them as sales?

325
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,860
These are non-cancelable
confirmed reservations.

326
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,490
That brings the total to about 2.15 times.

327
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,230
These reservations
include prepaid deposits.

328
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,970
And our special reservations
are fully booked through next year.

329
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,670
I asked for double the sales,
not the promise of future earnings.

330
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,380
The numbers need to be backed up by data.

331
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,880
You've worked hard,
but it's a shame it's come to this.

332
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,350
Goodbye, Chef Kang Jun Ho.

333
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,070
Why don't you take a look at this
before you say another word,

334
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,540
instead of just trying to find
a way to fire me?

335
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
What's this?

336
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,440
It's the Dream Hotel sales report
for this quarter.

337
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,610
In your own report on Dream Hotel's
overall performance,

338
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,210
you included the sales
from room reservations.

339
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,490
- How did you...
- You said numbers are all about data.

340
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,590
You're allowed to include reservations,

341
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,390
so why can't I?

342
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,330
What kind of logic is that?
It's a double standard.

343
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,660
Don't ever make
such an unreasonable demand...

344
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,400
of an employee again.

345
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,240
And stop looking for excuses to fire them.

346
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,010
This isn't how you boost employee morale.

347
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
- It just makes them lose trust in you.
- Excuse me?

348
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,010
And ultimately,
that's bad for Dream Hotel, isn't it?

349
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,380
But I'm sure you already know that.

350
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,180
Now, if you'll excuse me.

351
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,490
That arrogant brat.

352
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,030
Ma'am.

353
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,370
The first thing I'll do
is get Kang Jun Ho out of this hotel.

354
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,510
That arrogant jerk.
I swear, I will fire him.

355
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,880
Who does he think he is, lecturing me?

356
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,940
I'll keep a close eye on him.

357
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,310
And Oh Jang Mi is being ridiculous
about catching the culprit.

358
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,120
Just take her the study abroad documents
and get it over with.

359
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,850
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,660
Don't give it a second thought.
Go study in the US. It's been your dream.

361
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,930
I just don't know if I should go.

362
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,130
You'll have such a hard time
on your own, Dad.

363
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,730
And it'll be tough
taking care of Mom without me.

364
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,640
- I told you not to worry about us.
- Dad.

365
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,670
You'll regret it for the rest of your life
if you pass up an opportunity like this.

366
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,410
- Welcome.
- Manager Lee?

367
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,080
Welcome.

368
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,020
You must be from CEO Chae's hotel.
It's nice to meet you.

369
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,250
We're so grateful for everything
you've done for Jang Mi and Tae Pyung.

370
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,590
And please give my thanks
to CEO Chae as well.

371
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,160
I will.

372
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,830
Here are the necessary documents
for your studies abroad.

373
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,600
Thank you.

374
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Suk Hee.

375
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,010
Wait.

376
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,240
Mom, what's wrong?

377
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,610
- Suk Hee?
- Mom.

378
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,250
- Mom, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

379
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,210
Suk Hee?

380
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,990
Mom.

381
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,360
Mom, can you hear me?

382
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,890
- Dad.
- Suk Hee!

383
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,090
Mom, please, wake up.

384
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,960
What do I do? Mom...

385
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,430
What? You're saying
Jung Suk Hee recognized you?

386
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,540
She was pointing at me
and shaking uncontrollably,

387
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,070
and she wouldn't stop screaming.

388
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,640
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

389
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,940
Darn it.

390
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,580
So it's true. The emotions remain
even when the memory is gone.

391
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,910
What are we going to do about this?

392
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,280
There's a chance Oh Jang Mi and her family
might start to suspect me.

393
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
For the time being,

394
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,420
you had better stay far away
from Jung Suk Hee.

395
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,060
I can't let my guard down
for one second with those lowlives.

396
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,200
I should just make both Jung Suk Hee
and Oh Jang Mi disappear.

397
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,570
Still, if Oh Jang Mi goes to the US,
we'll be able to breathe a little easier.

398
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,340
We need to get her out of here, fast.

399
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,650
I'm just glad it wasn't any worse.

400
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,480
She's finally calmed down
and fallen asleep.

401
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,950
Yes.

402
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,350
But, Dad...

403
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,990
That episode Mom had,

404
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,920
it seemed different than usual.

405
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,960
It did, didn't it?

406
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,700
Why would she get so agitated
and point at that man?

407
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,800
I know, right?

408
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,270
She was trembling
just looking at Manager Lee.

409
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,730
I wonder why.

410
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
I don't know.

411
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
What is this?

412
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,810
Tae Sook.

413
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,440
The Dream Scholarship Foundation?

414
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,480
What? LA?

415
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,520
- You're studying abroad?
- I'm sorry, Tae Sook.

416
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,790
It just kind of happened.

417
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,890
- Don't go. No, you can't go.
- Tae Sook.

418
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,890
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

419
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,460
You know how much I've always wanted
to study abroad.

420
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,930
The company is paying for everything.

421
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,240
You think it's about money? Are you mad?

422
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,300
What about Mom?
How can you even think of leaving her?

423
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
The thing is...

424
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm worried about Mom too,

425
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,650
but I really want to go.

426
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,980
This is the last chance I'll ever get.

427
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,120
Think about Mom.

428
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,120
Don't you know she starts looking for you
the second you're out of her sight?

429
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,890
I'm against it.

430
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,490
I am against you studying abroad.

431
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Let me be clear. I am against it.

432
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,740
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

433
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,250
Yes, Detective.

434
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,310
I'm counting on you.

435
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,920
Right.

436
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,250
I think the culprit from that banner video
will get caught soon.

437
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
By the way, Jang Mi,

439
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,030
have you decided to study abroad?

440
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,600
You're asking why I'm against it?

441
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,940
Seriously. It's because
I hate seeing you struggle!

442
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,170
After everything you've been through
paying for Mom's medical bills...

443
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,380
That's enough.

444
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,910
Do you know why Jang Mi keeps going on
about wanting to study abroad?

445
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,250
It's too much for her
to take care of Mother who isn't well.

446
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,980
She just wants to abandon her
and run away.

447
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:57,590
Oh Tae Sook, stop it.
How can you say that about your sister?

448
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,360
Sister? Please.

449
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,130
It's time you told Jang Mi the truth, Dad.

450
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,530
Tell her that her mom is Suk Hee,
but Dad isn't her biological father.

451
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,270
Tell her that she's not blood-related
to us at all!

452
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,870
I said stop.
If you say that one more time,

453
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm done with you.

454
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,510
I don't care if you're done with me.
Just please, tell Jang Mi.

455
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,080
- You need to stop this too, Dad!
- Just stop it, Oh Tae Sook.

456
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,180
Let's talk about this later.

457
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,590
Jang Mi...

458
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,210
(The First Man)

459
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,920
I didn't know anything.

460
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,650
- Jang Mi.
- This isn't the world I thought I knew.

461
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,420
It feels like I'm living
in a completely different world.

462
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,830
Chairman, what if we invited
Chef Kang Jun Ho over?

463
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,590
Ma Seo Rin.
This was your doing, wasn't it?

464
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,800
Do you think Kang Jun Ho would come here
just because you invited him?

465
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,670
This is the last letter Suk Hee sent me.

466
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,170
I hear you're not studying abroad.

467
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,570
Was there a sudden change of heart?

468
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,210
Because I found out the truth
about my birth.

469
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,610
