00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,380
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,410
Hong Ju, don't worry.
I've got it all figured out.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm here to see the Chairman right now,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,650
so I want you to come a little later.
Got it?

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,700
Please accept my formal bow, Chairman.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,440
A formal bow?

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,240
I've come to bid you a final farewell.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,510
What's all this? "Final" farewell?
Goodness!

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,350
Mrs. Yeom, are you leaving?

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,380
Oh my, are you sick? You don't look well.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,720
Are you in a lot of pain?

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,620
Here, have a seat. Go on, sit down.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,730
What's the point of living
in this cruel world?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,870
I was nearly 40 when I first met you,

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,810
but before that,
because of my husband's gambling habit,

16
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,240
I had to run away with Hong Ju
and barely managed to get a divorce.

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,680
Then I met CEO Chae
and started working as her coordinator...

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,020
I already know all of that.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,790
And I had to put up with
all of CEO Chae's abuse.

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,420
There were times I felt so hopeless
that I would swallow my pride...

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,930
and just wanted to die.

22
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,530
But the only reason I could grit my teeth
and keep going was...

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,870
for my one and only daughter, Hong Ju.

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,200
I've lived to see her succeed.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,340
I know that.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,040
And being by your side like this,

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,580
serving you, has been an honor.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,180
I gave CEO Chae a piece of my mind.
Is she still keeping you away from here?

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
- Is that what this is about?
- Now I'll never be...

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,380
able to see you again.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,960
Now I'm being sent far away to India
to waste away from sickness.

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,220
What are you talking about? India?

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,160
CEO Chae...

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,600
has transferred my Hong Ju to India.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,670
I have no idea what she's supposed to do
in that faraway land.

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,110
My daughter and I will go to India
and just die, Chairman.

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,440
She transferred Hong Ju to India?

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,980
And she did it without even consulting me?

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,590
I'm sure CEO Chae thought
long and hard about it.

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,990
But at the end of the day,

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,390
this is about her determination
to tear you and me apart.

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,860
What else could this be...

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,430
but the result of her ambitious
and "thoughtful" scheming?

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,110
I wonder what Lawyer Kang looks like.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,890
He's here.

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,850
- Come on in.
- Oh my gosh, what do I do?

47
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,260
Make yourself at home.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,930
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you all.
My name is Kang Baek Ho...

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,230
Welcome.

50
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,870
What?

51
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,330
You!

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,100
- It can't be.
- Rude Pervert?

53
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,070
- The Rude Guitar?
- What's going on?

54
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,540
Do you two know each other?

55
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,240
Jang Mi, what's going on?

56
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,350
Hey, why did you call him a jerk?

57
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,950
What is all this?

58
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
It's nothing.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,730
- It's nothing?
- It's just we have a history.

60
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,600
We just know each other from around,

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,330
but I didn't expect to see you here.

62
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,440
Tell me about it.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,370
What's going on?

64
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,340
You've run into Lawyer Kang before?

65
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,740
What a small world.
Come on, have a seat. Please, sit down.

66
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,080
Yes, Mr. Oh.
Ms. Jung, you said you like roses, right?

67
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,750
I hate flowers.

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,020
The thorns will prick you.
I prefer cookies.

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,400
- Let's all sit down. Yes.
- Yes.

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,700
(Seeking witnesses)

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
My apologies.

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,510
I will make sure it's taken down
by the end of the day.

73
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,980
Make sure there are no slip-ups this time.

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,550
And check for any security cameras
in the area.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,150
- Yes, don't worry.
- They just won't quit.

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,350
That was so long ago.

77
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,890
All this time has passed,
and they're still at it, causing a scene?

78
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,690
They're like weeds.

79
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,530
You pull them out, you stomp on them,
but they stubbornly pop right back up.

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,530
Weeds,
determined to ruin my flower garden.

81
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,570
That's why we have to rip them out
by the roots...

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,010
before they can even sprout.

83
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,930
Why aren't you eating?

84
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,230
I was just enjoying watching you eat.

85
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,700
Kang Baek Ho,
have you been starving or something?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,170
We've eaten together a million times,
but I've never seen you eat like this.

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,380
You're not putting on a show
for Jang Mi, are you?

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,680
Tae Pyung,
why are you dragging me into this?

89
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,320
No, it's just that it's all so delicious,
I can't help but inhale it.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,720
- Seriously, it's all so good! All of it!
- I know, right?

91
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,960
Jang Mi and Suk Hee are fantastic cooks.

92
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,360
Here, have some more.

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,930
- Go on, eat up. All of it.
- I think I'm going to explode.

94
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,830
But I just can't stop.

95
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,170
Would you like me to get you some more?

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,210
No, I'm good, thank you.

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,210
But I have to say, Jang Mi,
your cooking is the best.

98
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,410
My mom made the japchae.

99
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,480
Japchae is my specialty.
Jung Suk Hee makes a mean japchae.

100
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,690
Oh, really?

101
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,060
But it seems like such a waste for me
to have all this to myself.

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,420
Don't lay it on too thick.

103
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,730
No, I'm serious.
I'd love to eat like this every day.

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,700
Come eat with us often.

105
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,500
You're helping Tae Pyung with his work,

106
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,500
and you gave him that expensive guitar.
We already owe you so much.

107
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,400
Then, I'll come by often
and buy some side dishes.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,510
Okay.

109
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,540
Jang Mi, that's okay with you, right?

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,450
Of course.
My brother already owes you so much.

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,450
But I hurt my hand,
so it might be difficult for a while.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Oh, right.

113
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,320
I swear, if I find the guy who did this
to Jang Mi's hand, he'll pay.

114
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,300
You're right.

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,370
Who was it that hurt your hand?

116
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,100
It happened while you were working
part-time at the hotel,

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,700
so was it someone who works there?

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,210
I already consulted Lawyer Kang about
beating the guy who hurt you to a pulp.

119
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,180
Quickly talk it over with Lawyer Kang
and file a complaint.

120
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,710
Oh, you think I should?

121
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,220
Lawyer Kang, if you're finished eating,
let's have that consultation.

122
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,990
Hey...

123
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
What are you doing?

124
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,330
- You okay?
- Yes.

125
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,930
I said you didn't have to do it.

126
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,030
Not at all.
You treated me to such a wonderful meal.

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,330
The least I can do is wash the dishes.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370
I do a great job with the dishes
at home, too.

129
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,670
Then, I'll let you
take care of it, Mr. Lawyer.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,340
As you can see, I've hurt my hand.

131
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,480
Say no more.

132
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,350
- Please, go have a seat.
- What?

133
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,480
Dad, come on.

134
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,920
I feel so bad making our guest do this.

135
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,060
- Hey.
- What?

136
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,020
- Hey, let's go.
- What?

137
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,290
- Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

138
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,130
- Get out here. Let's go.
- Hold on.

139
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,530
Come on.

140
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,630
Hey, just let them be alone.
We should just pretend we don't notice.

141
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,000
What do you mean, Dad?

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,140
He's our guest. It's his first time over.

143
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,210
Who makes their guest do the dishes?

144
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,310
You have to give a young man and woman
some time alone together.

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,210
Didn't you see the look
Jang Mi gave us earlier?

146
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,080
- What?
- I think Jang Mi...

147
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,890
has a thing for the lawyer.

148
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,260
That's why she was practically
pushing us out of there.

149
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,720
No way.

150
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,560
Lawyer Kang would be perfect for her.
I'm all for it.

151
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,100
I'm for it, too.

152
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,770
I only kept quiet
to save you the embarrassment.

153
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,110
So you'd better appreciate it.

154
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,070
Okay, I appreciate it.

155
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,480
It's not that I'm looking for a thank you.

156
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,150
So, what are you going to do about it?

157
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,720
- What do you mean?
- Unbelievable.

158
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,890
After what you did to my hand,

159
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,920
are you just going to play innocent
and act as if you got away with it?

160
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
Are you trying to weasel
your way out of this?

161
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,460
Hey, who says I'm doing that?

162
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
But that's exactly how you're acting.

163
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,330
What do you think my family will do
if they find out it was you who did this?

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,300
- Keep it down. They'll hear you.
- Hey! What are you doing?

165
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,310
You really are a repeat offender,
aren't you?

166
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,280
Who said you could do that?

167
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,420
Stop being a baby and get up.

168
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,090
Does that give you the right
to be so violent?

169
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,160
I think I need to go to the hospital.

170
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,430
I'm not even married yet!
Will you take responsibility?

171
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
What?

172
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,170
What's going on?

173
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,940
Did I just hear someone scream?

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,510
What? A scream?
No, you didn't hear anything.

175
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,910
Lawyer Kang, didn't hear someone scream?

176
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,810
No, I didn't hear a thing.

177
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,210
It's nothing.

178
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,180
It's nothing.

179
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,670
Hong Ju, that's enough. Stop crying.

180
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,810
You know the Chairman
has high blood pressure.

181
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,410
Chairman,
please don't mind what Hong Ju said.

182
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,710
It was an order from CEO Chae,
so it's not like we can just reverse it.

183
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,080
Don't you worry.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,490
I'll have a word with CEO Chae.

185
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,660
I only reacted that way
because I thought you knew, Chairman.

186
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,130
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,660
You have so much on your plate already,
and I've just added to your worries.

188
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,050
Here you go.

189
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,580
How is it?

190
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,390
- Feeling a surge of energy?
- Yes.

191
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,160
There's nothing better than this
for restoring your energy.

192
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,930
Welcome home, ma'am.

193
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,830
- I'm home, Father.
- You. Come and sit down.

194
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,970
If it isn't urgent,
I'll just go change and come back down.

195
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,940
Are you trying to defy me?

196
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,040
No, sir.

197
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,410
Seeing Assistant Manager Jin is here,

198
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,170
I assume this is about
the personnel transfer.

199
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,480
I will come down and explain
after I get changed.

200
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,050
My goodness, CEO Chae.

201
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,780
To think she'd defy the Chairman.

202
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,750
She's certainly gotten bold.

203
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,700
Time for a little something sweet,
isn't it?

204
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
What is this?

205
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,670
Calculating sales gives you
the biggest dopamine rush, right?

206
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,670
You deserve a little reward,
like some ice cream.

207
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,680
Here, have some.

208
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,820
- I'm fine.
- You're such a stick-in-the-mud.

209
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,420
Are you sure you'll beat
my mom's challenge to double the sales?

210
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,460
I hope you don't get fired, Chef Kang.
I want you to stick around.

211
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,160
I, Ma Seo Rin, am rooting for you.

212
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,970
You're interrupting my work, so get out.

213
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Do I need to make a recording
of myself saying that?

214
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,540
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,580
I don't have hepatitis
or any other viruses.

216
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,280
I even added my special flavor enhancer.
You're welcome, right?

217
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,650
I'm warning you.

218
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,220
Pull a stunt like that again,
and I won't forgive you.

219
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,890
You're just playing hard to get.
I know you liked it.

220
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,700
You know, when a girl makes a move,
it's classy to just play along.

221
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,430
- This woman, I swear...
- Okay. All right.

222
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,270
I'll get out of your hair,

223
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,600
so hurry and eat this before it melts.

224
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,410
Try all you want.
It's not going to work on me.

225
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
What's this about transferring
Assistant Manager Jin...

226
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,290
to the India branch?

227
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,660
I don't understand...

228
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,990
why you're so upset, Father.

229
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,590
You don't understand?

230
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,230
You know very well
why you're shipping off...

231
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,500
Assistant Manager Jin,
a good employee, to India.

232
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,130
And you say you don't understand?

233
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,970
You're doing this to defy me
just because I brought up Mrs. Yeom.

234
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,040
Since when have you defied me like this?

235
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Father.

236
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,740
Assistant Manager Jin's transfer is not
under my sole authority.

237
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,680
And Father,
instead of being disappointed with me,

238
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,880
you should be reprimanding
Assistant Manager Jin,

239
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,220
who is sitting right outside.

240
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,820
- What?
- Just look at...

241
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,520
Assistant Manager Jin's behavior.

242
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,930
We're a major corporation,
not some mom-and-pop shop.

243
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,000
She's defying a decision made
by the board and the CEO...

244
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,030
and running to the Chairman to complain.

245
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,730
Is that appropriate for an employee?

246
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,400
Would I want to have someone like that
working directly for me?

247
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,170
CEO Chae!

248
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,340
So you're determined to get rid of
Assistant Manager Jin...

249
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,910
by sending her to India?

250
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,710
It's not about kicking her out, Father.

251
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,650
These assignments are directly tied
to an employee's career path.

252
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,220
And it wasn't just Assistant Manager Jin
who was transferred.

253
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,890
So?

254
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,030
Are you telling me you're going to defy me
and refuse to reverse the transfer order?

255
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,530
Reversing the transfer order...

256
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,370
could have a negative impact
on the company.

257
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,430
If we issue a transfer
and then immediately rescind it,

258
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,940
how could our employees possibly
trust the company?

259
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,370
- What now?
- It would confuse our employees,

260
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,980
and it could lower their morale
and loyalty to the organization.

261
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,120
We'd just be shooting ourselves
in the foot.

262
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,890
Father, please reconsider.

263
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,330
CEO Chae, how could you?

264
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,360
I've given up my days off
and worked around the clock,

265
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,030
and you know how hard I've worked
for this company.

266
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,270
Where are your manners?

267
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,240
Have you no class,
listening in on a private conversation?

268
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,470
Yeom San Wol,
is this how you raised your daughter?

269
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,880
No, it's just...

270
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,910
I'm so sorry, Chairman.
She was just so distraught.

271
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,550
But, CEO Chae,
Hong Ju never even took a day off.

272
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,120
I can guarantee you,
she lives and breathes for her job.

273
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,820
You have no idea how hard
Hong Ju has worked.

274
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,490
That's what we pay her for.

275
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,690
As if she did something so extraordinary.

276
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,470
Father, I know
how fond you are of Assistant Manager Jin.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,640
I feel the same way, as does the board.

278
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,670
This decision was made out of
our deep appreciation for her.

279
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Two years will fly by,
and it will be a great experience for her.

280
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,380
We made this decision
with her long-term career in mind,

281
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,880
so please try to understand.

282
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
If you'll excuse me.

283
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,330
CEO Chae.

284
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:40,300
CEO Chae, please, I'm begging you.
Spare Hong Ju just this once.

285
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,870
Please?

286
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,540
- And how exactly should I spare her?
- What?

287
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,650
Come on, you know exactly what I mean.

288
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,480
Hong Ju isn't strong.
She can't work in a place so far away.

289
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,590
You know that, don't you?

290
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,390
CEO Chae, please, I'm begging you.

291
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,690
San Wol. What did I tell you?

292
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,360
- Yes?
- I told you to never come here again...

293
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,760
and to stay away from the Chairman.
I believe I made that clear.

294
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Well...

295
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,400
- You did.
- And yet?

296
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,770
Fine.

297
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,040
So, as punishment for that,

298
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,280
you're exiling Hong Ju
to some faraway land.

299
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,650
But don't you have a heart?

300
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,150
Doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?

301
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,650
You're supposed to
forgive a first mistake.

302
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,850
A mistake? You call that a mistake?

303
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,890
Was getting close to the Chairman
a mistake?

304
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,460
Want me to record that
and play it for him?

305
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,960
You know that's not what I meant.
Why are you doing this?

306
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,960
Shut up. You should know better.
What are you playing at?

307
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,370
Do you think this is a joke?
Don't you get it the first time?

308
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,640
- Hwa Young.
- I made it crystal clear...

309
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,140
you were to stay away from the Chairman.

310
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,340
But you completely ignored me,

311
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,380
and while here asking for a favor,
you were seducing him?

312
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,780
And you have the gall
to call that a mistake?

313
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,050
I was wrong.

314
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,950
Wrong about what, exactly?

315
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,520
If you just put Hong Ju back
where she belongs,

316
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,530
I'll never...

317
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,460
go anywhere near the Chairman again.

318
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,630
I mean it this time.

319
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,530
Do you think...

320
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,100
I'd choose my love over my own daughter?

321
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,370
"Love?"

322
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,340
Did you just say "love"
with that filthy mouth of yours?

323
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,710
Say it again. I dare you.

324
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,850
You "love" the Chairman?

325
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,490
That's right. Love.

326
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,620
I love the Chairman.

327
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,090
That's enough!

328
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Chairman.

329
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,090
Chairman...

330
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,230
Yes.

331
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,780
Honey, is something on your mind lately?

332
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,670
Honey.

333
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
Yes?

334
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,410
Did you say something?

335
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,310
I asked if something was on your mind.

336
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,080
Why are you so spaced out?
What could you be thinking about?

337
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,650
What's going on with you lately?

338
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,510
It's nothing.

339
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,980
It's just a seasonal thing.

340
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,040
The Professor was here by himself
a few days ago, too.

341
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,960
The house feels so empty without the kids.

342
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,500
They'll be getting married
and moving out before we know it.

343
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,130
What will we do then?

344
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,500
What do you mean? We'll just go on living,
the way we always have.

345
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,010
By the way, I heard
a philharmonic orchestra was coming.

346
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,010
Honey, we should go.

347
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,920
Okay, I'll look into getting tickets.

348
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,920
CEO Chae is here.

349
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,630
I'm just going to step out for one minute.

350
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,400
Where are you going at this hour?

351
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,130
I just need some fresh air.
I feel suffocated.

352
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,310
What's gotten into him?

353
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,910
Wait, you got a job here?

354
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,470
Yes.

355
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,540
You have to start small to make it big.

356
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
CEO Chae.

357
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
What?

358
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,050
Professor.

359
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,960
You've had a lot to drink.
You should stop now.

360
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,230
Are you worried about me?

361
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,630
The only person in this whole world
who worries about me...

362
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,540
is you, Professor.

363
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,840
Did something happen?

364
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,940
You seem to be drinking more than usual,
CEO Chae.

365
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,240
There's always something with work.

366
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,850
Today, I was just so unbearably lonely...

367
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,280
that I was about to ask
the next person I saw...

368
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,550
to be my drinking buddy.

369
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,060
Thank you for appearing
like my Prince Charming.

370
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,630
Why is it, Professor,

371
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,340
that whenever I'm at my most desperate,

372
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,510
you always show up right on time?

373
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,340
See? You really are like a prince.

374
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,580
Here to save Sleeping Beauty?

375
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,680
That's right.

376
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,860
If you kiss me on the lips,

377
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,470
I'll finally awaken from my slumber.

378
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,170
And after that,

379
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,710
what happens next in the story?

380
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,830
Hello, I'm Oh Tae Pyung.

381
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,990
I've heard about you.

382
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,840
We have a lot of regulars here.
So an outfit like that...

383
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
We're honored to be here.

384
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,180
We just came to introduce ourselves
to you today.

385
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,780
Starting tomorrow,
we'll be dressed to impress.

386
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,050
Is he your manager?

387
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Pardon?

388
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,590
Yes. He's my manager.

389
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,290
Give me a break.

390
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,120
I heard this will be
your first time on stage.

391
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,200
You start from the bottom
and work your way up.

392
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Got it?

393
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,170
Yes, sir!

394
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes, sir!

395
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,090
All right.

396
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,390
Jang Mi,

397
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,860
what did you think about
what Lawyer Kang suggested earlier?

398
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,070
With side dishes this delicious,

399
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,700
I feel like just selling them on their own
is a missed opportunity.

400
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,940
- A business opportunity?
- Yes.

401
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,140
We order meal deliveries at work,

402
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,580
but they're loaded with artificial flavors
and don't taste so great.

403
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,110
Half the time, I'm not even sure
if I should be eating it.

404
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,980
If you started a boxed lunch delivery,
I think it would be a massive hit.

405
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,590
Boxed lunch delivery?

406
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,120
Dad, I'm all for it.

407
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,460
He even said he'd take care of...

408
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,360
the permits, health department,
and all the legal stuff.

409
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,130
But that'll be tough. Will you be okay?

410
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,270
Of course. I've got your stamina, don't I?

411
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,670
Right.

412
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,610
Let's save up quickly
so you can study abroad.

413
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,970
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to support you.

414
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,340
Let's just work a little harder, okay?

415
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,640
It's not hard work.

416
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,350
I love doing this, Dad.

417
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,490
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

418
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Yes.

419
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,530
Again?

420
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,700
Is that really true?

421
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,670
How did this happen?
Yes, I understand. Okay.

422
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,110
Dad?

423
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,610
Gosh, look.

424
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
This...

425
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,980
What's going on?

426
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,250
The banner's gone again?

427
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,750
Yes. I'm positive about this now.

428
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,790
I'm positive it's the work of the jerks
who did that to your mother.

429
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,080
(The First Man)

430
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,480
Maybe the culprit is still living
around Taean.

431
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,280
Should we put the banner back up?

432
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
How about this?

433
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,850
You're resigning?

434
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,720
You're leaving Dream Hotel...

435
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,920
to be unemployed and live with your mom?

436
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,860
I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.

437
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,160
A singer I back is performing here today,
and he insisted that I come.

438
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,900
When he starts singing, make sure you clap
really loud for him, okay?

439
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
