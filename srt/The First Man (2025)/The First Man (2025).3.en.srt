1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,410
- Come in, quick!
- How long has she been in labor?

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,480
- About an hour.
- Okay, let me examine her.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,450
Breathe slowly.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,390
That's it. Breathe slowly.

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,900
(Episode 3)

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,930
Oh, it sounds like the baby's here.
It's twins.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,070
- What? What do you mean?
- I'm telling you, it's twins!

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,940
There's not one but two!

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,830
I don't need two babies.

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,930
Well, what can you do?
She already had two.

11
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,840
This is getting complicated.

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
I didn't want to raise a child
in the first place.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,070
Since it's two babies, not just one,

14
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,610
- you'll have to pay me double.
- What did you say?

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,780
You have beautiful baby girls.

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,480
Twins.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,220
Girls? Not a boy?

18
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,450
Thank you for everything.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,050
Congratulations. Mom and the babies
are healthy, so don't worry.

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,540
Hey, Kang Hyuk, we have a problem.

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,580
Jung Suk Hee had twin girls.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,150
Two, not one! What are we going to do?

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,980
Hey, you said you'd take care of it,
didn't you?

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,550
So you handle it!

25
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,350
Gosh.

26
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,520
Why can't anything just go smoothly!

27
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,940
If it's certain
that it's Dong Seok's child,

28
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,540
for how poorly I've treated you...

29
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,780
I'll make it all up to you.

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,780
Just focus on having a healthy baby.

31
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,080
But Chairman Ma thinks
I'm only having one baby.

32
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,650
What do I do?

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
I only need one baby.

34
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,960
Maybe I should send one baby
to the mental hospital with Jung Suk Hee.

35
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,730
No, I can't do that.

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,270
What am I going to do?

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
We're in big trouble.

38
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,810
What now?

39
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,440
I think Chairman Ma met with
the director of your OB-GYN clinic.

40
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,180
What? And?

41
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,450
Did Chairman Ma find out
I had a stillbirth at another hospital?

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,390
No, I doubt they shared anything.

43
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,050
Doctors can't just disclose
patient information.

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,060
So he still doesn't know, right?

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,460
Right.
When he asked if you'd switched hospitals,

46
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,360
I told him we were unhappy with our doctor
at the old place...

47
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,200
and said we were looking for a new one.
I just came up with something.

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,340
Why is that old geezer
suddenly asking about that?

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,640
Is he onto us?

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,440
I don't think so.

51
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,180
It seemed like he just wanted to ask
the director to take special care of you.

52
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,820
The other day he was questioning if it was
his son's child. Why the change of heart?

53
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,150
So now he's praying for me
to have a safe delivery?

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,890
That fickle old man.

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,460
Anyway, I made up an excuse for now,

56
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,760
but it looks like Chairman Ma is going
to arrange a hospital for your delivery.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,300
- What are we going to do?
- This is insane!

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,170
You're little angels, my absolute angels.

59
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,740
So beautiful, my daughters.

60
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,940
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,250
Mommy needs to give you names.
What should they be?

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,950
My little Tok Hee has a mole.

63
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,790
How about that.

64
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,960
Now I can tell you two apart
by this mole, right?

65
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,400
With the way things are, we have to hurry.
We're running out of time.

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm worried Chairman Ma is going
to catch on.

67
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Kang Hyuk.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,540
Go to Seoul and watch Chairman Ma.
Whatever you do, don't let him come here.

69
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,810
He doesn't know I'm here,

70
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,280
but that old man has a knack
for sniffing out trouble,

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,680
so be extra careful.

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,520
Don't make a move until I get back.

73
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,250
The mental hospital
to lock up Jung Suk Hee...

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,690
You've got it all arranged, right?

75
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,460
Yes, don't worry.

76
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,090
Kang Hyuk.

77
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,890
You get rid of...

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,000
the other baby.

79
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,970
She's a child
who never should have been born.

80
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,970
Having another identical child
in the world...

81
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,140
is too big a risk with Chairman Ma.

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,980
I absolutely can't risk it.

83
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,360
Dong Seok.

84
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,430
Our children...

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
I'll raise them for the both of us.

86
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,570
I'll do my absolute best.

87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,240
So please...

88
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,910
Please, Dong Seok...

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,180
Please come back to me, safe and sound.

90
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,080
Dong Seok.

91
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,090
No matter how long it takes,

92
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,690
I'll be waiting.

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,260
Go ahead, Jung Suk Hee.

94
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,760
You can wait all you want
in that mental hospital.

95
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,730
And you'd better take a good long look
at your children now.

96
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,760
It'll be the last time you ever see them.

97
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,100
Ok Hee.

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
This is...

99
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,640
a lucky charm bracelet
Mommy made just for you.

100
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,810
Tok Hee.

101
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,850
This bracelet will bring
you both good luck.

102
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,820
While you were in my tummy,
Mommy knitted these for you.

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,230
Wear these bracelets and always be happy.

104
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,840
<i>When Mommy's in the island's shade</i>

105
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,390
<i>Gathering oysters from the sea</i>

106
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,860
<i>Baby is left all alone</i>

107
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,900
Alright. We're home.

108
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,630
Okay, Tae Sook, down you go.

109
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,570
And you, too, Tae Pyung. Come on.
There we go.

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,380
Alright, let's go inside.

111
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,410
Hey...

112
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,010
How about we go visit...

113
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,880
your Aunt Suk Hee tomorrow?

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,390
- Do you guys remember your Aunt Suk Hee?
- Yes, I remember her!

115
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
You do?

116
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,890
Don't be silly. How could you remember?
You were just a baby.

117
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,830
But Dad, I remember her.

118
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,560
She was super pretty
and really nice to us.

119
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,930
That's right. When you two were born,
your Aunt Suk Hee...

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,370
made these lucky bracelets
and put them on you.

121
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,140
Your Aunt Suk Hee will be so surprised
to see how much you've grown.

122
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,880
- Come on, let's get inside.
- Yes! Let's go!

123
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,980
Let's go.

124
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,630
Which baby should I take?

125
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,980
Goodness.

126
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,450
Nurse?

127
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,650
What brings you here this late at night?

128
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,890
I was worried about you and the babies.

129
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,990
I see. I'm fine.

130
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,560
And the babies seem fine, too.

131
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,330
That's a relief.

132
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm stronger than I look.

133
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,600
But, Nurse...

134
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,640
Have we met somewhere before?

135
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,840
- What?
- You just look so familiar.

136
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,980
Where have I seen you before?

137
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,550
I've never seen you before.

138
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,690
You should get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

139
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,090
Gosh.

140
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,760
She said that nurse had a nasty temper.

141
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,130
Looks like the old lady was right.

142
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,200
What was that?
She didn't recognize me, did she?

143
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,780
What's wrong, sweetie?

144
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,810
You're running a fever.

145
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,980
This isn't good.
We need to go to a hospital.

146
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,660
And where do you think you're going?

147
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,830
I think Tok Hee has a fever.
We have to get to a hospital.

148
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,930
The hospital?

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,630
- Why? Is there a reason I shouldn't go?
- Absolutely.

150
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,170
What do you mean?

151
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,010
It would be better if I took the baby
to the hospital for you.

152
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,180
You're a new mother who needs to recover.

153
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,410
You shouldn't be going outside.

154
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,380
You'd do that?
That would be a huge help, thank you.

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Please, don't mention it.

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,290
- It's just part of my job.
- Hold on, let me just check her diaper.

157
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,130
Kang Hyuk, you're on your way, right?
Get here quickly. We need to hurry.

158
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,740
I'll be on my way.
It seems my work here is done.

159
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,250
You know to take this to your grave,
don't you?

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,920
- Of course.
- Forget everything that happened here.

161
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,260
And you know what'll happen
if you run that mouth of yours, don't you?

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,460
Gosh, I said I get it.

163
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
You promised to pay me double.

164
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,400
I wonder if you put a little extra
in there for me.

165
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,210
But what should I put all this in?

166
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,940
The old lady must have a bag
or something, right?

167
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm just curious about something.

168
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,290
What are you going to do
about the mother and the babies?

169
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,420
I'm just really curious.

170
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,760
Listen! That's none of your business.

171
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,570
The nerve of her!
How dare she talk to an elder like that!

172
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,970
You told me all I had to do was make sure
she delivered the baby safely.

173
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
Don't tell me...

174
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,110
- you're not stealing the baby, are you?
- Shut it!

175
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,410
What? Steal the baby?

176
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,910
No, I'm just saying I'm curious.
They're twins,

177
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,180
so are you taking both of them,
or just one?

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,380
The mother doesn't seem to have a clue.

179
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,020
- What about the mother?
- I already told you.

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,060
It's none of your business!

181
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,930
Don't you get it?
Take the money and just do what I say.

182
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,090
But still...

183
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,430
If this is what's happening, that makes me
Chae Hwa Young's accomplice.

184
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,500
- So I have a right to know!
- Chae Hwa Young?

185
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,000
She's not a nurse? She's Chae Hwa Young?

186
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,870
Chae Hwa Young, the actress?

191
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,950
But, Nurse...

192
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,960
Have we met somewhere before?

193
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,290
- What?
- You just look so familiar.

194
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,400
Where have I seen you before?

195
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,370
I've never seen you before.

196
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,440
What you need to understand is...

197
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,170
that what happened here is a secret
you take to your grave.

198
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,010
Don't you forget it.

199
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,640
If you so much as open your mouth...

200
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,950
your son won't get his treatment
and will never live a normal life. Got it?

201
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,350
Understand?

202
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,350
Of course I'll keep it secret.

203
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,550
Otherwise, my son won't get
his treatment...

204
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,260
and I'll end up in prison.

205
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,890
But the thing I'm curious about is
whether you're taking both twins,

206
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,560
or what you'll do with the other one.
That's what I want to know.

207
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,030
- You're really starting to push it.
- Okay, I get it.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,700
You look like you could eat me alive.
I'm leaving.

209
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,150
I don't know
if I can trust that old woman.

210
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,190
Anyway, to get this done,
I need Kang Hyuk to get here fast.

211
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
Right.

212
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,230
The remaining baby is one
that never should have been born.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,060
You have no reason to blame me.

214
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,600
It's all because you were born
to the wrong mother.

215
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,410
Little one. Don't cry.

216
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,510
We have to get out of here.

217
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,520
You can't make a sound.

218
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,450
I can't let Chae Hwa Young
take you from me.

219
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,560
Before Chairman Ma starts looking
for the hospital...

220
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,260
I'd better make my move first.

221
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,720
- Father.
- Yes.

222
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,450
Isn't your due date coming up soon?

223
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,890
I have wonderful news.
I just had the baby,

224
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,690
- and you're the first person I called.
- You did?

225
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,000
You had the baby? And the baby's healthy?

226
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,070
Yes. Perfectly healthy.

227
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,510
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

228
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Please, Mommy needs your help.

229
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,010
We have to escape from here...

230
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,380
so please don't make a sound.

231
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,230
Yes, Father.

232
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,570
It's a healthy baby girl, not a boy.

233
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,110
A daughter, not a son?

234
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,210
Yes. You know how they say
the first daughter looks like her father?

235
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,110
She's the spitting image of Dong Seok.

236
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,090
It's as if he's right here beside me.

237
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,390
Is that right?

238
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,920
I never understood what it meant
to be so happy you see stars,

239
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,930
but I get it now that I've seen
our little princess.

240
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,670
So you thought it was a boy,
but it turned out to be a girl?

241
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,540
Everyone said it had to be a boy
from the shape of my belly,

242
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,010
so that's what I assumed.

243
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,040
To be honest, it didn't matter
to me if it was a boy or a girl,

244
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,550
so it's my fault
for not asking the doctor.

245
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,150
You've been through a lot.

246
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,620
When will I get to hold my granddaughter?

247
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,290
I haven't fully recovered yet.

248
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,590
I need some time to recover.

249
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,310
They say I have to be careful
for the first three weeks.

250
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,040
I'll come and see you soon, Father.

251
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,630
Jung Suk Hee, I'm coming in.

252
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,830
Where's Jung Suk Hee?

253
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,600
Where did she go?

254
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,070
No.

255
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,210
No!

256
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,920
Please, my babies, be quiet.

257
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,660
We have to get away from here. Please.

258
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,670
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

259
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,970
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

260
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,170
Where are you?

261
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,210
Where is Jung Suk Hee?

262
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,110
What? Did she overhear everything?

263
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,210
Is that why she caught on and ran away?

264
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,450
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

265
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,560
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

266
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,760
Where did you hide?

267
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,330
Jung Suk Hee!

268
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,630
Consider today the day
you and your children die.

269
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,300
If you heard all my secrets,

270
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,100
then even a mental hospital
is too good for you.

271
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,970
Where are you?

272
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,940
Jung Suk Hee!

273
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,740
Jung Suk Hee!

274
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,590
She couldn't have gotten far
with the babies.

275
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,120
She has to be hiding somewhere nearby.

276
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,480
I told you to hurry!
Do you ever listen to me?

277
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,180
What took you so long?

278
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,550
What happened? What's wrong?

279
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,520
This is bad.

280
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,220
That Jung Suk Hee took the babies
and disappeared.

281
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,090
She must have figured everything out.
She just vanished into thin air.

282
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,630
What do you mean, she figured it out?

283
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,100
How did this happen?

284
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,670
Is that really the problem right now?
We have to find Jung Suk Hee, and fast.

285
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
Or else this whole thing will fall apart.

286
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,700
We have to find her
and shut her up, no matter what.

287
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,510
She couldn't have gotten far.
I'll find her, so don't worry.

288
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,240
How can I not worry?

289
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,080
Just find her, now!

290
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,650
Find her! My life depends on it.

291
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,620
- Everyone, this way.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
Chae Hwa Young.

293
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,230
I'm sure I saw an article
saying she was pregnant,

294
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,470
so what happened to her own baby?

295
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,370
Why would she want to take
my children now?

296
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,510
No one knew I was pregnant.
How could she have known?

297
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,410
Chae Hwa Young...

298
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,850
I never knew you could be so cruel.

299
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,720
No, little ones.
Please, don't make a sound.

300
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,430
Babies, please help Mommy.
We have to survive.

301
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,460
Dong Seok. Help me.

302
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,970
Hush now, little ones.

303
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,720
Jung Suk Hee.

304
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,560
I lost my baby because of you.
All because of you.

305
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,870
If it hadn't been for you back then,

306
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,910
my baby would still be alive.

307
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,950
So, your baby is mine now.

308
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,220
I will find the baby. I swear it.

309
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,090
That baby is my lifeline.

310
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,270
Is anybody there?

311
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,040
Help! Is anyone here? Please, help me!

312
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,110
What do I do?

313
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,320
Hello? Is anyone out there?

314
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,120
Wait! Hold on.

315
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,620
- Did you guys hear that?
- Help me!

316
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,260
Is anybody there?

317
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,990
Somebody, save me!

318
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,730
Help me! Over here! Is anybody here?

319
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,100
Somebody, save me!

320
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,110
I have to get to town.
I'll be safer around other people.

321
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,380
Please, let there be a car passing by.

322
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,360
You still have a high fever.
What am I going to do?

323
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,830
Sweetheart, please don't be sick.

324
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,570
No, little ones.
Please, be strong for Mommy.

325
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,470
I will never let Chae Hwa Young
take you from me.

326
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,940
Hush now.

327
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,070
Quiet, quiet.

328
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,770
A pay phone!

329
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,340
My babies, we're saved.

330
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,860
- Hey, there she is! Over there!
- Gosh, darn it!

331
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,570
Where's my money?

332
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm sure I wrapped the money
in my handkerchief.

333
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,380
This is bad.

334
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,180
We have to find Jung Suk Hee, and fast.

335
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,950
We have to find her
and shut her up, no matter what.

336
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,360
Now what do I do?

337
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,560
I need a coin to make a call.

338
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,230
Babies, what are we going to do now?

339
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,320
Is anybody there?

340
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,120
There she is!

341
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,740
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

342
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,040
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

343
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,790
(The First Man)

344
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,720
Stop the car! Please, hurry!
If they catch us, we're dead!

345
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,960
Should I have let him
marry the girl he loved?

346
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,960
Maybe I should try to find her, even now.

347
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:50,330
If that sly fox Chairman Ma finds out,
