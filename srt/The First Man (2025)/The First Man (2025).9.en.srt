00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,420
Suk Hee...

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,150
Be careful! Oh my.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,160
Are you okay? Here, get up.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,430
All right. Oh, dear. That must hurt.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,800
Jung Suk Hee...

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,370
It really is Jung Suk Hee!

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,730
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Yes, that's right.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,300
There's no doubt it's her.

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,470
How can this be?

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,380
How is Jung Suk Hee still alive?

(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

15
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,280
But something's different about her.

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,150
Did she hit her head?

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,360
Let's go.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,590
Here, let me take that.

(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,260
Right. The guitar!

21
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,290
Where is my head?

(Four Missed Calls, Pervert Guitarist)

23
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,170
This guy couldn't even wait
and called me yesterday.

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,510
Lawyer Kang, I heard you won the case.

25
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,640
Of course I did, Mom.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,510
And you got a nice, fat bonus
this time, right?

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,150
- About that...
- Not again!

28
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,480
You not only waived the bonus,
but you cut the legal fees too?

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,590
Mom, I felt bad for her.
Her child is still so young.

30
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,990
It seemed she could barely make ends meet
with the alimony.

31
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,030
Kang Baek Ho! Lawyer Kang!

32
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,860
Snap out of it!

33
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,000
We're not running a charity here!

34

If you give in to every sob story,
what happens to us?

35
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,870
We’re barely managing rent
and payroll as it is.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,770
Yes, I know.

37
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,810
My alumni reunion's coming up.

38
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,180
I'll go and really hustle
for some new clients.

39
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,010
Gosh, I can't tell if you're naive
or just a pushover.

40
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,280
How do you expect to survive
in this dog-eat-dog world?

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,590
As your mother, I'm truly worried.

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm leaving.

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,320
Okay, take care.

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,030
Goodness, honestly.

(Guitar Jerk)

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,140
- Hello?
- I see you called yesterday.

47
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,540
Don't think I'm a deadbeat.
I have no intention of stiffing you.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,410
Then why did you ignore my calls?

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,910
I was too busy to take it.

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,340
That's why I'm calling you now, right?

51
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,310
You have no right to give me
that attitude, you know?

52
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,620
You should be groveling for forgiveness.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,690
Don't treat me like a criminal.

54
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,290
I told you I'm not trying to stiff you.

55
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,530
Fine. So how are you going to pay
for my guitar?

56
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,030
I'm planning to consult a lawyer about it.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,330
- A lawyer?
- Would it be wrong to?

58
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,400
It's not like it's completely unusable.

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,540
It's ridiculous to pay
the full amount you asked for.

60
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,140
Does he take me for a pushover?

61
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,510
And?

62
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,950
I'll call you after I've consulted
with my lawyer, so just wait.

63
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,680
Look, you really are clueless, aren't you?

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,150
Do you have any idea how much it costs
for one consultation with a lawyer?

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,590
You don't have to worry about that.

66
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,360
Is that so?

67
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,700
Let me save you the consultation fee
and tell you myself...

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,170
I'm good!
I'll call you later, so just wait.

69
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,600
Hello? Hey!

70
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,570
This woman is unbelievable.

71
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm a lawyer. Who is she going to ask?

72
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,790
- Suk Hee.
- Chocolate.

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,830
This will give you cavities.

74
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,230
It's not good for you,
so let's get it next time, okay?

75
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,800
But it's yummy. Suk Hee likes chocolate.

76
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,070
All right, just for today, then.
No more tomorrow, okay?

77
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,410
- Okay.
- Promise.

78
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,180
Promise. Pinky swear.

79
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
- There.
- Pinky swear.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
Okay, Suk Hee, let's go now.

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,650
What? She has the mind of a child.

82
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,320
Then again, after falling off a cliff,
it would be weirder if she were unharmed.

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,790
You shouldn't do that.
Come on, we have to go now.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,630
Then what about
the other child Jung Suk Hee had?

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,000
What happened to her?

86
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,150
- Hey, Tae Pyung!
- Hey, Jang Mi.

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,150
I can't make deliveries today.

88
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,550
No, it's not that.

89
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,850
Didn't you say you have a friend
who's a lawyer?

90
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,950
A lawyer?

91
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,260
Yes, I do.
He's a really good friend of mine.

92
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,630
- Why do you ask?
- I need to ask for some advice,

93
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,930
so could you set something up for me?

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,900
Really?
Of course. That's no problem at all.

95
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,670
Let me tell you. He's got a heart of gold.

96
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,240
He can't stand to see people struggling.

97
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,340
- Really?
- As a matter of fact,

98
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,040
I've already told him a lot about you,
so he'll be happy to help.

99
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,810
Ask him anything.

100
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,180
- I'll hook you up.
- Perfect. Thanks, Tae Pyung.

(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

103
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,560
Hey, Tae Pyung.
I was just about to call you, actually.

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,360
How did things go at the police station?

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,760
It's all taken care of.

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,800
- That's a relief.
- Anyway,

107
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,240
my sister wanted to ask you something.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you have a minute?

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,540
You mean that pretty sister of yours?

110
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Hey, for her? Of course I do.

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,010
Go on, ask him.

112
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
Hey...

113
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,580
Gosh.

114
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,450
Why couldn't she just talk to him here?

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,460
Is it something I'm not supposed to hear?

116
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,530
Hello.

117
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,760
I've heard so much about you
from my brother, Tae Pyung.

118
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,930
I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

119
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,440
I know you're busy,
so I won't take up too much of your time.

120
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,970
It's no problem at all.

121
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,310
What kind of problem are you having?

122
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,940
I'll be happy to answer as best as I can.

123
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,840
I think I might have...

124
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
accidentally damaged someone's property.

125
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,650
But just a tiny little bit.

126
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,150
Someone's property?

127
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,330
Knock, knock.

128
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,580
Under Article 750 of the Civil Code,
if you damage another person's property,

129
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,880
you are indeed liable for damages.

130
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,380
How much would I be liable for?

131
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,080
Don't tell me I have to cover all of it.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,220
Let's see.

133
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,690
If it's repairable,
then probably just the cost of repairs.

134
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,920
Did you happen to scratch a luxury car?

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,620
No, it's not that.

136
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,490
I just need to cover
the cost of repairs, right?

137
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,270
But the other party is demanding
an outrageous amount of compensation.

138
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,670
That's why I couldn't just stand for it...

139
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,600
and decided to seek your legal advice.

140
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,270
It wasn't intentional, was it?

141
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,140
Property damage is a criminal offense.

142
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,080
Of course not! It was an accident.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Gosh, my ears.

144
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,750
Her voice sounds really familiar.

145
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,250
It's a huge relief
that it wasn't intentional.

146
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,350
If you'd like a detailed consultation,
please feel free to stop by the office.

147
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,320
Since you're Tae Pyung's sister,
I'll give you an in-depth consultation.

148
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,800
I will. Thank you so much.

149
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,030
All right then. Goodbye.

150
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,910
I just have to cover the repair costs.
That's it.

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Wait a minute.

(Oh Jang Mi: 543.21 dollars)

153
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,950
I put most of it into the house and shop,
so I barely have anything left.

154
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,450
What am I going to do?

155
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,300
Hey, something urgent came up,
and I'm in a bit of a jam.

156
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,370

any part-time jobs available?

(Law Firm Leeho)

158
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,800
Why does her voice sound so familiar?

159
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,240
Could I have met
Tae Pyung's sister before?

160
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
No, that can't be it.

161
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,340
I heard she has a beautiful name,
Jang Mi.

162
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,710
There's no way I've met her.

163
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Right.

164
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,220
So...

165
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,850
are you here to check up on me
and see if the event prep is going well?

166
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,420
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who brought you on board.

167
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,360
You'd better not forget it.

168
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,490
Gosh, you're so cynical and uptight.

169
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,060
Then again,
I guess that's part of your charm.

170
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,630
Cut the nonsense.

171
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,140
Tell me why you're here.

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,940
I heard CEO Chae isn't happy with you.

173
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,310
And that she challenged you
to double sales in two months?

174
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,850
She's probably trying to push you out
because I'm the one who recommended you.

175
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,720
Because you're not one of her people.

176
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,250
You came here
because you were worried about me?

177
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,820
Hardly. I have faith in you.

178
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,820
In fact, I'm sure I'll get a promotion,
thanks to you.

179
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,130
I'm glad we're on the same page.

180
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,100
But about Seo Rin...

181
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,070
It seems like
she has been hitting on you.

182
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,240
You don't need to concern yourself
with that.

183
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,450
- Grandpa!
- Hey there, kiddo.

184
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,820
You're not at the office today?

185
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,090
I skipped it to hang out
with you, Grandpa.

186
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,160
Don't tell me you're doing boring work.

187
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,730
Some things have to be done,
even if they're not fun, you know?

188
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
By the way, Seo Rin.

189
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,400
Do you have a crush on someone?

190
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,800
A crush?

191
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,510
You're my number one guy, Grandpa.

192
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,670
There is no one besides you.

193
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,940
I heard you liked that chef
at Chang Restaurant...

194
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,850
and that rumors about it
are all over the company.

195
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
That?

196
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,050
Yes, that's right.

197
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,890
Grandpa, I've finally found a guy
I really like.

198
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,430
Is that right?

199
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,430
Who's this guy
who stole your heart just like that?

200
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,470
Curious, aren't you?

201
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm really curious about him too.

202
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,470
A mysterious man is more attractive.

203
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,510
Right, Grandpa?

204
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,740
That's right.

205
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm curious too.

206
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,010
Should I bring him home to meet you?

207
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,410
No, that's all right.

208
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,420
The more mysterious a guy is,

209
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,820
half the fun is getting to know him
little by little, right?

210
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,490
Don't rush things.

211
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,020
Just enjoy the mystery for all its worth.

212
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,330
You think so?

213
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,560
And don't let on to your mother.

214
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,900
I have a feeling your mom...

215
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,900
won't be happy
if she finds out you're seeing someone.

216
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,800
You're right.

217
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,200
Grandpa, you're really...

218
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,410
in my corner.

219
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,780

(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

221
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,620
- You wanted to see me?
- Jung Suk Hee is alive.

222
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,550
- What?
- Why do I have to repeat myself?

223
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,190
Jung Suk Hee is alive!

224
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,860
I always had a bad feeling
since we never found a body.

225
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,920
And now this.

226
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,830
That's impossible.

227
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,230
If Jung Suk Hee is really alive,

228
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,030
why hasn't she gone to the police by now?

229
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,130
Her child was taken from her.
How could she stay silent after that?

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,870
That's my point.
The impossible has happened.

231
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,210
That's what you need to find out for me.

232
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,940
The accident might have messed
with her head.

233
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,850
She didn't seem normal.

234
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
Her head?

235
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,850
- What on earth are you talking about?
- I saw her clearly with my own two eyes.

236
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,020
So you go and confirm it for yourself.
Find out what's going on.

237
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,530
Most importantly,
find out about her family situation.

238
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,330
Jung Suk Hee should have died.

239
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,170
Her being alive...

240
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,470
means she could come for our throats
at any moment.

Go on, take your pick.

244
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,180

braised mackerel, braised lotus root,

and a spicy bellflower and cucumber salad.

Suk Hee, over here. This way.

- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry.

251
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,470
Suk Hee didn't do anything wrong.

252
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,640
I'm terribly sorry if we startled you.

253
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540

- Suk Hee.
- Hey, mister!

Suk Hee, it's not your fault, okay?
It's okay.

258
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,310
It's okay. Now, let's go.

259
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
No way.

260
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,920
That was definitely Jung Suk Hee.

so do it as soon as you can.

Right. I heard Chef Kang Jun Ho
is at Chang Restaurant now.

Really? You mean the celebrity chef,
Kang Jun Ho?

Oh Jang Mi,
are you a fan of Chef Kang Jun Ho, too?

270
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,830
A fan? I'm his biggest fan!

271
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,440
He's the one who earned
three Michelin stars in New York.

272

My biggest wish is to meet...

273
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,410
that famous and amazing
Chef Kang Jun Ho just once.

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,510
If that's the case,

275
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,310
you can see him at Chang Restaurant
in the Dream Hotel.

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,350
I heard he's the new head chef there...

277
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,810
and just got back from the States.

I see you're in a hurry
to ride on Seo Rin's coattails.

Director Ma also had
a crude way with words.

I suppose it's true that
daughters take after their mothers.

289

- Crude?
- My standards aren't that low.

you have nothing to worry about.

Did you look into everything?

297
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,300
Yes. As you saw for yourself,

298
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,810
it seems the accident caused her
to lose all her memories.

299
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,340
She lost her memories?

Yes! There we go.

Due to that accident,

304
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,000
it appears Jung Suk Hee has regressed
to the mental age of a five-year-old.

305
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,130
And so, she appears to have no memory
of that time whatsoever.

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
How can you be so sure of that?

307
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,670
Couldn't her memory come back at any time?

No.

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,320
CEO Chae must be busy.
She's not picking up.

313
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,620
She asked for
the family relationship certificate,

314
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,690
so I did.

315

But it doesn't look like
I'll see her today.

316
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,260
Why did she ask for
a family relationship certificate?

317
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,400
We were wondering the same thing.

318
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,540
You're back
from your part-time work already?

319
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,080
You should be resting.
What are you doing in the kitchen?

320
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,910
Because it's hard doing it alone, Dad.

when it comes to side dishes.

- Gimbap?
- We're supposed to visit the villa...

327
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,130
where your mom had her accident tomorrow.

328
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,060
That's right.

329
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,500

Why don't you start
by speaking with my team?

But it's at the stage
where it requires your final approval.

I appreciate you coming all this way,

342
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,310
but we'll have to make the decision
another time.

343
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,980
Yes, I see.

348
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,770
- Hold his hand tight and don't lose him.
- Okay.

349
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,770
- We're off.
- Okay.

350
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,640
Oh Bok Gil.

351
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,510
He grew up with Jung Suk Hee
in an orphanage.

352
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,210
They were as close as siblings,
but lost touch after he married.

353
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,220
His wife passed away from an illness
after having two children.

354
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,550
He married Jung Suk Hee
after her accident,

355
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,220
and they have a daughter.

356
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,520
So...

357
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,430
he doesn't know a thing, right?

358
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,630
Yes, that seems to be the case.

359
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,430
That makes sense.

360
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,900
That explains why
he's done nothing all this time.

361
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,920
Your mom ended up following Tae Pyung
to the market after all.

362
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,120
I guess Tae Pyung reminds Mom of you
when you were young.

363
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,420
Tae Pyung is my spitting image.

364
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,630
I guess that's why I'm so pretty
since I take after you too.

365
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,800
What?

366
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,970
Right.

367
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,850
Jung Suk Hee...

368
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,590
What am I going to do
if she gets her memory back?

369
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,890
It's possible, isn't it?

370
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,590
It's hard to say.

371
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,060
Since her brain damage made her regress
to the mental age of a five-year-old,

372
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,900
it's highly unlikely.

373
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,070
But she could have surgery or something
and be perfectly fine again, right?

374
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,700
I'd have to look into it,

375
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,940
- but I'd say the odds are against it.
- The odds are against it?

376
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,110
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

377
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,380
So since she's lost her mind,
she'll never remember me or the accident.

378
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,380
So I should just relax?
Is that what you're telling me?

379
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,650
For now,

380
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,120
I've assigned one of my best men to it,

381
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,090
so if things start to get dangerous,
I'll step in myself.

382
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,560
Of course you will.

383
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,260
This is all because you messed up
in the first place.

384
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,000
Who would have thought
Jung Suk Hee would survive?

385
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,870
I apologize.

386
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,340
What about the other twin from back then?

387
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,340
Are you sure that one died?

388
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,510
They never found the body.

389
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,510
What if that one is still alive, too?

390
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,180
Impossible. There's absolutely no way.

391
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,880
Jung Suk Hee may've been lucky to survive,

392
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,220
but that was a newborn baby,
only a few days old.

393
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,430
A baby that young fell off a cliff
into the river.

394
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,400
How could she possibly have survived?

395
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,200
That's just not possible,
so you don't need to worry.

396
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,470
And what about Jung Suk Hee's family?

397
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,580
- Did you look into them?
- Like I said before,

398
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,810
Oh Bok Gil already had a son
and a daughter with his first wife.

399
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,180
He seems to have remarried Jung Suk Hee
and had another daughter with her.

400
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,050
Her name is Oh Jang Mi.
She's a year younger than Seo Rin.

401
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
Oh Jang Mi...

402
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,820
If she's a year younger,

403
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,760
it means Jung Suk Hee got pregnant
right after the accident.

404
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,330
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

405
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,770
- Hop in.
- Okay.

406
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,110
Suk Hee, get in.

407
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,440
Scoot in. Where's Tae Pyung?

408
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,550
He said he couldn't go.
Apparently, someone needed to see him.

409
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,290
Does he think he's a businessman?
Who is he always meeting?

410
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,620
Tae Pyung is busy.
Tae Pyung is a good singer.

411
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,230
Dad, let's check on the banner
before we head to the villa.

412
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,000
All right. Let's go check it out.

413
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:24,270
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

414
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,710
Lawyer Kang said he'd be here,
but he's late.

415
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,820
Where is he?

416
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,490
Good afternoon, ma'am.

417
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,020
It's an honor to see you again.

418
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,160
Come in.

419
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,970
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

420
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,140
You brought your family documents, right?

421
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,470
Pardon?

422
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:04,440
I gave them to President Hwang
at the agency yesterday.

423
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,580
You must not have gotten them yet.

424
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,710
So you left them at the agency?

425
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,620
I can call and have them sent over.
Or I could run...

426
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Don't bother.

427
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,750
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
I should've given them to you directly...

428
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,060
I said, don't bother.

429
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,130
So, tell me about your family again.

430
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,330
There's my father and mother,

431
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,970
my older sister who lives in Vietnam
with her husband, a businessman,

432
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,270
and then there is
me and my younger sister.

433
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,940
We're a happy family of four.

434
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,170
- A happy family?
- Yes.

435
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,010
My mom makes amazing side dishes.

436
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,610
So my parents run a side dish shop.

437
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,680
Today is their day off,
so we were supposed to pack gimbap...

438
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,750
and go to our villa as a family.

439
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,080
A villa?

447

To be honest, my mom...

448
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,340
suffered a head injury in an accident.

449
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,250
And today is the anniversary
of that accident.

450
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,450
That's why they want to visit
the villa my dad found a long time ago.

451
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,890
The thing is, my mom used to be brilliant.

452
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
She even passed the bar's first round.

453
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,160
She must've studied for it at the villa.

454
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,700
Where did you say they're going?
Where is this villa?

455
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Sorry?

456
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,030
It's a villa in Taean.

457
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,670
We go there every year...

458
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,370
to try to find out
who was responsible for my mom's injury.

459
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,910
We've been doing it
since I was just a kid,

460
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,980
so it's been decades now.

- Then I'll have to call the police.
