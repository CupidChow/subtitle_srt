1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,720
Found it.

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,830
You're a bad lady. You're a thief.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,740
Oh? It's Jang Mi's hairpin.

4
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,170
You stole Jang Mi's hairpin!

5
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,570
You're a thief!

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,410
No, Suk Hee! You've got it all wrong.

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,620
The hairpin is right here.
See? Right here.

8
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,490
Let's go.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,800
Jang Mi, I'll take care of this.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Go on inside. Your guest is by herself.

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,130
Okay. Thanks.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,540
Dad, what happened?

13
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,170
They must've scurried off like rats.

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,670
I've looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find them.

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,510
A security camera would've been great
right about now.

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,780
You're running a business,
and you didn't even have one installed?

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,820
Who would've thought
something this absurd would happen?

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,450
Even CEO Chae's driver,
Manager Lee, came out.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,250
He seemed really concerned.

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,590
What did Manager Lee say?
Did he say he saw who did it?

21
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,230
Apparently, it happened
while he was in a nearby restroom.

22
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,730
That's too bad.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,730
Suk Hee, you're a really good person,
right?

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,470
So you have to keep
your promise to me, okay?

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,640
I promised.
Suk Hee always keeps her promises.

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,180
That's right.
You're a very good person, Suk Hee.

27
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,850
And good people
always keep their promises.

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,250
- Lips sealed.
- Lips sealed.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,460
I'm so sorry I left you alone
after you came all this way, ma'am.

30
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,230
I'm fine,

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,730
but what was all that commotion outside?

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,130
Someone threw a rock and broke our window.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,630
- Oh, dear.
- It's a huge relief that no one was hurt.

34
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,540
Someone could have been seriously injured
if they'd been hit by that rock.

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,110
Goodness.
Who on earth would do something like that?

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,580
There are some truly awful people
in this world.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,280
Did you catch who did it?

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,950
No. I took photos and filed a report,

39
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,720
but I don't know if they'll catch them
anytime soon.

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,520
You filed a report?

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Yes.

42
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,360
Good. That's the right thing to do.

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,660
You have to report things like that
to the police.

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,630
Good people keep their promises.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,370
This lady is bad! A bad person.

46
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,000
She's a thief.

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,910
- Goodness!
- Mom, how can you be so rude?

48
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,810
This lady is bad!
She stole Jang Mi's hairpin.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,550
She's a thief.

50
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,680
I worked hard to calm her down,
and she just had to blurt it out?

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,080
Mom, what are you talking about?

52
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,820
She has helped us so much.
How can you say that to her?

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

54
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,060
I'm a little taken aback.

55
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,630
But don't worry, I won't take it to heart.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,230
I have a meeting to get to,
so I should be going.

57
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,570
Yes. My mom can be like that sometimes.
Please, try to understand.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,700
She stole the hairpin.

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,680
Good people keep their promises.
You're a bad lady. A bad person.

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,780
Take care.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,810
The thief is getting away.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,920
That lady stole the hairpin.
She's a bad lady. She's a thief.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,230
What a pathetic display. Good grief.

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,300
Was there some trouble inside?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,130
No.

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,340
Manager Lee.

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,940
Your timing was perfect today.

68
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,510
Oh Jang Mi won't even think
about going near Kang Jun Ho now.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,880
We've achieved our initial objective.

70
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,310
Good work, Manager Lee. You're dismissed.

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,090
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,030
Good thing I brought that fake hairpin
with me.

74
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,630
But how on earth did the real one
end up with Jung Suk Hee?

75
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,640
If Ha Neul dropped this
at the villa in Taean,

76
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,840
that would mean Ha Neul was in Taean.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
But why would he have gone
all the way to Taean?

78
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,980
Ha Neul.

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,580
My son...

80
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,690
Where are you?

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,500
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,430
Yes, this is she.

83
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,770
Did you find out where my Ha Neul is?

84
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,680
I'll check because you keep saying
CEO Chae was a thief.

85
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,880
Why would CEO Chae steal a hairpin?
That's ridiculous.

86
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,020
That lady stole the hairpin.
She's a thief.

87
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
What?

88
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,460
See? It's right here.

89
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,560
Why would you say something baseless
and embarrass CEO Chae?

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,330
We owe her so much.

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,040
What? Suk Hee saw it.

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,070
The lady put the hairpin in her pocket.

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,680
That lady is bad. She's a thief.

94
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,780
Stop it, Mom.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,350
That's no way to treat a customer.

96
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,490
Jin Hong Ju.

97
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,290
You want to meet them?

98
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,130
No, thank you.

99
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,300
They're for you to meet, Director Ma.
Why would I?

100
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,340
You were hoping to pick up my leftovers
if I said no, weren't you?

101
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,110
The more I think about Ma Seo Rin,
the more ridiculous she is.

102
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,710
Just because I'm her little gofer
who carries her bag,

103
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,510
she thinks I'm some beggar
who lives off her scraps.

104
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't let Ma Seo Rin get to you.

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,390
She gets her nasty mouth from her mother.
Why are you letting it get to you now?

106
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,260
Of course I'm going to get pissed off
when she insults me. Wouldn't you?

107
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,490
There's no need to get worked up.

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,760
Instead of groveling
for Seo Rin's sloppy seconds,

109
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,100
let's go for an SNE.

110
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
"SNE?"

111
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,100
As in, "Seeking a Natural Encounter?"

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Exactly.

113
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,770
I overheard some of the society wives
talking at the designer shop.

114
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,710
I hear the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals
likes to jog along the Han River.

115
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,350
Oh, really?
The youngest son of Jinan Chemicals?

116
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,750
That's right.

117
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,550
We'll "accidentally" run into him,
all naturally.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,490
If he's the youngest son
of Jinan Chemicals,

119
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,190
he's definitely a son-in-law
the Chairman would covet.

120
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,030
Right? If that happens,
it's a shortcut for us...

121
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,630
- to take over Dream, right?
- You don't even have to ask.

122
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,130
This time, I'll make sure to show
Ma Seo Rin something,

123
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,740
and she won't know what hit her.

124
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,150
Harder. That's it.

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,790
What is this? My hair is completely fried.

126
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,690
Honestly.

127
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,870
The kid was moved around so much
that we barely managed to find him.

128
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,640
You should go and see for yourself.

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,170
Ha Neul,
will I finally get to see you today?

130
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,550
(Protect our children's future,
dreams, and hope)

131
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,390
This is the child I'm looking for.

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,090
I'm his mother.

133
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,960
Please help me find my son, okay?

134
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,800
You're looking for a child who came here
from Tanjin Children's home in Chungnam...

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,530
after passing through
another children's home?

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes.

137
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,770
The first place I left him was
a small children's home,

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,110
but it seems the orphanages were merged,
and the children were scattered.

139
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,310
I also think my son might have been
adopted at some point.

140
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,910
From what I've been able to find out,

141
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,950
it looks like my son
was finally transferred here.

142
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,690
I see.

143
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,790
Please check it against your records here,
and see what you can find.

144
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm not the person in charge here,
so I can't just give you that information.

145
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,130
I'll need approval from our director
when he gets here.

146
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,870
Then when will the director be in?

147
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,770
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Is it good?

149
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,110
All right.

150
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,080
So, did you get the shop window replaced?

151
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,620
Yes. We need to find the jerk
who did it and make him pay.

152
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,150
I'm still shaken up
just thinking about it.

153
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,620
Our Bo Ra was so scared,
she was crying her eyes out.

154
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Mom, I'm okay now.

155
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,630
- I know.
- I'm not a crybaby, am I?

156
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,730
Of course not. You're not a crybaby.
You're too cute for that.

157
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,000
Bo Ra is pretty.

158
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,970
The lady is bad.

159
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,670
That lady is a thief.

160
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,910
What have you been muttering about, Mom?

161
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,010
Jang Mi.

162
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,910
Don't you feel like something strange
is going on lately?

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
What? Like what?

164
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,350
All these strange things
keep happening around you.

165
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,790
I heard you were almost killed
by a falling sign the other day.

166
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,020
And now, a rock flies out of nowhere
and smashes the shop’s window.

167
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,220
It's a miracle no one was hurt.

168
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,230
She's right. That's what I was thinking.

169
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,290
Something feels very wrong.

170
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,210
You can rush through mine,

171
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,110
but please, take extra special care
of my daughter.

172
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
Of course.

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,020
- Mom, stop it.
- What do you mean, stop it?

174
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,050
My daughter...

175
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,650
is marrying the youngest son
of a wealthy family.

176
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,420
Really?

177
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,320
I think I've heard people say...

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,430
"The youngest son of a wealthy family"
before.

179
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,160
Of course you did. They are
the most eligible bachelors around.

180
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,100
Anyway, they're getting married soon.

181
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
So we might end up
buying this whole place,

182
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,440
so put your heart into it, okay?
Really give it your all.

183
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,740
We're your future bosses, after all.

184
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,720
Goodness, future boss.
We'll have to do a great job then.

185
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,550
Does this hurt, future boss?

186
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,520
I'll be more gentle.

187
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,720
That feels so good.

188
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,600
Hong Ju, you're meeting
Jinan Chemicals' youngest son...

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
tomorrow morning, right?

190
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,330
So, you’ll have to
skip dinner tonight, right?

191
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,340
- Yes, don't worry, Mom.
- Good.

192
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,530
What do you think of this place?

193
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,260
It's pretty secluded,
so there are never many people.

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,230
I often come here
to have a drink by myself.

195
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,130
I was already feeling unsettled and down,

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,570
so thank you for bringing me
to such a quiet place.

197
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,920
Whenever I'm going through a hard time,

198
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,330
it feels like you always show up,
Professor Kang.

199
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,430
Just like a savior.

200
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,130
I'm curious about what's going on
with you, Hwa Young,

201
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
but I won't ask.

202
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,140
You can tell me whenever you're ready.

203
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,080
I'll be here to listen anytime.

204
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
Thank you.

205
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,590
Please take the call. I'll be okay.

206
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,400
Hi, honey.

207
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,900
Are you working late again?

208
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,600
- A little bit.
- What about dinner?

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Are you eating out?

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm eating right now.

211
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,440
Okay, don't push yourself too hard.

212
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,010
Lately, you...

213
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,250
seem to have no energy.
You haven't been yourself.

214
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,280
Don't forget to take those herbal pills
every day, all right?

215
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,450
Don't worry. I have to go.

216
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,720
They say male menopause is no joke.

217
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,860
Seeing you so unlike your old self
worries me, too.

218
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,930
Stop worrying about Baek Ho
and worry about yourself for a change.

219
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,700
Would Baek Ho really be seeing some girl
who's bad news?

220
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,070
You must have gotten the wrong idea.

221
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,140
Why are you rambling on about nonsense
over the phone?

222
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,540
Look, I'm busy. I have to go.

223
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,910
Did you take the herbal pills?

224
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,840
I told you I took them!

225
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,690
What is he so busy with right now
to be so cranky?

226
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,890
It's definitely male menopause.

227
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,360
I've never seen a man get it this bad.

228
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Here, eat up.

229
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,500
Really, eat up.
You could stand to gain some weight.

230
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,640
You're way too skinny, Hwa Young.

231
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Here.

232
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,480
- I can eat it myself.
- Come on.

233
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,980
You're putting me in an awkward position
with my arm.

234
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
Here you go.

235
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,610
Someone said they saw you
with a shady woman.

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,310
I was told I should keep my son in line.

237
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,720
I'm so embarrassed.

238
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,020
This is so messed up.

239
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,090
Who would dare frame Jang Mi
with such a ridiculous lie?

240
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,520
They turned Jang Mi into some shady woman.

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,360
I feel so bad for Jang Mi.

242
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,110
Where's the youngest son
of Jinan Chemicals?

243
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
If Jang Mi finds out about this,

244
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,880
how appalled would she be?

245
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,110
Oh my goodness, he's gorgeous.

246
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,330
Please let things go well...

247
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,370
between my daughter
and the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals.

248
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,300
I pray to the skies.

249
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Namu Amitabha Buddha.

250
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,370
Amen.

251
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,680
Are you okay?

252
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,820
Put this on...

253
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,130
for now.

254
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,470
Thank you.

255
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,640
Good grief.

256
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,180
The chain has completely come off.
You won't be able to ride this now.

257
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,020
How did this happen?

258
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,220
It was just the sun.

259
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,320
I was blinded by the bright sun.

260
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,830
The ground gets slippery in the winter,
so please be careful.

261
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,230
Excuse me?

262
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,000
I need to call a taxi to get home,

263
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,570
but my phone died.

264
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,600
I forgot to charge it.

265
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,040
And I also lost my wallet.

266
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
What am I going to do?

267
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,850
I'll call a taxi for you.

268
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,980
One second.

269
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,850
Yes, this is Kang Baek Ho.

270
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,260
Kang Baek Ho?

271
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
He's totally my type.

272
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,960
Isn't the trial at 11 a.m.?

273
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,230
Just have them contact my office.

274
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,830
Just tell them that
Lawyer Kang Baek Ho said so.

275
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,540
Oh my, he's a lawyer.

276
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,900
Lawyer Kang Baek Ho.

277
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,440
Is that right?

278
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,740
I understand.
I'll head in right now and handle it.

279
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,610
Thank you.

280
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,020
I called a taxi for you,
so it should be here in a bit.

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,490
Well then...

282
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,690
Gosh, wait.

283
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,740
Good morning, Father.

284
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,910
Good morning.
Come and sit down for a moment.

285
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,290
I received a report from Team Leader Jin.

286
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,160
It seems there's an issue
regarding the budget cuts...

287
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,760
at Chang Restaurant.

288
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,900
It seems like Team Leader Jin
didn't report all of it to you.

289
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,500
Dream Hotel's occupancy rate
is holding steady at 83 percent,

290
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,880
and absolutely nothing has occurred
that would warrant a report to you.

291
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,710
- I see.
- And Father,

292
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,950
I'm the one in charge...

293
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,750
of Dream Hotel.

294
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,690
So please don't get your updates
from a mere team leader at Dream Group.

295
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,720
Ask me to update you.

296
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,660
You make it sound...

297
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,860
as if I planted Team Leader Jin
in the hotel as my spy.

298
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,130
Whatever happens,

299
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,800
don't get emotional.

300
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,370
That's your problem.

301
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,140
It's also not your place to object...

302
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,810
to how I brought
Mrs. Yeom into this house.

303
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,880
- That's because...
- And there is no reason...

304
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,010
for you to be throwing a fit over...

305
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,180
whether Seo Rin likes that chef or not.

306
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,020
Yes.

307
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,380
I understand.

308
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,330
I know Seo Rin better than you do.

309
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,200
The more you push her,
the more she'll pull away.

310
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,730
You have to be gentle with her.

311
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,200
If you know that,

312
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,600
why are you so on edge,
unlike how you are?

313
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,180
Seo Rin is going on
an arranged date today.

314
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,110
- An arranged date?
- Mrs. Yeom arranged it, so don't worry.

315
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,550
Chairman, it's time for your medicine.

316
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,220
Chairman, your herbal medicine
from the other day is here.

317
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,460
You should drink it while it's warm.

318
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,630
Oh, dear.
I shouldn't be the only one drinking this.

319
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,430
I told you to get some for yourself too,
Mrs. Yeom.

320
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,670
As long as you're healthy,

321
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,840
that's all the strength I need.

322
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,140
- I'll get it.
- All right.

323
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:18,620
I'm playing a round
with Chairman Park today.

324
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,520
Yes, Chairman.
I've already laid out your clothes.

325
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,260
Hong Ju!

326
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,860
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

327
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,460
Weren't you off to meet
Jinan Chemicals' youngest son?

328
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,830
How did you get hurt?

329
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,570
- Seriously, Mom.
- What?

330
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,340
The youngest son of Jinan Chemicals?

331
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,070
Oh my.

332
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,150
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

333
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,150
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

334
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,460
Jinan Chemicals?

335
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,360
What on earth are those two plotting?

336
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,610
- Hello?
- This is the director...

337
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,770
of the Happy Children's home.

338
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,680
You were asking for me?

339
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,220
He has three moles in a row
on the back of his neck.

340
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,820
I also gave you his date of birth.

341
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,450
His name is Ha Neul.

342
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,560
It seems he was moved from place to place
after I first left him.

343
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,260
Please, you have to find my son.

344
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,600
Yes, one of my staff members filled me in.

345
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,200
All right, let's see if we can find him.

346
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,400
Year 1990.

347
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,070
Let's see...

(Child Welfare Card)

349
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,710
Year 1990...

350
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Ha Neul...

351
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,120
Year 1990.

352
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,650
Year 1990...

353
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,990
I think this might be him.

354
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,760
Why don't you take a look?

356
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,130
(Kim Young Ho, Born: May 29, 1990, Male)

357
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,370
(Pinned to the clothes of
the 100-day-old baby was a pearl hairpin.)

358
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,440
(A note with "Ha Neul, May 29, 1990"
was also found.)

359
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,970
That's him. That's my son.

360
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,710
The date of birth is the same,

361
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,740
and everything in this record
matches perfectly.

362
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
Ha Neul.

363
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,910
My son, Ha Neul.

364
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,460
I've finally found you.
I'm so sorry, Ha Neul.

365
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,920
Mommy is so sorry.

366
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,590
So this is him?

367
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,860
That's such a relief.

368
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,830
Thank you.

369
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,470
Thank you so much.

370
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,110
So, where can I go...

371
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,540
to meet my son?

372
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,580
My son.

373
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,620
(Child Welfare Card, Kim Young Ho)

374
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,350
So your name was Kim Young Ho.

00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,020
(Child Welfare Card, Kim Young Ho)

376
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,460
I remember him from long before
his 100th day,

377
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,160
so he looks a little different.

378
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,930
But he also looks like I did as a baby.

379
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,730
My son...

380
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,210
(Diagnosed with Leukemia)

381
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
But...

382
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,980
What is this?

383
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,960
Why does it say "leukemia?"

384
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,430
In the past,

385
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,230
I'd heard that one of the children
had been diagnosed with leukemia.

386
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,300
- How could it be him?
- Then...

387
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,900
are you saying Ha Neul has leukemia?

388
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,340
So? What happened? Where is he now?

389
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,830
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

390
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,400
In the past,

391
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,910
I'd heard that one of the children
had been diagnosed with leukemia...

392
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,910
How could it be him?

393
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,150
Then...

394
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,550
are you saying Ha Neul has leukemia?

395
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,850
So? What happened? Where is he now?

396
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,290
I'm afraid...

397
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,890
it seems he didn't make it.

398
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,090
No. That can't be true.

399
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,300
My son...

400
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,270
would not have passed away that easily,

401
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,970
and so meaninglessly.

402
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,140
Ha Neul.

403
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,110
You were supposed to grow up strong...

404
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,980
so you could have resented the mother
who abandoned you with all your heart.

405
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,120
How could you die at such a young age?

406
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,750
Don't you feel wronged?

407
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Ha Neul.

408
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,830
No.

409
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,930
My son isn't dead.

410
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,570
I'll find him.

411
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,170
I swear I will find Ha Neul.

412
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,170
I'm too sorry...

413
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,780
to let you go like this.

414
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,020
Are you all right, ma'am?

415
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,330
Should I call an ambulance?

416
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
What do you want?

417
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,100
I was about to ask you the same thing.

418
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,340
I don't know what's going on,

419
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,440
but you don't seem to be in any condition
to be reviewing documents.

420
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,610
- I'll come back another time.
- Who are you to question my condition?

421
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,310
- The nerve...
- Stop trying to pick a fight.

422
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,220
What? How dare you!

423
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,150
Is that any way to speak to your CEO?

424
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,890
If you're the CEO, act like one.

425
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,860
Treat your employees with some respect,

426
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,560
instead of picking a fight with me
every time.

427
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,960
Why you...

428
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,130
(The First Man)

429
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,530
I'm Head Chef Kang Jun Ho.

430
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,970
What dish does the chef recommend today?

431
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,870
I hope this makes you jealous, Jun Ho.

432
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,810
I'm not meeting
the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals.

433
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,310
I've met the man of my dreams.

434
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,810
I should probably go apologize
to CEO Chae with my mom, right?

435
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,420
You're not Jang Mi.
You're pretending to be Jang Mi.

436
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,020
What is with this woman?

437
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,390
Who's Jang Mi?
She says I'm pretending to be her.
