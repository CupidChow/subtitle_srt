1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,040
I'll bring the car around.

00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,380
(Episode 18)

3
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,630
Seo Rin.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Wait, you...

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,950
What in the world is she wearing?

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
Ma Seo Rin!

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Wait a second.

8
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,530
Is that not Seo Rin?

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,230
Then who is she?

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,970
Who is she,
and why does she look just like Seo Rin?

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,280
Which baby should I take?

12
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,940
This can't be happening!

13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,870
The twin was alive this whole time?

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,520
No, it must just be a look-alike.

15
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,520
Yes, that's it. Just a look-alike.

16
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,060
There are so many look-alikes
in the world.

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,570
I was told she was definitely dead.

18
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,220
If she's...

19
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,050
Jung Suk Hee's daughter...

20
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,290
The side dish shop?

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,820
No, I have to be sure.

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,230
I have to find out.

23
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,030
No...

24
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,800
No! Wait...

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,170
Taxi!

26
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,840
- CEO Chae.
- Unlock the door. Quick!

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,850
Follow that bicycle, now!

28
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,220
- What's going on?
- I said follow it! Hurry!

29
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,720
Please, let me be wrong.

30
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,160
Don't let her be Suk Hee's daughter.
Please.

32

(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

33
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,600
It can't be.
The twin was alive. She's alive!

34
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,600
How is this possible?

35
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,010
What am I going to do?
What am I supposed to do now?

36
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,480
I got to see
the one and only Chef Kang Jun Ho.

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,850
I really hit the jackpot today!

38
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,150
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

39
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,020
Mom!

40
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,620
Did you just hear that?

41
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,090
She called her "Mom."

42
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,530
She called Jung Suk Hee "Mom!"

43
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
But...

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,700
she definitely died.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,440
What in the world happened?

46
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,040
I finally saw Chef Kang Jun Ho!

47
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,840
What?

48
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,180
Where did everyone go?
Why is the shop empty?

49
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,520
Welcome.

50
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,300
Come again. Thank you.

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,460
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

52
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,070
Gosh...

53
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,230
What do you mean, "what happened?"

54
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,340
That girl is standing right there,
alive and well.

55
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm telling you,
Jung Suk Hee's child is alive.

56
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,510
You told me that child was dead!

57
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,950
So how is Jung Suk Hee's twin still alive?

58
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,690
Answer me. I'm asking you what happened.
Lee Kang Hyuk!

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,550
How did you deal with
what I told you to do?

60
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,790
Say something! I said, say something!

61
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,590
Tell me what you're going to do now!

62
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,970
Bo Ra has gotten so big, hasn't she?

63
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,970
Oh my, our Bo Ra's become a little lady.

64
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,410
Bo Ra's not a young lady. She's a kid.

65
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,950
Mom, you haven't changed a bit.

66
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,450
Bo Ra, you remember your uncle, right?

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,490
- We video-chatted before.
- Yes, I remember.

68
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,190
- She loves his songs. Right, sweetie?
- Yes.

69
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,930
What about you? Did you two come alone?
Your husband isn't with you?

70
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,530
This jelly is yummy.

71
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,600
Here, Bo Ra. Have some.

72
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,440
Thank you.

73
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,910
Bo Ra, go eat jelly with Grandma
in the room, okay?

74
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,910
- Let's go, Grandma.
- Okay.

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,610
- What a pretty girl.
- Let's go.

76
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,950
You have some too, Grandma.

77
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,030
You're such a good girl, Bo Ra.
You're so pretty, Bo Ra.

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,460
You're nice too, Grandma.
You're pretty too.

79
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,700
Tae Sook, you weren't kicked out
by your husband, were you?

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,440
Hey! Don't say things like that.
It's bad luck.

81
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,980
Gosh! Dad, you said I'm a singer now.
Are you still going to hit me?

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,410
- You little brat...
- Why is no one in the shop?

83
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,810
Tae Sook!

84
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,250
- Jang Mi.
- Hey! When did you get here?

85
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,950
You're too pretty to be wasting away
in a place like this.

86
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,320
Dad, we've got to marry her off.

87
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,960
Gosh, why the marriage talk already?
It's not like I can do it alone.

88
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,660
It's about time our Jang Mi got married.

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,970
So, what brings you here?
Did you come with your husband?

90
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,670
No, I just popped in with Bo Ra.

91
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,370
I wanted to show Bo Ra
that she has family here.

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,870
Bo Ra's here too? Where is she?

93
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,080
Bo Ra!

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,780
There's my Bo Ra!

95
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,120
You're even prettier in person
than on our video calls.

96
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,820
- Auntie.
- Oh my.

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,490
You’re too soft.

98
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,990
Tae Sook stole your tuition money
to get married,

99
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,460
and you're this happy to see her.

100
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,770
Hey, you're not still holding a grudge
about me stealing your money, are you?

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,440
Not when it gave me
such an adorable niece.

102
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,850
Did you find anything out?

103
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,850
I'm asking you what happened!

104
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,060
It looks like...

105
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,890
Jung Suk Hee hid
one of the twins at the villa.

106
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,160
What do you mean, "it looks like?"

107
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,660
And you're only finding this out now?

108
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,670
How does that make any sense?

109
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,070
My baby.

110
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Live.

111
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
We...

112
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,350
have to survive and see each other again.

113
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,300
You're here, boss.

114
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,370
You're here, boss.

115
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,980
So you're saying Jung Suk Hee
hid one twin at the villa,

116
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,150
held the other one in front of you,

117
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,390
and she just pretended
to jump into the river? Is that it?

118
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,150
She fooled me.

119
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,320
Open up!

120
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,430
Open up!

121
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,170
Darn it!

122
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,380
- Darn it!
- What are you doing? Go after her!

123
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,230
My baby.

124
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,030
Mommy's so sorry.

125
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,600
Why don't you just give up, Jung Suk Hee?

126
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,950
So what are you going to do now?

127
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,950
Jung Suk Hee, who we thought was dead,
is alive.

128
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,160
Her twin, a lookalike of Seo Rin,
is alive.

129
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,130
So what are you going to do now?

130
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
Hwa Young, I'm sorry.

131
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,660
I'm so sorry, Hwa Young.

132
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,930
Shut up.

133
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,370
You think "sorry"
is going to fix any of this?

134
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,810
Here you go.

135
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,750
So you know, I'm only putting up with this
because I'm in a good mood today.

136
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,980
Putting up with what?

137
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,050
With you constantly ordering from here
and making me run all over the place.

138
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,990
Should I just stop ordering from you then?

139
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,860
You think I can't see what you're doing?

140
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,860
You're just ordering this on purpose
to see me.

141
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,900
That's not true.

142
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,900
Anyway, you haven't eaten dinner yet,
have you, Jang Mi?

143
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,570
Everyone else has gone home,
so let's just eat together.

144
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,770
If you're asking,
you think I'm going to say no?

145
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,010
So is that why you ordered two?

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,610
Yes. One for me and one for you.

147
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,920
- Gosh, don't go to this trouble again.
- Okay.

148
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,520
So, what's got you in such a good mood?

149
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,390
My sister Tae Sook and my niece
just came from Vietnam today.

150
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,300
And I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

151
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,900
Chef Kang Jun Ho?

152
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,370
Yes.

153
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,600
Even the way he walked was so cool.

154
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,570
He was just like a model.

155
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,380
Wait, you mean Chef Kang Jun Ho
from Chang Restaurant...

156
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,580
is the guy you have a crush on?

157
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,850
Yes.

158
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,150
So don't even think about hitting on me.

159
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,090
Because I'm not
the least bit interested in you.

160
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,200
Of all people, she has to be hanging
around this hotel.

161
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,030
If Father or Seo Rin were to see her...

162
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,040
It would be a nightmare.

163
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,340
It's a matter of time before they learn
I stole a baby 30 years ago.

164
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Calm down. I'll handle it.

165
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,980
The loose ends from 30 years ago.

166
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,850
- I'll take care of it for good.
- And how are you going to do that?

167
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,920
You failed 30 years ago.

168
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,160
Why do you think you can handle it now?

169
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,020
I absolutely will not fail this time.

170
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,840
Mrs. Yeom,
you don't have to prepare a thing.

171
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,680
But still, Chairman.
I should at least prepare our bedding.

172
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,120
The bedding for us to share.

173
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,950
I know what you're thinking,

174
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,820
but I can't sleep with someone next to me.

175
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,090
What?
You mean we'll sleep in separate rooms?

176
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,860
No, we'll put another bed in the room,
so don't worry about it.

177
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,070
You and Hong Ju just need
to bring your clothes.

178
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,370
Don't you worry about a thing.

179
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,670
Okay.

180
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,400
But...

181
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,680
if CEO Chae finds out I'm moving in here,

182
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,610
she'll want to kill me.

183
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,450
- I don't think I'll make it out alive.
- Don't worry.

184
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,880
You're moving in with me,
not my daughter-in-law.

185
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,950
What are you so afraid of?

186
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,890
I'm here for you, so don't you worry.

187
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,130
Thank you, Chairman.

188
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,400
To think of all the years
I spent here with you in tears.

189
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,170
And all I have to take with me...

190
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,610
is just this one single bag.

191
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,580
Well, Yeom San Wol
you've suffered long enough.

192
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,680
Hey, wait.

193
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,920
What are you doing with that?

194
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,060
Mom.

195
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,060
We're different from the flashy CEO Chae
and arrogant Director Ma.

196
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,430
- I mean, we have to be.
- What?

197
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Not this one.

198
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,500
Like this, we have to look
simple and frugal, you know.

199
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,910
"We couldn't care less
about your money, Chairman."

200
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
"We're not greedy for it at all."

201
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,750
- That's the vibe we need to give off.
- But...

202
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,220
do you know how much I had to plead
with him just to get this one bag?

203
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,950
This is fair payment for my labor.
My wages!

204
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,650
I'm not saying we do this forever.

205
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,230
Ma Seo Rin couldn't run a company
if her life depended on it.

206
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,930
If I weren't there to clean up her messes,

207
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,200
she couldn't even find
the approval documents.

208
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,900
How can he entrust the group
to a girl like that?

209
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,840
How could he possibly let her inherit it?

210
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,710
Hong Ju, you really don't know
Chairman Ma at all.

211
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,610
- That geezer is obsessed with bloodlines.
- You're wrong.

212
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,010
Even with Ma Seo Rin
so fiercely against it,

213
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,020
we're moving into that house.

214
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,750
For an old man drowning in loneliness,

215
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,250
what good is a bloodline?

216
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,130
You've really got it all figured out.

217
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,360
Mom. Our next objective...

218
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,000
is for you to legally marry the Chairman.
All right?

219
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,770
That's the only way
I can legitimately inherit the company.

220
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,370
You're right.
That's the least I can do for you.

221
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,740
Once you take over Dream Group,
it's like you'll have conquered the world.

222
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,080
We're no longer the maids
who waited on that mother-daughter pair.

223
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,390
So you have to make sure
I get to call him "Dad."

224
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,060
Got it?

225
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,530
Right. The humiliation we suffered,
carrying their bags, being patronized.

226
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,530
We will make them pay.

Hwa Young, are you busy?

236
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,660
I just called to hear your voice.

237
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,290
Don't work too late.
Get some sleep. Good night.

You scared me!

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
What are you so jumpy about?
You're acting strange.

What's so strange?

241
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
Honestly.

242
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,110
Why are you always taking your phone
to the bathroom?

243
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,380
You're glued to your phone these days.

244

And you're the one
who was always losing it.

245

Tell me. What's gotten into you?

246
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,560
What are you talking about?

247
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,230
There's a lot of fun stuff on YouTube,
you know.

248
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,300
That's true. People leave YouTube on
when they go to sleep these days.

249
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,470
They say it helps them sleep better.

250

Right, you know, those deep sleep videos
or whatever they're called.

251
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Goodness.

252
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Seriously...

253
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,570
You look like you didn't get any sleep
last night either.

254
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,440
What about the Chairman? Did he leave?

255
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,550
Yes. He didn't say where he was going.

256
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,380
He just said that he had to step out
for something.

257

Secretary Kim, it's me.

258
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,460
Where's the Chairman?

259
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,900
What? You can't tell me?

260
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,170
Did the Chairman order you
not to tell me anything?

261
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,980
He went to Yeom San Wol's place,
didn't he?

262
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,010
It's not like he can hide it from me,

263
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,910
and you of all people
should know that, Secretary Kim.

264
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,920
Listen up.

265
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,620
You'd better choose your side wisely.

266

So he thinks he can just openly visit
Yeom San Wol's house?

but I found the mackerel you like.

What a relief.

You always say you hate fishy mackerel,
but look at you, caring for your sister.

277
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,030
Jang Mi is so soft-hearted
that whenever she sees the fish's eyes,

278
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,230
she always covers them with a leaf,
saying she feels bad for them.

279
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,130
Your attitude toward cooking is all wrong.

280
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,440
You need to see them as ingredients.
You shouldn't feel sorry for them.

it had to be my brother.

- What's with you?

So you're the generous CEO
he's been talking about.

346
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,230
Oh my, I'm so sorry
I didn't recognize you.

347
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,500
So you're CEO Chae Hwa Young.

348
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,470
Thank you so much.

349
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,470
I came by your office
to give you lunch boxes...

350
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,710
as a thank-you for helping my brother.

351
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Lunch boxes?

352
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,350
And you even come all the way
to our humble shop so often.

353
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,550
Not at all. Your side dishes here
are really delicious.

354
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,860
- I find myself craving them sometimes.
- Well, thank you for everything.

355
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,530
I'm in a hurry, so I should get going.

356
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,200
I'll come by your office
to thank you properly, CEO Chae.

357
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,570
She's so classy and beautiful.

358
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,770
I always thought she seemed too glamorous
to be shopping here.

359
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,010
She really stood out.

360
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,580
I saw her there on your performance day
and wondered why,

361
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,410
and it turns out
she was the CEO sponsoring you all along.

362
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,180
- Oh my, she forgot her food.
- Hey, hurry and bring it to her.

363
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,420
- Oh no.
- Hurry up.

364
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,890
- What do you want me to do?
- Just drive.

365
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,930
Ma'am, you forgot this.

366
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,180
That's strange.

367
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,980
What is it, Dad?

368
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,980
About the banner.

369
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,750
If I remember correctly,
she also filed a complaint...

370
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,420
to have a banner taken down.

371
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,020
What? CEO Chae Hwa Young did?

372
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,310
(The First Man)

373
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,310
- Do you really like Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- How is that your business, Lawyer Kang?

374
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,980
Stop right now. He's a workaholic
who's always incredibly busy.

375
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,350
What is the meaning of this, Father?
In my house, of all places,

376
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,460
you're letting Yeom San Wol
and her daughter move in?

377
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,090
This isn't your house. It's my house.

378
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,230
After everything I've been through
to get here...

379
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,400
You think I'm going to bat an eye?

380
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,700
I should go to the hotel
to introduce myself.

381
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,170
Oh Jang Mi?

382
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,570
I can't let this happen.

383
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,570
If the Chairman or Seo Rin sees her...

384
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,570
