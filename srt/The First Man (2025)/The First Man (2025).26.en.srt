(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,240
(Episode 26)

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,910
So, did you find anything out?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,220
I asked if my Ha Neul was ever in Taean.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,050
An item that belonged to Ha Neul
was discovered at the villa in Taean.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,460
This proves Ha Neul was in Taean,
doesn't it?

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,190
You have to find out
where Ha Neul has been.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,470
I went light on the cinnamon...

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,340
and added more orange peel
to this mulled wine.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,670
It smells amazing.
Grandpa, what do you think?

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,980
It smells wonderful.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,650
This is a rare treat
you can't get anywhere else.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,250
Go on, Grandfather. Have a taste.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,750
- Okay.
- You're right. I'm honored to taste this.

15
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,260
We're thrilled to be drinking mulled wine
made by a three-Michelin-star chef,

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,530
but, Chef Kang, you came here as a guest,
yet you made us drinks.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,460
We feel so bad putting you to work.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,100
Don't you agree, Chairman?

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:04,570
- Was the food not to your liking?
- Not at all. It was delicious.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,710
I made the mulled wine because
it's good for lowering blood pressure.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,180
You even knew my grandfather
had high blood pressure?

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,480
You're amazing.

23
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,880
He's a fine young man,
a rare find these days.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,220
He's a three-Michelin-star chef, Mom.

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,350
Exactly. He'd be a great catch anywhere.

26
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,460
This is delicious.
Jun Ho, pour me another glass.

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,100
Thank you.

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,100
Grandpa, now that you see Jun Ho up close,
what do you think? Isn't he handsome?

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,510
Isn't he the perfect match for me?

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,410
Good grief. "A perfect match?"

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,850
Aren't you jumping the gun?
Honestly, this kid.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,010
I don't care. If it's not Jun Ho,
I'm not getting married.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,320
Chairman, there's something
I'd like to say.

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,320
- I...
- You.

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,160
Come and speak with me.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,510
All right. Tell me what's on your mind.

37
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,910
What are your thoughts on my Seo Rin?

38
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,250
I have no interest
in Director Ma Seo Rin whatsoever.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,690
Marriage is out of the question,
so please don't worry, Chairman.

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,220
No matter what,

41
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,520
- I will never marry Director Ma.
- Oh my!

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,690
Mom, come here!

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,630
Do you truly mean that?

44
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,140
It takes two to tango, as they say.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,770
Then are you saying my Seo Rin's feelings
are one-sided?

46
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,310
Yes. Because I'm aware
of Director Ma's feelings,

47
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,810
that I wanted to make my position clear.

48
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,820
In fact, the reason I accepted
your dinner invitation today...

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,650
was to tell you this in person.

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,730
Did you think I would object to you
as a match for my Seo Rin,

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,060
so you decided to beat me to the punch?

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,470
Didn't you anticipate this
to some degree, Chairman?

53
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,400
That's why you were afraid
Director Ma would get hurt,

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,740
and you deliberately brought me here.

55
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,010
Don't you ever go back on your word.

56
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,850
Now, let's enjoy the mulled wine
with that out of the way.

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,070
A beautiful flower is meant to be picked.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,300
Just you watch, Jun Ho.
I'll be the one to put you in my vase.

59
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,710
What a character.
Now that's some fighting spirit.

60
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,380
You're home, CEO Chae.

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,420
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
the man Seo Rin is crazy about, is here.

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,790
- You're late.
- Yes, I'm back.

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,230
Mom, try this mulled wine
made by my darling,

64
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,460
Chef Kang Jun Ho. It's to die for.

65
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,800
Team Leader Jin,
did you invite Chef Kang Jun Ho?

66
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,200
- Yes.
- Why would you bring an employee home?

67
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,810
Mom, you're making Chef Kang Jun Ho
uncomfortable.

68
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,010
It's rude to say that
right in front of him.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,850
Since when did you care
about being polite?

70
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Team Leader Jin, I need to see you later.

71
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,820
Now that wench is trying
to go after my daughter, too.

72
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,260
Just try and lay a hand on my daughter.
I won't just stand by and watch.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,190
Come and sit down.

74
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,990
Mrs. Yeom's arm is about to fall off.

75
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,230
Here.

76
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll go get some more appetizers.

77
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,320
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,130
You missed your interview? Why?

79
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,760
I told you, something came up.
Why are you being so nosy?

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,700
But you said it was your dream
to train under Chef Kang Jun Ho.

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,800
What reason could someone like that
have to miss the interview?

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,840
I really went out on a limb
to introduce you to my brother.

83
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,840
Why are you so worked up about it?

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,580
You're making it sound like
you're the one who got me the interview.

85
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,880
No, what I mean is,

86
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm just asking why you missed out
on something you wanted so badly!

87
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,590
- You're being so loud.
- I'm not being loud at all.

88
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,930
Anyway, I couldn't make it this time,
but I'll try again soon.

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,830
Definitely. For sure!

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,800
I doubt you'll get
such an easy chance again.

91
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,670
What?

92
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,650
CEO Chae!

93
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,560
Come try some of the mulled wine
Chef Kang made.

94
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,560
It smells amazing.

95
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,100
Alright, since we're all here,
let's have a toast.

96
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,800
Sounds good, Grandpa.

97
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,140
We should do this more often.

98
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,510
- Alright, everyone. Cheers.
- Cheers.

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,380
Cheers.

100
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,850
Cheers.

101
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Oh my!

102
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,020
Oh my!

103
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,090
Oh my goodness.

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
- Oh no!
- Oh my!

105
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,860
You should've been more careful,
Yeom San Wol.

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,460
- How could you be so rude to our guest?
- CEO Chae, you...

107
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,230
Mrs. Yeom! What do you think you're doing?

108
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,330
Oh no, Jun Ho. That wine stain
will never come out with just water.

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,970
This is so frustrating. You should go
get cleaned up. Go on upstairs, okay?

110
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,740
- Go on.
- No, it's just...

111
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,210
I have no idea...

112
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,360
Find my Ha Neul, and hurry!

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,460
I told you, right? He has three moles
in a row on the back of his neck.

114
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,670
- Don't forget.
- Come on, ma'am. Stop rushing me.

115
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,970
Hey, we need time to look into it,
you know!

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,810
All we have to go on is that villa
in Taean from decades ago.

117
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,980
- How can we find anything with just that?
- I gave you this job ages ago.

118
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,920
And in all this time, all you've found
is that his orphanage is gone.

119
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,380
You're so impatient.

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,290
Seriously, if you're this desperate,
how did you wait this long?

121
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,260
Anyway, we're on it,
so just be patient. And stop rushing me.

122
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,760
Hello?

123
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,360
The nerve!

124
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,440
Jun Ho, I don't think
that stain will come out of your shirt.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,710
So why don't you stay the night?

126
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,040
What did she say?

127
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,110
Seriously...

128
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,780
You really are handsome.
I've got a good eye.

129
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,650
Ma Seo Rin, stop messing around.

130
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,460
What's this about him staying the night?

131
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,760
You must be uncomfortable
with your clothes all ruined.

132
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,330
I'm fine, really.

133
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,470
Jun Ho. I'm not sure if it'll fit,
but what about this?

134
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
It's way too small.

135
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,640
- Team Leader Jin.
- Yes?

136
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,810
You know the shop that fitted the
Chairman's tux for the last party, right?

137
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,710
Go there and get a few dress shirts.

138
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,750
Right now? This late at night?

139
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,650
Why? Do you have a problem with that?

140
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,880
You're the one who invited him.

141
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,550
Besides, Chef Kang is in this mess
because of your mother,

142
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,360
so what's with that look on your face?

143
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,130
Are you saying you don't want to go?

144
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,800
A white Oxford shirt, size 16.5 neck,
should fit him, don't you think?

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,670
That's really not necessary.
I'm just going straight home.

146
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,540
And what are you going to wear?

147
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,940
That wet shirt? Or are you planning
to go in that bathrobe?

148
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,410
That would be a sight to see.

149
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
What are you standing around for?

150
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,580
I'll call the shop, so get going now.

151
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,450
Yes.

152
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Hurry back.

153
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh my. Jun Ho.

154
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,530
Is that a tattoo?

155
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,670
A tattoo?

156
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,640
On the back of your neck, it looks like
some kind of number.

157
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,040
What do they mean?

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,400
You don't need to know.

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,010
- Hong Ju! Where are you going?
- Don't even ask.

160
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,020
- I have to get a shirt from the tux shop.
- At this hour?

161
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,250
It was an order from CEO Chae.
She's really out to get us, isn't she?

162
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,020
Seriously. That Chae Hwa Young...

163
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,760
I can't believe this.

164
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Chairman.

165
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,670
At this rate,
if I have to live here any longer,

166
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,370
this stress is going to kill me.

167
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,370
You saw what CEO Chae did earlier,
didn't you?

168
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,710
She told our Hong Ju
she'd deal with her later.

169
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,310
Just because she invited Chef Kang...

170
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,050
she's taking it out on both of us.
Can you believe it?

171
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,390
And I spilled the wine...

172
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,350
because CEO Chae
bumped into me on purpose!

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,130
- Don't get upset over every little thing.
- Chairman!

174
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,560
Because of me,

175
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,830
Hong Ju had to run out in the middle
of the night to buy a dress shirt!

176
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,570
I don't know how long we can live
like this walking on eggshells.

177
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,070
It's just so upsetting.

178
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,490
What about Jun Ho? Is he still not back?

179
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,890
No, he's not answering his phone.
Where could he be?

180
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,290
- He was invited to Chairman Ma's, right?
- Why all of a sudden?

181
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,990
You don't think he's dating someone,
do you?

182
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,330
Him? Dating? As if.

183
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Don't you remember...

184
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,230
all those girls
who were head over heels for him?

185
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,070
He shut them all down cold,
saying it wasn't time,

186
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,710
and he left for the US to study.

187
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,440
I have no idea what goes on in his head.

188
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,710
He's never even dated.

189
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,310
That's just because
he hasn't met the right person yet.

190
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
What about you?

191
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,920
And I suppose you have?

192
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,890
Jun Ho seems to think
you're dating someone.

193
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,420
So, are you seeing someone?

194
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,390
What am I thinking?

195
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,360
Oh my, look at you.

196
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,160
You really are seeing someone!

197
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,260
What? No. Where would I find a girlfriend?

198
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm just on a hamster wheel
between the office and the courthouse.

199
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,070
Come on, Mom.
You know my schedule better than anyone.

200
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,670
That's true.

201
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,370
Still, what do women see
in a guy as cold-hearted as him,

202
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
that makes him so popular
wherever he goes?

203
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,510
Seriously, what's his secret?

204
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,180
You just don't see it.
Jun Ho acts tough, but he's a big softie.

205
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,280
He might seem cold on the outside,
but he's so warm on the inside.

206
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,920
He calls me all the time,

207
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,120
and he sends me texts and gifts.
You didn't know that, did you?

208
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,060
Mom, are you taking his side now?

209
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,260
You know, when I think about it,
you totally play favorites.

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,170
Hey! I'm the one who takes better care
of you, aren't I?

211
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,270
Okay. Of course,
you're a good son too, Baek Ho.

212
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,510
- Stop it! That's so cheesy! Seriously.
- Come here, son.

213
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,670
- Oh, you little rascal!
- Mom!

214
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,310
Stop it.

215
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,550
Hey now, what's all this?

216
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,150
Hey, you have a cold.
Why aren't you bundled up?

217
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,750
- Thanks, honey.
- Oh, honestly.

218
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,620
By the way,

219
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,390
what was all the excitement about?

220
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,760
We were asking if he has a girlfriend.

221
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,460
Our boys are just like you.
They're hopeless when it comes to dating.

222
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,730
Who knows when they'll ever get married?

223
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,300
All our friends' kids are getting married
and having babies.

224
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,370
Hey, why are you blaming me
for Baek Ho's love life?

225
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,740
Dad, Mom was your first love, right?
And I'm sure she'll be your last, too.

226
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,180
That's right. Your father's only ever
had eyes for me.

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,220
And since you guys take after him
neither of you can date properly.

228
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,750
I'll start dating, I promise.

229
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,120
If you date, you'll be like your father.

230
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,260
You'll be loyal
to a fault to just one woman.

231
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
You.

232
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,780
What was your motive
for inviting Chef Kang?

233
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,450
I had no ulterior motive.

234
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,010
Are you hoping Seo Rin
will marry Chef Kang?

235
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,390
- So what's in it for you?
- I never wanted that.

236
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,890
Stop playing innocent.
We both know the game.

237
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,520
Just be straight with me, okay?

238
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,930
Fine, let's say
Seo Rin asked you to do it.

239
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,900
You wouldn't have pulled a stunt like this
unless you stood to gain something.

240
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,870
Seo Rin likes Chef Kang.
My only crime was indulging her.

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,140
If you're going to grill someone,
grill Seo Rin. I don't deserve this.

242
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,040
I even bought him a shirt at this hour.
Do you really have to do this again?

243
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,740
Shut up! Don't you dare play
the victim with me.

244
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,780
You think I can't see your hidden agenda?

245
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
You're after Dream.

246
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,650
Aren't you?

247
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,250
I am not.

248
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
I would never dare...

249
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,190
You and your mother desperately
clawed your way into this house...

250
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,760
is for one reason only.

251
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,530
It's Dream Group.

252
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,300
It's pathetic how desperately
you're trying to take it over.

253
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,800
So you cooked up this absurd scheme
to invite Chef Kang over...

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,010
and try to somehow set him up
with Seo Rin.

255
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,610
But that's never going to happen
on my watch.

256
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,550
This is a warning.
Don't try anything foolish.

257
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,010
Mark my words.

258
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,760
I went easy on you today.
I'll be watching...

259
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,930
what other tricks
you and your mother have up your sleeves.

260
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,400
CEO Chae, you've gone too far.

261
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,370
What did Hong Ju do wrong?
Why are you tormenting her like this?

262
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,270
You're sucking the life out of her!

263
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,470
You've got a lot of nerve.

264
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,610
- What makes you so bold?
- Go on, kill me! Do it!

265
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,920
That's right. I'm being bold.
Let's settle this right now.

266
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,890
There's only so much a person can take!
What did my Hong Ju do wrong?

267
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,330
Is it such a crime to invite over the man
your own daughter is crazy about?

268
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,530
Are you trying to win this by yelling?

269
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,360
How uncivilized. Who do you think you are
to raise your voice?

270
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,140
Listen carefully, Yeom San Wol.
The more you carry on like this,

271
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,670
the harder you'll make it
for your daughter, you birdbrain.

272
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,240
Mom.

273
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,610
Please, stop.

274
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,810
What's your problem?
You want a piece of me?

275
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Get out.

276
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,690
Don't you dare dirty my room, you vermin.
Get out now!

277
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,320
Mom.

278
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,360
You just try tormenting my daughter again.

279
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,830
If you do, I'll have nothing left to lose,
and I won't hold back.

280
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,600
Let's go already!

281
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,670
Such vulgar people.

282
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,370
So trashy.

283
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,980
Hey, check this out.
Baek Ho made a video of me singing...

284
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,250
- and he's going to post it on YouTube.
- Really?

285
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,780
Wait, the person singing
next to you is me!

286
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,350
How am I in this?

287
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,520
You're right. When did you
ever sing harmony with him?

288
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,460
He said he made it using AI.

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,990
I gave Baek Ho one photo of Jang Mi,
and he put this together.

290
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,200
What?

291
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,230
Seriously, Baek Ho is so talented.

292
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,130
Back in school, he'd always be messing
around with me,

293
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,470
but he'd still ace every test.
What a jerk.

294
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,610
Seriously, what can't he do?
He's good at literally everything.

295
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,040
That's right.
His parents must be so proud of him.

296
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,610
He's handsome, kind, and a great student.
Plus, he's just a genuinely good person.

297
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,580
Dad, what about me?

298
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,490
You can't be jealous of Baek Ho's parents
when you have me right here.

299
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,620
You're...

300
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,630
- You're my treasure, you rascal. My gosh.
- Me too, Dad.

301
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,930
You're my treasure too.

302
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,230
- Oh, my.
- He's my dad.

303
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
- Come on.
- Come here, everyone.

304
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,480
No matter what it takes,
I have to find my son.

305
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,540
I don't know how much longer
that old geezer will live,

306
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,950
but Dream belongs to my son.

307
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,920
My son. My own flesh and blood.

308
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,990
Yes. That's exactly how it should be.

309

(Cheongsin Angel House)

310
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Ha Neul, I'm so sorry.

311
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,040
Mommy is so sorry.

312
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,940
When you're older and we meet again,

313
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,140
you can resent me all you want.

314
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,180
So for now...

315
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,250
Eat well,

316
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,980
sleep well,

317
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,990
grow up big,

318
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,290
strong and healthy.

319
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,330
My baby, I'm so sorry.

(Cheongsin Angel House)

321
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,950
(Consistent care matters
more than kind words.)

(Please be sure to write down
the child's date of birth.)

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,760
I'm sorry, Ha Neul.

326

Ha Neul, I'm so sorry.

327
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,420
Jun Ho.

328
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,290
When did you get in last night?
I waited for you.

329
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,460
Listen.

330
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,520
You need to be more selective
about the people you see.

331
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,060
What? Did you just come from
sharpening your knives?

332
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,460
Why are you so on edge?

333
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,770
Please, stop getting involved
with just anyone and everyone you meet.

334
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,700
- And stop helping everyone who asks.
- Jun Ho.

335
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,110
I'm sure Jang Mi had a good reason
for not making the interview.

336
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,170
A reason?

337
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,240
It looks like you don't even know
what that reason is.

338
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,410
I mean, why are you even getting involved?

339
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,810
It's because you're such a pushover...

340
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,380
that people think they can
walk all over you and ask for anything.

341
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,290
Whether I meddle in others' business
or act like a pushover,

342
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,820
that's none of your business.

343
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,720
Then you shouldn't have asked for a favor
in the first place.

344
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,100
Go and tell that Jang Mi,
or whatever her name is,

345
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,330
not to show her face in front of me again.

346
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,570
How can she dream of being a chef
when she's that unreliable?

347
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,140
With an attitude like that,

348
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,010
I'll make sure she can't set foot
in this industry.

349
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,610
Go and tell her that. Word for word.

350
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,450
He's ready to kill her
just for missing one interview.

351
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,490
Anyway, if Jang Mi finds out about this,

352
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,590
she'll be crushed.

353
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,330
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Chef Kang,
did you make it home okay yesterday?

355
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,270
Yes.

356
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,610
But why does a chef like you have tattoos?

357
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,380
That is not your concern.

358
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,150
I was just wondering
if there was a particular reason.

359
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,120
Do I need to explain my reasons to you?

360
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,900
Let me make this clear, Chef Kang,
just in case you get any funny ideas.

361
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,770
Don't even dream of getting together
with my Seo Rin.

362
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,140
I believe I said it's one-sided
on Director Ma's part.

363
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,540
But if you keep pushing me like this,

364
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,610
it's just going to make me defiant.

365
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,520
- Defiant?
- Yes. You never know what might happen.

366
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
What's that supposed to mean?

367
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you saying you might actually try
to get with my Seo Rin?

368
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,390
Since you keep pushing it,
as if my answer wasn't clear enough,

369
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm saying that I could very well have
a change of heart.

370
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,970
Kang Jun Ho.

371
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,670
I've given you a clear warning.

372
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,910
You will never marry Seo Rin.

373
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,290
The nerve of him.

374
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,460
I gave him so many hints.
He should have quit on his own.

375
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,690
Why is he so persistent?

376
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,970
Oh Jang Mi, what's the occasion?

377
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,610
Ma'am.

378
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,640
Did you by any chance tell
Chef Kang Jun Ho...

379
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,650
why I had to miss my interview?

380
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,220
Of course.

381
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,550
- I told him already.
- You did?

382
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,090
Thank you so much.

383
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm on my way to my interview
with Chef Kang Jun Ho now.

384
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,190
Right now?

385
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,700
I see.

386
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,230
Okay, then leave your house at 2 p.m.
That should work.

387
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,270
The restaurant should be slow
around that time.

388
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,670
At 2 p.m.? Okay, got it.

389
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,670
I'll leave home at 2 p.m., then.
Thank you.

390
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,880
Manager Lee, come in.

391
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,520
You wanted to see me?

392
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,630
So, what's the plan?
Am I going to have to clutch my stomach...

393
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,130
and put on a show again?

394
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,430
I'll take care of it properly.

395
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,200
I don't want to have to say this again,
so you handle it for good this time.

396
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,970
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,670
I'll take care of it
this time without fail.

398
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,770
Just make Oh Jang Mi disappear
from my sight, please.

399
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,020
My Jang Mi is so pretty. You're pretty.

400
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,690
Jang Mi is Suk Hee's daughter.

401
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,630
You're pretty too, Mom. My lovely mom.

402
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,190
Mom.

403
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,360
I promise I'll do a great job today.

404
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,980
Hi, I'm here.
Jang Mi, where are you off to?

405
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm going for an interview
with Chef Kang Jun Ho.

406
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,780
- Dad, I'm heading out!
- Okay, good luck with the interview.

407
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,520
- I will!
- Go on.

408
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,750
She's going for an interview?

409
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,980
Line it up well from the angle below.

410
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,220
Don't mess this up.

411
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,450
Got it.

412
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Fifty meters.

413
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,200
Aim carefully.

414
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,770
Precisely.

415
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,880
Ten.

416
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
Nine.

417
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Eight.

418
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
Seven.

419
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Six.

420
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,390
Five.

421
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,090
Four.

422
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,990
Three.

423
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Two.

424
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,190
One.

425
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,730
Now!

426
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,340
(PC Station)

427
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,410

428

(The First Man)

429
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,130
About your son...

430
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,130
When did you meet my Baek Ho?

431
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,370
It seems he's seeing a woman
who's bad news.

432
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,570
- Isn't that the girl, Oh Jang Mi?
- You know her too?

433
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,270
Who dares to talk about Jang Mi like that?
Bring them to me right now.

434
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,110
I must find out about that hairpin, too.

435
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,050
Where did she put my mother's keepsake?

436
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,880
That's mine.
