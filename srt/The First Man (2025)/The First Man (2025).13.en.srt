1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,740
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have kept you
talking about all that.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,080
Please come again.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,240
Come again!

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,310
Okay.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,720
Hello.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,750
What do you mean the banner's gone?

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,760
You think someone reported it
and had it removed?

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,710
Right.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,050
Right.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,660
You don't think it was those jerks
who did this to Suk Hee, do you?

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,330
You can see yourself out. The door's open.

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,300
It's got to be them.

13
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,940
I'm not going to let them
get away with this.

14
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,550
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

15
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,990
What? "Not going to let them
get away with this?"

16
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,990
As if you could do anything about it.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,260
Is something wrong?

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,360
Go to the office. Now.
There's something we need to take care of.

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,330
- What on earth...
- I said, go!

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,830
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

21
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,510
- I'm back.
- Jang Mi.

22
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,720
They must have something to hide.
That's why they took the banner down.

23
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,350
Dad?

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,720
- Jang Mi. Good, you're home.
- Why? What's going on?

25
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,490
- Our banner has been removed.
- What?

26
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,030
What do you mean?
How could it have been taken down so soon?

27
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,130
You know that lady who sells corn
from her truck in that neighborhood?

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,100
Yes, I know who you mean.
She works over in Taean.

29
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,670
I asked her for a favor.

30
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,110
I asked her to keep an eye on the banner
when she drives by.

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,810
But apparently, some public officials
showed up today,

32
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,710
said a complaint had been filed,
and took it down.

33
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,110
A complaint?

34
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,850
Unbelievable.

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,020
Some people have too much free time.
Who reports something like that?

36
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,490
I know, right?

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,090
This has to be the work of the people
who did this to Suk Hee...

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,530
That will be 18 dollars.

39
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,730
Yes, here you are.

40
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,000
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

41
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,040
(The banner has been removed.)

42
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
The banner has been removed.

43
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,280
Looks like you reported an illegal banner.

44
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,390
It was blocking a traffic light
and was a hazard.

45
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,690
So...

46
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,590
That's weird.

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,730
That customer from earlier also said
she reported an illegal banner...

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,300
Why are so many people filing complaints?

49
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Who did?

50
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, that customer who was just here.

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,270
She said she reported an illegal banner
because it was a driving hazard.

52
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,940
I can't tell you
how disheartening that was to hear.

53
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,310
Ours isn’t located anywhere
that would obstruct driving.

54
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,410
Exactly.

55
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,150
We desperately put up that banner,
and they can't even look the other way?

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,760
I almost told that customer off,
but I bit my tongue.

57
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,020
Good thing you did.

58
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,290
People like her will never understand
how desperate we are.

59
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,200
Anyway, don't you think the person
who reported our banner is suspicious?

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sure the person
who filed the complaint...

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,670
is connected to Suk Hee's accident.

62
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,910
You're right. I think so too.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,720
What's taking him so long?

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
So? How did it go?

65
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,730
Yes, it's been handled.

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,300
You made sure they can't find out
who filed the complaint, right?

67
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,440
Yes, don't worry.

68
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,080
Good. Let those pathetic fools
hang their banners.

69
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
A lot of good it will do them.

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,660
Knock, knock.

71
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,030
Chef Kang?

72
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
How about some tea?

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,310
Don't be so stuffy. It's our break time.

74
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,910
There's no reason we can't have
a cup of tea, is there?

75
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,450
Unlike some people, I'm not idle.

76
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,080
Playing hard to get
is only attractive in moderation.

77
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
And I'm not a very patient person.

78
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,790
Your patience won't be required.

79
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,860
You're a distraction. Please leave.

80
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,230
Jun Ho!

81
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Oh my goodness. Director Ma,
I didn't realize you were here.

82
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,900
You're on a first-name
basis with Chef Kang?

83
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Well...

84
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,710
We've just been close ever since
we were in school together.

85
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,680
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to work, of course,

86
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,310
unlike some people.

87
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,490
- Here are the junior chef résumés.
- Okay.

88
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,220
I'll review these, Assistant Manager Jin.

89
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,390
Director Ma, are you just going
to keep standing there?

90
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,130
Getting in my way?

91
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,860
Just pretend I'm your shadow.
Then I won't be in your way, will I?

92
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,910
You're sure CEO Chae isn't here, right?

93
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,540
I'm telling you, she's not.

94
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,710
The CEO should be at the office now.
Why would she be here?

95
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,350
She's the CEO.
She does whatever she wants.

96
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,420
So, what? You're saying
you don't believe me?

97
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,380
No, it's fine.
As long as Hwa Young isn't here.

98
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,320
Chairman! I'm here!

99
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,630
Darn it.

100
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,200
CEO Chae, Yeom San Wol just came home
and is meeting with the Chairman.

101
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeom San Wol.

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,440
So you're ignoring my warning
and picking a fight with me, is that it?

103
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,970
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

104
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,810
Don't you dare treat Mrs. Yeom
so disrespectfully.

105
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,650
If you keep treating Mrs. Yeom like that,
I won't let it slide.

106
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,050
Why aren't you saying anything?

107
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,450
Father.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,760
She's a friend of mine.

109
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,130
- How could you and my friend...
- Enough.

110
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,600
How dare you meddle
in your father-in-law's affairs?

111
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,600
Fine, Yeom San Wol.

112
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,270
I'll show you exactly
who you're messing with.

113
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,380
Take personnel action against Jin Hong Ju,
Yeom San Wol's daughter, immediately.

114
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,550
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,420
She should know by now
that the more she acts up,

116
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,360
the worse it will be for her daughter.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,700
If she's a fool,
she should know her place.

118
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,000
Who does she think she is, challenging me?

119
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
That feels so good.

120
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,670
See? This is why
I wish I could come every day...

121
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,810
and give you a nice massage, Chairman.

122
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,580
But I'm too afraid of CEO Chae
to even come here.

123
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,450
Don't worry.
I gave her a piece of my mind,

124
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,120
so CEO Chae won't be able
to say a thing to you.

125
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,190
- Really?
- Of course. You can bet on it.

126
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,520
Who would dare disobey me?

127
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,790
Chairman.

128
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,000
You're the only one
who ever looks out for me.

129
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,570
Thank you for saying that.

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Jang Mi.

131
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,510
Don't overdo it with your injured hand.
I'll do it.

132
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,420
It's fine, Dad. It's all healed.
I'm wearing a glove to keep it dry.

133
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,650
I swear, whoever did this
to my little princess's hand...

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,220
is going to get it from me.

135
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,490
Dad, do you really think
I would've just let it go?

136
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,960
I already taught them a lesson.

137
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,900
I get my temper from you, you know.

138
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,670
What?

139
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
That's my girl.

140
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,080
"Let's Have a Drink" is a dance-trot song.

141
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,610
Dance-trot.
Not that old-fashioned cheesy stuff.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,320
You have to go full-throttle
the whole time. Got it?

143
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,920
- Right.
- Listen.

144
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,060
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

145
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,360
<i>Let's go all night long</i>
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

146
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,090
<i>Tonight</i>, right here,

147
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,960
Make the "o" sound a little nasally.

148
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,830
It has to be cutesy like this.

149
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Oh.

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Oh.

151
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,270
Just copy him, Tae Pyung.

152
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,210
It's okay. Just relax and follow his lead.

153
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,950
You must nail the audition today, right?

154
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,460
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

155
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,830
<i>Let's go all night long</i>
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

156
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,160
<i>Tonight, you and I</i>

157
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,330
Hold on!

158
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,330
Hey, stop with the cheesy old-school vibe.

159
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,570
I'm sorry, sir.
He's not normally like this.

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm sorry to ask, sir,
could you please show me again?

161
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,780
All right, last time. Listen up.
You know I was in Special Forces, right?

162
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,480
- Yes, sir.
- Focus!

163
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,550
Focus!

164
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,320
Here I go.

165
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,950
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

166
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,260
<i>Let's go all night long</i>
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

167
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,290
<i>Do the money spin</i>

168
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,090
<i>And another one</i>

169
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,430
<i>- And keep drinking</i>
- Excuse me, sir.

170
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Are you laughing?

171
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,010
- No.
- Are you messing with me?

172
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,710
- No, sir!
- Sit! Stand! About-face! Hit the deck!

173
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,110
Hey, wait a second. Hey!
What's your father do?

174
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,550
My father runs a side dish shop.

175
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,890
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

176
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,990
<i>Let's go all night long</i>
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

177
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,060
<i>Tonight, you and I</i>

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,830
<i>We'll become one and keep drinking</i>

179
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,900
That's enough.

180
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,640
I'll find you another place to sing.
For now, just go and wait.

181
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,710
I have other songs.

182
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,850
- Please give me one more chance...
- Quiet.

183
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,460
What's your plan?

184
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,030
Why would you go to the trouble
of having Oh Tae Pyung sing?

185
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,510
A song that doesn't suit him
in the slightest, no less.

186
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,010
Kang Hyuk, contact the head of the agency.

187
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,810
Get Oh Tae Pyung a gig on some small stage
out in the boonies.

188
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,920
That's not difficult, though.

189
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,150
I don't understand why you want
to get Oh Tae Pyung a gig...

190
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,720
You've been by my side for so long,
and you still can't figure me out?

191
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,930
Jung Suk Hee may have the mind of a child,
but she's still alive, right?

192
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,760
And since she's alive,
who knows what variables might arise?

193
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,570
Whether she'll remain
an amnesiac half-wit...

194
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,070
or get struck by lightning
and snap out of it, nobody knows.

195
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I see.

196
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,670
So you want to use Oh Tae Pyung
to keep an eye on her.

197
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,180
Shouldn't we create a way
to maintain contact with them?

198
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,580
That way, if the worst should happen,
we'll be able to handle it.

199
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,060
Chin up, Oh Tae Pyung.

200
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,430
Thanks. Tomorrow is another day.

201
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,330
That's the spirit.

202
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,970
You know, it's really strange.

203
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,740
Being at that hotel jogged my memory.

204
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,070
About what?

205
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,510
Never mind.

206
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,510
Could she be a doppelganger?

207
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,150
I'm Ma Seo Rin.
I'm the Director of Food and Beverage.

208
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,620
And when did you have time
to change your clothes?

209
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,090
You weren't wearing your glasses earlier.

210
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,290
What are you talking about?

211
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,320
Get out of my way. I'm trying to work.

212
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,960
There are probably a lot of look-alikes
in the world, right?

213
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,660
Where did that come from?

214
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,500
It's just something.

215
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,600
It's just that this one rude girl
keeps popping up.

216
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,010
By the way, take good care of that thing
my sister asked you about, okay?

217
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
Of course.

218
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,080
Thanks for everything.

219
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,610
I know you're busy with your law practice,
but you're helping me, and my sister too.

220
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,650
Is "thank you" all I'm getting?

221
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,390
You've never invited me to your place.

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,990
- Are you hiding a stash of gold in there?
- Alright, I understand.

223
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,190
I'll invite you over
and treat you to a proper feast.

224
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,390
- Sounds good! I get to see your sister.
- You little...

225
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,570
- So you had an ulterior motive.
- Hey, killing two birds with one stone.

226
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,240
- Really?
- Yes, so when should I have him over?

227
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,370
That lawyer friend of yours?

228
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,980
You're saying that lawyer
is interested in our Jang Mi?

229
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,410
Jang Mi's hand hurts.
Jang Mi has a boo-boo.

230
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,090
He seemed really curious about her.

231
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,960
We've never even met.
What's he so curious about?

232
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,660
Lawyer Kang is only interested
because of me...

233
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,900
since you're my little sister.
Why else would he be interested in you?

234
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,900
I guess so,

235
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,870
but don't you think it might be
because we spoke on the phone a few times?

236
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,300
Right. Jang Mi has a point.

237
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,580
Jang Mi has a voice like a songbird.
Plus, she's sweet and refined.

238
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,950
Anyone who talks to her on the phone
is bound to be charmed by her.

239
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,280
But is he handsome?

240
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,460
No, wait, what's he like as a person?
What matters most is that he's a good man.

241
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
He has to be kind.

242
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,690
Come on, Dad. Are you trying to find me
a husband or something?

243
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,300
Come on. You're all getting way ahead
of yourselves.

244
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,130
Dad, he's a lawyer.
Are we even in his league?

245
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,200
Jang Mi, don't you
get your hopes up, either.

246
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,740
You're the one getting ahead of yourself.
Who said I was getting my hopes up?

247
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,280
When did you say you were
inviting the lawyer over?

248
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,650
Tell me.

249
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,750
Mom, is Dad still not home?

250
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,720
I know. For some reason,
your dad has been late every day.

251
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,590
Is he having an affair or something?

252
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Kang Baek Ho.

253
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,190
Don't be ridiculous.

254
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:02,900
Your father would be the last man in Korea
to have an affair.

255
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,800
Come on, Mom. How can you be so sure?
Dad is still a man, you know.

256
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,710
If I don't know your father, who does?

257
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
With that germaphobia of his...

258
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,480
He's too timid to ever cheat.

259
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,010
And besides,

260
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,880
why on earth would your father
ever betray me?

261
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,390
Your dad only has eyes for me.

262
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,330
Okay. I know how much Dad loves you.

263
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,570
Thank you...

264
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,370
for letting me cry.

265
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,080
I've always seen you
as a glamorous and untouchable icon.

266
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,780
And now...

267
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,350
you're my icon.

268
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Excuse me?

269
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,060
Because you understood how I feel.

270
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,950
Surely Father...

271
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,920
wouldn't bring Yeom San Wol home,
would he?

272
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,760
No, that's absolutely out of the question.

273
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,260
Mom, aren't you going to eat?

274
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,530
Father.

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,770
What if we expedited the process
of making Seo Rin the successor?

276
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,270
I thought you said I couldn't
until I showed some results.

277
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,340
If you take Seo Rin
to meet the directors...

278
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,650
and help her make an impression,
it'll be a much faster process.

279
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,220
- It clearly shows you approve of Seo Rin.
- I'm in.

280
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,990
At least it's not boring with you,
Grandpa.

281
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,160
You little rascal,
do you just come to work to see me?

282
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,630
It's no fun. Everyone is so incompetent.

283
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,860
Incompetent? What do you mean?

284
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,930
They should just get to the point,
but they always beat around the bush.

285
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,200
It's so frustrating I could scream.

286
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,510
Excuse me.

287
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,010
Yes, miss?

288
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,140
Where are the eyeballs?
Where did the eyeballs go?

289
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,880
They removed the eyeballs
at the market for me.

290
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,550
I've lost my appetite.

291
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,590
- Without eyeballs, I don't want to eat.
- Goodness, you like the eyeballs so much?

292
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,960
This won't do.

293
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,260
Go to the fish market
and gather up every eyeball you can find,

294
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,960
and make some porridge for her.

295
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,760
Would there be a place
that only sells fish eyeballs?

296
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,130
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

297
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,980
Assistant Manager Jin Hong Ju's
transfer notice has been posted.

298
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Is it true?

299
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,360
Did the Chairman really give CEO Chae
a piece of his mind?

300
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,530
He sure did.

301
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,900
So what if Hwa Young tried to warn me?

302
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,830
The Chairman ignored her...

303
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,340
and told me to come home. What can she do?

304
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,970
She'll just have to suck it up.

305
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,480
So, Mom, stop cowering
every time CEO Chae says something to you,

306
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,350
you need to tighten the reins on her.

307
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,890
All right, I get it.
I have nothing to lose now.

308
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,060
Here, have some of this.

309
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,190
And make sure to put in a good word for me
with the Chairman.

310
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,930
I'm doing all the real work at the hotel.
Why am I still just an assistant manager?

311
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,900
(Effective October 6, 2025,
Assistant Manager Jin Hong Ju...)

312
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,070
(transferred to the branch
in New Delhi, India)

313
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,070
This is ridiculous.

314
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Mom.

315
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
What is it?

316
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,880
Oh my godness.
What is this outrageous nonsense?

317
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,350
They're sending you to India,
of all places.

318
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,720
Has Hwa Young lost her mind?
Is she insane?

319
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,690
Does she really think
I'll just go quietly?

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm not going. No way.

321
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,530
It looks like Hwa Young
still doesn't get the picture,

322
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,710
she's completely clueless about
how much the Chairman favors me.

323
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,170
That's why she'd pull a disloyal stunt
like this.

324
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,410
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

325
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,830
Have some tea, Assistant Manager Jin.

326
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,300
It's a Darjeeling I've been saving
for a special occasion.

327
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,530
It's from India.

328
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,770
I cannot accept this, ma'am.

329
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,240
Why India all of a sudden?

330
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,810
- What am I supposed to do in India?
- What do you mean?

331
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,380
You know how huge India's population is,
don't you?

332
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,310
- Do some market research...
- Ma'am.

333
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,780
That's rich, Assistant Manager Jin.

334
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,790
You were thrilled about the US training.
So what's wrong with India?

335
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,890
Why are you making such a fuss about it?

336
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,090
Technically, it was the Chairman
who sent me for that training, not you.

337
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,630
So you're refusing to go to India?

338
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Ma'am...

339
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,770
Listen to me carefully.

340
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm transferring you to India...

341
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,270
so you can go to a larger market,
broaden your horizons,

342
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,110
and gain more experience.
I'm giving you an opportunity.

343
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,280
And the board of directors agrees.

344
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,980
It's a waste to let a talent like you
rot away in one place.

345
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,560
Don't give it a second thought.
Just hand over your duties by month's end.

346
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,490
And get ready to leave for India.

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll have to think about it.

348
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,840
Jung Suk Hee.

349
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,350
Now, you just need to stay quiet,
just like you are now,

350
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,980
and remain a half-wit forever.

351
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,050
Got it?

352
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,730
You'll approve the banner?

353
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:38,800
Thank you so much.

354
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
Okay.

355
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,770
Dad!

356
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,840
The county office
just approved the banner.

357
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,900
That's a relief. That's great news.

358
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,380
Dad, Jang Mi! I finally got a job!

359
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,540
What? Where?

360
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,710
It's not a prime venue,
but I finally get to perform on stage.

361
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,550
Really?

362
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,190
Who on earth hired you?

363
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,790
I passed an audition.

364
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,760
Dream Hotel's CEO was moved by my singing
and set it up for me.

365
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,260
Tae Pyung said he'd buy a gift
for Ok Hee and Tok Hee.

366
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,870
Is that for real?

367
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,670
Just don't get scammed this time.
I'm worried you won't really get on stage.

368
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,340
- Dad, don't be such a killjoy.
- He's right, Dad.

369
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,710
Tae Pyung, good luck!
I'm so happy for you!

370
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,680
But wait,
Dream Hotel's CEO was moved by your song?

371
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,280
Am I really supposed to believe that?

372
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,920
- Jang Mi, you've become bold.
- Anyway, congratulations.

373
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,320
- You can do it.
- I've got this.

374
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,910
- Rookie.
- Yes, Chef.

375
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
Eat it.

376
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,650
- Excuse me?
- I said, eat it.

377
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,760
How is it?

378
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,900
- It's delicious.
- Delicious?

379
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,330
So pasta covered in dish soap
tastes good to you?

380
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,370
You're fired. Get out.

381
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,210
I'm sorry, sir.
It will never happen again.

382
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,210
A mistake?
You don't even have the basics down.

383
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,840
Got it? Now get out!

384
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,710
Didn't I tell you to get out?

385
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,280
What's going on here?

386
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,520
Our customers pay good money
to come to this restaurant,

387
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,850
so shouldn't we give them
their money's worth?

388
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,790
- Everyone, get back to cooking.
- Are you really firing her?

389
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,230
Didn't you hear me?

390
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,760
Won't we be short-handed if you fire her?

391
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,000
You have to think about the strain
it'll put on the other chefs.

392
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Ma'am.

393
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,910
This is my kitchen.

394
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,780
So, you want me to mind my own business?

395
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,250
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

396
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,010
I'm here as a customer.

397
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,350
I'm hungry.
Is my food coming out any time soon?

398
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,320
Running things like this,

399
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,590
I'm extremely concerned...

400
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,320
about how you're going to meet
my two-month sales target.

401
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,570
Here, a present for you.

402
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,610
It's got a bit of a story,
which is why it's late.

403
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,380
This looks expensive!

404
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,420
I don't know what the story is,
but thanks, Baek Ho.

405
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,550
So, is she your mother?

406
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,290
Right.

407
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,190
You've never met my mom before, have you?

408
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,590
That's why I've been hesitant
to invite friends over.

409
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,630
Really?

410
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,970
If my mom hadn't gotten injured,
she could've been your senior.

411
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,470
- My senior?
- My mom passed part one of the bar exam,

412
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,010
but she was in an accident
before she could take the second part.

413
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,280
So she's got beauty and brains?

414
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,490
- Hey, your sister must be gorgeous then.
- Why you...

415
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,890
Jang Mi is pretty.

416
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,020
Tae Pyung is nice.

417
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,960
Jang Mi is pretty.

418
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,930
Huh? This is the bathhouse for my bunny.

419
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,270
What do you mean?

420
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,640
Mom, this is my guitar.

421
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,910
- No, Jang Mi gave this to me. It's mine.
- No, Mom.

422
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,880
- Mom, wait.
- It's mine.

423
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,650
My bunny's bathhouse.

424
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,990
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

425
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,330
(CEO's Office)

426
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,600
- They've put the banner back up.
- What?

427
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,100
And it looks like they got a permit
from the district office this time.

428
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,770
Those low-lives...

429
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,410
See? What did I tell you?
They're relentless.

430
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,780
That's the thing about these low-lives.
They just won't give up.

431
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,020
What are your orders?
Should I have it taken down?

432
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,120
Why are you even asking?
Tell them to tear it down!

433
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,530
Hello, Ssangkal.

434
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,660
Tear down that banner
without anyone seeing you.

435
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,870
And be careful not to get caught.

436
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,280
I wonder what Lawyer Kang looks like.

437
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,150
He's here.

438
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,990
- Come on in.
- Oh my gosh, what do I do?

439
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,560
Make yourself at home.

440
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,230
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Kang Baek Ho...

441
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,360
Welcome.

442
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,070
What?

443
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
You!

444
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,020
(The First Man)

445
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,920
I'll have them removed
by the end of today.

446
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,060
They just won't quit.

447
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,430
That's why we have to rip them out
by the roots.

448
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,830
Lawyer Kang, we need to talk.

449
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,470
I only kept quiet
to save you the embarrassment.

450
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,400
Do you think I'd choose my love
over my own daughter?

451
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,770
- You're in love with the Chairman?
- I love the Chairman!

452
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,570
Enough.
