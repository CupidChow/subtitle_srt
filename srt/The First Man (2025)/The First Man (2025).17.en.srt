1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,770
You'll be able to achieve
your dream soon enough,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,210
- so please try not to be so impatient.
- When? When is that going to be?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,980
With that old fox stabbing me in the back,
just when is that supposed to happen?

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,660
Just you wait.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm going to take over all of Dream!

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,930
(Episode 17)

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,370
Hold on.

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,210
Gosh, that's hot!

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,610
Oh, no. My mistake.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,680
Director Ma!

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,280
I said it was an accident.
Don't you ever make mistakes?

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,050
What's with the death glare?

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,790
I know perfectly well
you spilled that on me on purpose.

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,060
It won't kill you. Don't be so dramatic.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,470
You know, you're quite a little actress.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,870
Did you put on that "resigning" act
just to pull off this stunt today?

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,940
The Chairman told me not to say anything.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,610
I see.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,210
What, are you bragging now
that you've got my grandpa in your corner?

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,610
Does it look like I'm bragging?

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,720
You saw it with your own two eyes,
didn't you?

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,650
At Chang Restaurant.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,360
You saw how Grandpa flipped out
at what I said.

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,460
He can't just ignore what I say.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,930
So you'd better tell your mother.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,470
Tell her not to get her hopes up
about marrying into my family.

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,670
Got it?

28
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,510
I'll get this.
I'm the one with the money, after all.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Why don't you finish your coffee?

30
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,290
Ma Seo Rin.

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,160
You'll find out soon enough.

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,030
That it won't be long
until my mom becomes your grandmother.

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,600
Both my mom and I...

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,200
have staked our whole lives on that day.

35
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,100
Today is the last day
I let you cross the line.

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,410
All right, Singer Oh. Eat up, okay?

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,120
Dad, what's the special occasion?

38
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,690
Singer Oh? I like it.
You're Singer Oh now!

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,790
Tae Pyung can sing. Tae Pyung's a singer!

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,830
But thanks to you, Mom,
no one even got to see me sing.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,930
- Dream Hotel's CEO was there too.
- The CEO of Dream Hotel was?

42
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,770
Yes. She's my generous sponsor.

43
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,200
Really?
We should have gone and thanked her.

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,570
I feel so bad about that.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,770
Dad.

46
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,040
Why don't I bring her
one of our lunch boxes later?

47
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,310
A lunch box? You think that'd be okay?

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,350
That's a great idea.
I mean, the CEO has to eat too, right?

49
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,820
Right. Someone like her
probably has a refined palate,

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,090
and I'm not sure
if she'll like our lunch boxes,

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,820
but if she doesn't want it,
I guess she can just give it to her staff.

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,090
Exactly, Dad.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,600
By the way, Singer Oh,
that live music bar must be pretty famous.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,230
My Jang Mi is gone.

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,300
- Jang Mi!
- It's okay, Suk Hee. She will be back.

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,270
What's taking her so long?

57
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,610
I saw one of our regular customers there.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,580
Would you like me to get you some tea
to help you calm down?

59
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,060
(Professor Kang sent a photo.)

60
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,300
Go right now and find out
what position he gave Jin Hong Ju.

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
That old man.

62
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,200
He wouldn't dare promote Jin Hong Ju
to team leader or manager, would he?

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,570
Right away.

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,940
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

65
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,480
I just can't let my guard down
for a second.

66
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,660
The white clouds in the blue sky
look just like angels.

67
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,930
They look just like you, you know?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I miss you.

69
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,000
He has a surprisingly naive side to him.

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,710
And a bit of a romantic streak too.

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,450
He's my only source of comfort.

72
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,060
So what if Ma Seo Rin
joins the opposition?

73
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,330
You think the Chairman
would even bat an eye?

74
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,000
The problem is that it'll take time.

75
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,100
Gosh, I just want to crush
that little brat.

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,200
Then I'd feel like
I could finally breathe again.

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,870
You're right. Goodness.

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,040
Just think of all the tears you've cried
over that little nobody, Seo Rin.

79
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,510
Enough to fill an ocean.

80
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,250
The way she mocked, belittled,
and tormented me...

81
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,520
Once you marry the Chairman,

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,320
I'll make her pay
for every last bit of it.

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,660
I'll make her suffer, piece by piece.

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,890
That's right, sweetie.

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,130
I'll get them back for all your suffering
in one fell swoop.

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,300
So, how am I going to wrap that old man
around my little finger?

87
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,580
Hello?

88
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,620
Chairman, it's Hong Ju.

89
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,550
Hi. Did you get home all right?

90
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,420
Something awful has happened.

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,490
What's wrong? What happened?

92
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,890
My mom...

93
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,030
has been in bed for days.
She can't even keep a sip of water down.

94
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,200
She's completely bedridden.

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,570
Gosh, so that's it.

96
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,940
I imagine she's very disappointed
she couldn't be with me.

97
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,650
I'm afraid so.

98
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,380
Ever since she had dinner with you,
she took to her bed that very day.

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,420
She hasn't been able to get up since.

100
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,190
Chairman.

101
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,300
I have a favor to ask.

102
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,570
Could you please come to our house...

103
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,510
and check in on my mother?

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,810
If she sees you,

105
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,980
I think she'll get her strength back...

106
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,820
to at least drink some water.

107
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,120
I know I'm overstepping,

108
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,720
but I must beg you.

109
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,690
All right, I understand.
Put your mother on the phone.

110
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,130
Sorry?

111
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,730
Just a moment, please.

112
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,600
She's so weak,

113
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,870
so I don't know if she can even talk
on the phone.

114
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,340
Just a second.

115
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,710
What do we do?

116
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
Mom.

117
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,110
Mom, pull yourself together.
It's the Chairman.

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,650
Can you talk to him?

119
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,220
- Come on, try, Mom.
- Gosh.

120
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,990
Hello?

121
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,360
Mrs. Yeom. Are you really that sick?

122
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,600
Wait... Chairman.

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,670
Listen, I'm sending Dr. Kim over.
He can give you an IV drip for now.

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,900
I'll be there shortly.

125
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,510
Hello? Chairman? Gosh, he just hung up.

126
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,740
- Darn.
- Gosh.

127
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,480
Seriously! What are we going to do?

128
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,920
- When Dr. Kim gets here, the jig is up.
- What are we going to do?

129
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,290
Gosh, he's so shrewd.
Just like a chairman should be.

130
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,220
Quick, lie down! Come on, lie down!

131
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,360
- Here? Like this? How?
- Goodness.

132
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,120
Darn it.
You're supposed to be on your deathbed!

133
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,230
You look way too healthy!

134
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,130
My goodness,
the things you say to your own mother!

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,930
Go get my makeup.

136
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,900
Time to work some makeup magic.
What other choice do we have?

137
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,910
All that time I spent as an assistant
to the star Chae Hwa Young...

138
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,210
is finally about to pay off.

139
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,250
That's where I learned to do stage makeup,
you know.

140
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,480
Gosh, but Chairman Ma is a sly old fox.

141
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,480
I don't know if he'll fall for it.

142
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,890
We have to do whatever it takes
to get what we want.

143
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,060
What other choice do we have?

144
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,330
Three or four should be enough, right?

145
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,070
Yes, that's plenty
to share with the staff.

146
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,400
You'll be okay going by yourself?

147
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,870
Dad, what do you take me for,
a little kid?

148
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,370
Okay. Make sure to thank her.

149
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,810
She's really saved Tae Pyung, hasn't she?

150
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,180
I know. After he got scammed
and lost money so many times,

151
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,150
he's finally getting to sing
on a real stage.

152
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll go and thank her profusely.

153
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,220
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

154
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,290
Be safe.

(Dream Hotel, Grand Reopening)

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,810
My hand is all better now,

158
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,410
but since I started
my lunch box delivery business,

159
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,620
I can't just get a job at a restaurant.

160
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,050
Since I'm here, I might as well try to see
Chef Kang Jun Ho before I leave.

161
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,810
Director Ma Seo Rin.

162
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,610
- Yes?
- Do you know what my staff is saying?

163
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,420
Rumors say I'm about to get fired
from this restaurant, all because of you.

164
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,620
- Because of me?
- Why should I suffer because of you?

165
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,060
Don't pay any attention to the rumors.

166
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,360
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
you're more thin-skinned than you look.

167
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,600
As long as I'm fine with it,
what's there to worry about?

168
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,830
I want to be judged fairly on my skills,

169
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,670
but you're making that impossible.

170
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,440
The results aren't even out yet.

171
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,910
And if you do get fired,

172
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,210
you can just marry me.

176
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,270
Sorry? No.

177

184
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Yes.

so you can head home for the day.

186

CEO Chae.

187
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,350
I was just wondering
who you're going with.

188
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,820
And why would you need to know that?
How presumptuous.

189
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,790
Lee Kang Hyuk,
don't cross the line. Got it?

190
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,900
I'm here to deliver this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young.

191
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,660
I'm sorry, but this is a restricted area.

192
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,830
I'll make sure she gets it,
so you can just give it to me.

193
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,900
Well...

194
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,640
Please tell her it's a thank-you gift
from the singer, Tae Pyung.

195
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,310
Please tell her that.

196

to CEO Chae Hwa Young too.

- I will.
- Okay, thank you.

199

Gosh, she looks exactly like Director Ma.

200
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,000

for you.

201

- A lunch box?
- Yes, she just left.

202

You can have it. I have an appointment,
so I have to go.

203

My dear, just because you can't marry me,

204
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,090
you can't be this heartbroken, can you?

205
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,220
How could a lowly person like me...

206
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,360
hope to be with you, Chairman?

207
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,600
For Director Ma and CEO Chae
to be against it...

208
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,600
is only natural.

209
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,740
Come on, cheer up. Okay?

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,470
- I'll reconsider.
- What?

211
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,010
Do you really mean it?

212
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
Goodness.

213
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm so drained,
I don't have the energy to be happy.

214
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,550
Just focus on getting back on your feet.

215

Besides, who else do I have now?

216
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,950
The only one who knows
exactly what I need...

217
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,760
is you, Mrs. Yeom.

- Right.

221
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,000
I hear it's pretty well known.

- and bean sprouts too. Baek Ho, eat up.
- Thank you.

Gosh, what's the point of being a lawyer
if you can't make it to a meal on time?

227
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,140
I'm a bit late
because I was coming from court.

229
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,080
So dinner was just an excuse.
He came to see my Jang Mi.

She'll be back soon.

- You're back? Talk about timing.

- Okay, Suk Hee's getting ice cream!

Tell Jang Mi what you told me earlier.

all right?

237

Who says you can only hang them outdoors?

242
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,690
You're right.
We could advertise at Dangjang Market.

243
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,500
Thanks to you, Professor,
I feel completely refreshed today.

244

I do have a name, you know.

245
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,370
Oh, my.
Should I call you by your name then?

246

256
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,150
I have insomnia,
so I have trouble sleeping,

257
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,290

talking on the phone with you.

I guess he felt bad our move-in plans
were ruined by that brat Ma Seo Rin.

281

- No, we can't.

Who?

344
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,860
I mean, it's not like you'd know who it is
if I told you, Lawyer Kang.

345
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,100
Why are you leaving already?

346
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,600
Does she really have a crush on someone?

347
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,310
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

348
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,610
So this is that place
with the amazing lunch boxes?

349
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,580
- Yes. You tried the one I gave you?
- Right.

350
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,710
It's incredible.

351
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,050
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

352
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,350
Let's see.

353
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,420
Thanks for calling Suk Hee's Side Dishes,
home of healthy, heartfelt food.

354
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,930
Yes, an order? Of course. We deliver.

355
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,330
This is Chang Restaurant. We'd like
to order six lunch boxes for delivery.

356
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,470
Excuse me? Chang Restaurant?

357
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,310
You mean the one inside the Dream Hotel?

358
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,780
Right. Yes, I understand.

359
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,910
Thank you.
We'll have it there in a flash. Okay.

360
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,050
Oh, my gosh! Dad!

361
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,690
Chef Kang's restaurant ordered from us!
How did they even hear about us?

362
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,230
I might even get to see Chef Kang Jun Ho
when I go!

363
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,490
Goodness,
you're really that happy about it?

364
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,530
Of course I am! He's my idol.

365
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,700
If only I hadn't hurt my hand,
I could have been working for Chef Kang.

366
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,210
Right. Have you found the jerk
who did that to your hand yet?

367
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,140
If I ever get my hands on that punk,
I'll wring his neck.

368
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,150
Dad, calm down. Your blood pressure.

369
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,550
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Anyway, I'll be right back.

370
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,550
Yes, okay. Go on.

371
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,860
I've scheduled your physical therapy
session for 4 p.m.

372
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,930
When you get stressed,
your whole body tenses up.

373
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,390
You know how your muscles get all knotted.

374
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,360
That's how you've gotten hurt
so many times.

375
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
Do I look like I have time
for a physical therapy session right now?

376
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,200
Not when he promoted Jin Hong Ju
just to shove her in my face.

377
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,340
Chairman Ma is just sending a message...

378
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,680
that he's still in control.
You shouldn't let it get to you.

379
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,780
Right.
I've waited and held on for 30 years.

380
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,980
What's a few more years to me?

381
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,950
Let that old fool, Chairman Ma,
pull whatever stunts he wants.

382
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,860
A shopping basket? Seriously?
As a singer, I have an image to uphold.

383
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,030
Hey, Singer Oh.
Give it a rest, will you? Seriously.

384
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,570
Oh, right. Baek Ho posted
on Dangjang Market...

385
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,670
a "Help us find the banner vandal" post.

386
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,770
I think he got a few useful leads, Dad.

387
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,210
Oh, did he?

388
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,100
Aren't you Tae Sook?

389
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Oh, it's Tae Sook!

390
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,410
Tae Sook's here.

391
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,870
Dad!

392
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,340
Hey! What are you doing here?

393
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
Tae Sook!

394
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,780
Hi. Hey, Bo Ra.
Say hi to Grandpa and your uncle.

395
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,590
Okay. Hello.

396
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,760
Hello to you too.

397
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,330
Mom, you haven't changed a bit.

398
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,680
- Lunch box delivery? Let me take that.
- Oh, yes.

399
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,520
Does Chef Kang Jun Ho eat these too,
by any chance?

400
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,150
It's just that I admire him so much.

401
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,090
I'm sorry. You should go eat
before your break is over.

402
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

403
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,430
Oh, my gosh. She's the spitting image
of Director Ma.

404
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
What is it?

405
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,130
Oh, the lunch boxes.

406
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,130
We ordered from here because it's amazing.

407
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,100
Goodness.

408
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,080
I can't believe I almost ran into
Chef Kang Jun Ho looking like this.

409
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,550
Oh, well. I'm just happy I got to see him
after all this time.

410
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,690
I'll bring the car around.

411
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Seo Rin.

412
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,700
(The First Man)

413
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,610
She must be a look-alike.
So many people look alike.

414
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,410
Please don't let her be
Jung Suk Hee's daughter.

415
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,250
What's got you in such a good mood?

416
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,450
I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

417
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,450
Wait, Chef Kang Jun Ho is the one
you have a crush on?

418
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,020
Welcome.

419
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,490
Time to find out for sure.

420
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
We're in big trouble.

421
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,160
Oh Tae Pyung is on his way there!
Get out of there now.

422
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,730
CEO Chae?

423
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
