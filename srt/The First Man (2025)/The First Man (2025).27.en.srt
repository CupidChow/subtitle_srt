00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,140
(Episode 27)

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,870
Line it up well from the angle below.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,330
Don't mess this up.

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,570
Got it.

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,350
Fifty meters.

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,220
Aim carefully.

7
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,990
Precisely.

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,060
Ten.

9
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,990
Nine.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Eight.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
Seven.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Six.

13
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,570
Five.

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
Four.

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
Three.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,940
Two.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
One.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,940
Now!

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,850
(Mazen PC Station)

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
Jang Mi!

21
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,280
Who's that guy?

22
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,460
Kang Baek Ho?

23
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,030
How could you screw that up?

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,560
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,510
Jang Mi, are you okay?

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,510
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,350
What about you, Baek Ho? Are you hurt?

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,420
I'm fine. That was way too close.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,220
- What is wrong with you people?
- We're so sorry.

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,330
Is anyone hurt?

31
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,930
- We'll compensate you for this.
- You think money is the problem here?

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,160
She could have been killed!

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,170
- You need to be careful!
- I'm sorry.

34
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,240
Do you think saying sorry fixes things
after you almost kill someone?

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,010
That's enough. We're not hurt,
so let's just drop it.

36
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,280
I'm sure it was an accident.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,280
Right! My interview.

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,780
I have to get to my interview.

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,050
Wait, Jang Mi, are you okay?

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,450
Are you sure you're okay?
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,220
- Yes, I'm fine.
- What do you mean you're fine?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,500
You failed again?

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
What's your excuse this time?

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,470
I gave you the exact time.
How could you mess up something so simple?

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,210
Kang Baek Ho saved her again,

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,710
so, unfortunately, we failed.

47
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,810
Kang Baek Ho?

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,750
Yes, Professor Kang Nam Bong's son.

49
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,020
I was so sure it would work this time,

50
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,560
but Kang Baek Ho showed up
and saved her in the nick of time.

51
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,230
We're running out of time!

52
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,030
We can't just let Oh Jang Mi
run around freely.

53
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,570
What if she comes back here
and runs into Seo Rin or Kang Jun Ho?

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,410
Oh Jang Mi is a ticking time bomb. Got it?

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,240
Darn it!

56
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,080
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
Slippery little wench.

58
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,050
You're so good at getting away.

59
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,390
What do I have to do to make you disappear
from my sight forever?

60
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,230
Kang Baek Ho.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,700
So you're the one who
keeps saving Oh Jang Mi, is that it?

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll have to get you away from her.
This can't go on.

63
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,410
Jang Mi, what happened? Are you hurt?

64
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm okay. I'm just a little shaken up.

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,690
Baek Ho, I'm fine now.

66
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,090
Come on, how can you be okay?
You must've been so scared.

67
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,420
Sir, do you happen to have anything
to help calm her nerves?

68
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,630
Yes, I do.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,690
Goodness, what on earth happened?

70
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,660
What? A sign fell?

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,630
Yes, Baek Ho is my lifesaver.

72
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,970
But I'm worried
because I missed my interview.

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,570
Is that really what's important right now?

74
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,380
Thank you so much.
Here, please have a drink.

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Thank you.

76
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,180
This traditional sweet rice drink
is delicious. It really hits the spot.

77
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,320
Many customers are asking for it.
Maybe we should start selling it?

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,560
This is hardly the time
to be talking about the drink.

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,790
If it weren't for Lawyer Kang,
you wouldn't even be here to taste it.

80
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Lawyer Kang, you're a lifesaver.
A true lifesaver. Thank you.

81
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,060
It was nothing.
I just did what had to be done.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,440
But seriously, why would a sign
just fall out of the blue like that?

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,570
Dad, the workers installing the sign
just dropped it by accident.

84
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,010
- Dad, you're worrying over nothing again.
- But something seems off.

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,150
- What is?
- I suspect a crime against Jang Mi.

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
What?

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,080
Think about it.

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,050
Jang Mi has recently had
a few near-death experiences, right?

89
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,160
Last time, a car sped right at her,
and now a sign almost fell on her head.

90
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,390
Come on, that's a bit of a stretch.

91
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,900
Why would anyone intentionally
try to kill me?

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,200
Besides, the workers apologized
for dropping the sign.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,470
- Maybe not?
- Right. That does seem a bit much.

94
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,540
Anyway, Jang Mi, be careful out there.

95
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,140
If anything happens to you,

96
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,710
I just can't go on.

97
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,210
I will, Dad.

98
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,090
Here. Mrs. Yeom chose
these very carefully.

99
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,460
They’d all be great matches for you.
Just meet them, Seo Rin.

100
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,160
Give them to Jin Hong Ju, Grandpa.

101
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,160
- But I have Jun Ho.
- You little...

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,770
You think I don't know
you manipulated Team Leader Jin?

103
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,840
You were just showing me Chef Kang
to see if I'd approve of him for you.

104
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,570
So, what do you think, Grandpa?
Chef Kang is wonderful, isn't he?

105
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,440
You little brat. I don't approve.

106
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,450
You're my precious granddaughter,
the apple of my eye.

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,450
Who does that punk think he is,
not even giving you the time of day?

108
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,820
The arrogant jerk.

109
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,690
He should be on his knees begging
for a chance with you.

110
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,720
That's what I like about him, Grandpa.

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,460
Every other guy only saw me as the heiress
to the Dream Group.

112
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,260
And that was so boring.

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
- Was it?
- It was.

114
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,230
But Jun Ho has no interest
in my background at all.

115
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,740
You little rascal...

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,070
So please, Grandpa, reconsider him
as a potential match for me. Please?

117
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,940
He just sees me as Ma Seo Rin, the person.
How amazing is that?

118
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,580
- I think that's so much fun.
- For goodness' sake.

119
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,220
Grandpa, just trust me and be patient.

120
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,120
I'm going to make Jun Ho
fall in love with me.

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
I know how stubborn you are,

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,330
but you can't force love.

123
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,870
You think I'm coming on too strong?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,770
You need to step back a little, you see?

125
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,280
You can't see a painting properly
if you're too close to it.

126
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,210
You have to step back
to appreciate the whole picture.

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,720
Love is the same way.

128
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,550
Okay, I get it.

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,150
I'll keep your advice in mind, Grandpa.

130
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,270
Jin Hong Ju.

131
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,130
You want to meet them?

132
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,770
No, thank you.

133
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,540
They're for you to meet, Director Ma.
Why would I?

134
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,510
Then why were you eavesdropping?

135
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,010
You were hoping to pick up my leftovers
if I said no, weren't you?

136
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,450
She reads you like a book.

137
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,850
That's not true.

138
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,820
Really? Fine, whatever.

139
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,960
This is your fault, Mom.

140
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,030
What's wrong with her?

141
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,640
What am I supposed to do?
Ma Seo Rin left with the profiles.

142
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,070
Seo Rin is such a strange kid.

143
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,580
One minute she seems like
a clueless, arrogant brat,

144
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,210
and the next she's uncannily wise,
like she's seen it all.

145
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,580
She's as sly as an old fox.

146
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,850
I just can't figure that girl out.

147
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,120
- Is she brilliant or just an idiot?
- She's just an immature, greedy brat.

148
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,560
She's just trying to hog all the men
from good families.

149
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
What?

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,600
She says she likes Jun Ho,
but she'll marry someone at Dream's level.

151
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,400
That's what makes her smart.
She has her fun dating one guy,

152
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,410
then marries another
from a wealthy family.

153
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,080
Darn it, then where does that leave me?

154
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,010
Wait, then our dream
of taking over Dream...

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,550
is just slipping further and further away,
isn't it?

156
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,820
If she marries a rich guy,
she'll obviously take over Dream.

157
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,460
Then why'd you serve a rich guy up to her
on a silver platter?

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,460
Why do you always ask for trouble?

159
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,330
How was I supposed to know
this would happen?

160
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,590
Just wait, Hong Ju.

161
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,270
I'll do whatever it takes
to get those profiles for you.

162
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,710
Oh my.

163
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,910
It's still chilly in here.

164
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,680
Is it?

165
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,790
Thank you. This is nice and warm.

166
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,260
I'm glad to hear that.

167
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,630
It's pretty old and worn out, though.

168
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,370
I like it.
It even smells like you, Professor.

169
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,310
Hwa Young, when did you get
to be so beautiful?

170
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,540
Isn't that a line from a drama?

171
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,550
I didn't know you used lines like that.

172
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,590
I'll do anything you like, Hwa Young.

173
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,260
That reminds me. About your son...

174
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,990
What?

175
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,360
Don't tell me she found out
Chef Kang Jun Ho is my son.

176
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,040
Okay, before Hwa Young says anything,
it'd be better if I came clean myself.

177
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,810
- My son, Jun...
- Your son, the lawyer.

178
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,870
So...

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,340
you mean my Baek Ho?

180
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,180
- Really? When did you meet my Baek Ho?
- No, I didn't exactly meet him.

181
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,950
I just happened to see him.

182
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,420
- I see.
- I could be wrong, but...

183
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
It's nothing.

184
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,390
What? You can't just stop in the middle
of a sentence and leave me hanging.

185
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,760
I feel like it's not my place to say.

186
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Especially since you cherished him...

187
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,730
and worked so hard to make him a lawyer.

188
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,870
Not at all. You can tell me anything.
It's fine, so please tell me.

189
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,670
I'm not sure if I should be the one
to say this,

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,740
it seems he's seeing a woman
who's bad news.

191
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,110
What? My Baek Ho?

192
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,150
Jang Mi really grew up surrounded by love.

193
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,920
Her mother sacrificed her own life
to save her,

194
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,360
and you raised her with so much love.

195
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,360
That's only natural for a father.
And didn't you tell Jang Mi before...

196
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,270
that Suk Hee gets anxious
when Jang Mi is out of sight...

197
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,770
is all because of her instinct
to protect her?

198
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,440
Her mind might have been affected
by the accident,

199
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,950
but that instinct to protect Jang Mi
must be etched into her subconscious.

200
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,820
Here you go, Mrs. Jung. Please eat.

201
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,990
Baek Ho, eat a lot. Baek Ho is so cool.

202
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,460
Suk Hee likes Baek Ho.

203
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,230
Thanks. I like you too.

204
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,970
All right, let's all dig in.

205
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes.

206
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,110
This soybean paste stew
is really delicious.

207
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,410
- My mom made the stew.
- Really?

208
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,880
This is a masterpiece!
It's absolutely delicious!

209
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,110
It's really the best! The best!

210
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,350
Suk Hee is so excited! This is great!
Kang Baek Ho, you're so cool!

211
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,520
Kang Baek Ho is so cool!

212
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,690
What?

213
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,070
I'm home.

214
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,770
Baek Ho. Come and sit down.

215
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,040
Why are you so serious, Dad?

216
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,850
You need to get married someday,

217
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,350
so why are you running around
with the wrong kind of woman?

218
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
What?

219
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,820
The wrong kind of woman?

220
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Who? Me?

221
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,130
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,160
Seriously, who told you
that I'm seeing the wrong kind of woman?

223
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,000
Who said it doesn't matter.

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,970
The problem is
that you're seeing someone like that.

225
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,800
I don't know any women like that.
This is weird.

226
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,340
I think you must have heard wrong.

227
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,970
Someone said they saw you
with a shady woman.

228
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,610
I was told I should keep my son in line.

229
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,280
- I'm so embarrassed.
- I can't believe how unfair this is.

230
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,550
No, that's not true.
I've never dated a woman like that.

231
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,820
Honey.

232
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,260
Our Baek Ho
isn't that kind of person, right?

233
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,460
Wait, is it that Oh Jang Mi woman?

234
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,800
So you've seen the woman
Baek Ho's been meeting.

235
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,800
Jun Ho, you know her too?

236
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,530
No.

237
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,040
No, Jang Mi isn't a woman like that.

238
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,370
This is ridiculous.

239
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,880
Who dares to talk about Jang Mi like that?

240
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,110
Bring whoever slandered her to me
right now.

241
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,790
Here you go.

242
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,160
She hid you in the villa's shed as a baby,
and then had that accident.

243
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,860
There must have been a reason...

244
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,830
something that left her
with no other choice, right?

245
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Mom.

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Thank you.

247
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,910
And I'm so sorry.

248
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,210
Jang Mi is pretty.

I love Jang Mi.

I love my mom too.

Mom, I love you...

255
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,330
so much.

256
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,010
Mom, you know, today...

257
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,450
I almost got crushed to death by a sign.

258
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,820
You know what? In that moment,
your face was the first thing on my mind.

259
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,850
I thought, "I can't die
and leave you all alone."

260
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,920
I was so scared.

261
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,280
When I draw near, you turn and run away

262
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,020
When I look at you, you gaze at the sky

263
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,990

or just pretend not to

264
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,260
Time just keeps on slipping by

265

Even when you brush right past me

266
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,800
And turn away, pretending not to see

267
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,770
My heart flows on like a river

268
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,340
Are you a rainbow drifting away?

269
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,240
I would run to you

270
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,350

Into my heart

273
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,790
I wouldn't run around like a child

or drift away chasing butterflies

275
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,130
I would stay by your side forever and ever

276

with the wrong kind of woman?

something like that?

Are you okay?

286
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,700
I heard you were almost killed
by a falling sign earlier.

287
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,870
Were you having a nightmare?

288
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,570
I must have dozed off.

289
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,470
In my dream,
the sign was falling on my head again.

290
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,380
You must've been really shaken up.

291
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,710
You're back already?

292
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,750
You should've stayed out longer
and had some fun to de-stress.

293
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,450

you never once let on
and treated me like a real sister.

It might be different if you were older,
but you came as a baby.

My mom and I share it.

350
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,550
I didn't come to be waited on.
I feel like I'm putting you out.

351
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,890
Not at all.

352
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm not sure if you'll like it,
but please, try it.

353
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
It's delicious.

354
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,730
I heard you were a good cook,

355
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,000
and you make excellent coffee.

356
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,670
I get it from my mom.
I inherited her knack for cooking.

357
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,540
I can tell.

358
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,410
Unfortunately,
I don't know how to tell you this.

359
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,580
- What?
- Chef Kang said he won't see you again.

360
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,250
Really?

361
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,920
I told him yesterday
that you'd be there by 2 p.m.,

362
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,090
so he waited for you.

363
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,060
But you've stood him up twice now.

364
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,930
Who would be happy about that?

365
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,400
- You're right.
- Besides, Chef Kang Jun Ho is rather...

366
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,870
No, I mean,
the man has no respect for authority.

367
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,740
He's so headstrong
that even though I'm the CEO,

368
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,780
he won't listen to a thing I say.

369
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,090
I told him that was unacceptable
and insisted he hire you,

370
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,860
but he's not having any of it.

371
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,430
He's so pig-headed
and absolutely refuses to budge.

372
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,660
What am I going to do?

373
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,870
I understand.

374
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,470
I feel terrible
for putting you through this.

375
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,540
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be.

376
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,340
The trouble I went through...

377
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,210
is nothing
compared to your disappointment.

378
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
I will...

379
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,280
find you a job at a place
better than Chang Restaurant,

380
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,590
so just forget about that place.

381
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,590
It breaks my heart
to see you so disappointed.

382
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,760
Thank you, but I feel I've already
imposed on you so much.

383
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,430
You really don't have to worry
about me anymore.

384
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Jang Mi.

385
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Could you get me a glass of water?
My throat is suddenly parched.

386
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,670
Of course. Just a moment.

387
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,190
- Here.
- Thanks.

388
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
Who is it?

389
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,060
Oh my goodness, what was that sound?

390
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,700
- Sounds like there's trouble outside.
- Just a second.

391
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,170
Where is it?

392
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,110
Where did she put my mother's keepsake?

393
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,350
Jang Mi, it isn't something
you should have.

394
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,850
It's mine.

395
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,450
Oh no.

396
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Are you okay, Bo Ra?

397
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,960
The window broke. A bad person did it.

398
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Our Bo Ra is crying. Suk Hee is scared.

399
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,030
The window broke. A bad person did it.
Our Bo Ra is crying.

400
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,400
- Suk Hee is scared.
- It's okay, Bo Ra.

401
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,740
- You're scared.
- The window broke.

402
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,310
- Tae Sook, what happened?
- I'm scared.

403
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,240
Someone threw a rock from outside.

404
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,680
What? A rock?

405
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,810
Who would do such a thing?

406
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,450
I don't know.
Dad ran out to catch whoever did it.

407
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,680
I can't tell if it was on purpose
or just some neighborhood kids.

408
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,050
How could something like this happen?

409
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,660
It's not here?

410
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,800
If it's not here,

411
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,770
then where on earth could it be?

412
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,050
It's okay.

413
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,820
Hey, Tae Sook, wait!

414
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,250
Leave that alone.
We need a picture for the police report.

415
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,860
Just like that.

416
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,280
Found it.

417
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,970
(The First Man)

418
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,280
What do you mean, leukemia?

419
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,650
I heard that one of our children was
diagnosed with leukemia.

420
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,250
So where is Ha Neul now? Tell me.

421
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,820
I hear the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals
likes to jog along the Han River.

422
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,760
Oh my goodness, he's gorgeous.

423
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,130
Are you all right?

424
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,230
What happened? Did anyone see who did it?

425
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,360
This lady is bad!
She stole Jang Mi's hairpin.

426
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,000
She's a thief.
