00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,090
Gosh, you're kicking up so much dust.
Go do that inside.

7
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,330
Come on. I'm about to go grocery shopping.

8
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,800
I can't go until Jang Mi gets here.
She knows what to get.

9
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,000
But speaking of Jang Mi,
has she mentioned anything?

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,640
- About what?
- Doesn't she ever ask who her dad is?

11
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,140
Hey, how come you two
are coming in together?

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,110
We went to the police station
and found out who took down our banner.

13
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,680
Really? Who is it?

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,480
- This is the guy.
- Let me see.

15
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,820
- Gosh, this guy looks like bad news.
- He was an enforcer for the Viper Gang.

16
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,990
Apparently, the gang disbanded,
and the members all scattered.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,160
So you're saying this is the guy
who tried to harm Suk Hee?

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,260
We're not sure. But if we catch this man,

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,870
we'll finally solve the mystery
of what happened to my mom.

20
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,640
Catching him has to be
our top priority, then.

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,970
But even after that,

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,840
someone kept stopping you
from putting the banner back up, right?

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,280
That's right. Even the county office...

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,250
didn’t let us hang it when we applied
for a banner permit.

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,050
That means there's someone powerful...

26
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,890
backing him up.

27
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,160
Yes, that could be it.

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,260
Someone who can control the Viper Gang
or people like them.

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,630
A powerful person has to be involved.

(Public Release of Suspect Information,

31
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,550
Where did Mrs. Yeom go?

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,180
She's in her room.

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,570
I'm coming in.

34
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,710
Mrs. Yeom.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Are you crying?

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,990
Are you crying?

37
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm a woman too, you know.

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,820
After being humiliated like that by you,

39
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,090
how can I ever show my face again?

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,130
I'm so mortified someone will find out.

41
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,340
- Mrs. Yeom.
- I don't even want to live anymore.

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,840
I've lived my life
completely devoted to you.

43
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,350
Look, I...

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,350
I didn't really mean it.

45
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,820
But after you rejected me so cruelly,

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,820
I just wonder
what the point of living is...

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,660
in this world full of sorrow.

48
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,400
It really hurt you that much.
I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Chairman.
Why did you push me away so forcefully?

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
Oh, for goodness' sake.

51
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,310
As you know, Mrs. Yeom,

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,410
it's been a long time
since I've had a woman by my side.

53
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,750
I've been a bachelor for so long,
so I just panicked.

54
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,320
So that means...

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,560
you don't find me repulsive, right?

56
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,090
Goodness. Repulsive? Of course not.

57
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,260
It's not lonely at all having you here.
In fact, I like it.

58
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,430
Chairman.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,770
You hold my very life
in your hands, Chairman.

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,940
My very life is in your hands.

61
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,110
Gosh, you're always so dramatic.

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,920
What a sly fox.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,450
I wonder what tricks she's pulling
to wrap the Chairman around her finger.

64
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,720
We're both in the same boat,
just servants waiting on our master.

65
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,700
If she thinks she can run this house
and start ordering me around,

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,200
she'll have another thing coming.

67
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,270
Mrs. Yang.

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,670
The Chairman and I are going out,
so clean his room until it's spotless.

69
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,480
And make that spicy croaker stew
the Chairman likes.

70
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,450
- No, I was thinking we could eat out.
- Let's go, Chairman.

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,620
- Have a good time, Chairman.
- Carry on.

72
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,790
Gosh, as soon as I said that,
she's ordering me around.

73
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,400
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,700
What? The witness isn't picking up?

75
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,170
That's weird.
I still can't get a hold of him.

76
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,070
But he was so willing to cooperate.

77
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,110
Someone must have gotten to him first.

78
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,480
You're right.
The power behind this must have acted.

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,810
That means someone knows our every move.

80
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,920
Did you notice anyone suspicious around?

81
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
By the way, Jang Mi.

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,860
This is completely unrelated, though.

83
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,390
Yes?

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,470
And I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,570
No, never mind.
I can't tell you. Just forget it.

86
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
- What is it?
- Anyway,

87
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,910
- I need to think about it more.
- About what?

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
It's nothing.

89
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,810
- Goodness.
- What? You're still here?

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,850
Do you want to get cozy
and peel some potatoes?

91
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,750
- Me?
- Jang Mi.

92
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,120
Let's talk for a minute.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,560
Jang Mi, you're going to get hurt
if you keep dealing with thugs like this.

94
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
Please stop.
It would kill me if you got hurt.

95
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,570
Dad, why would I get hurt?

96
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,800
I'll be fine, so don't worry.

97
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,040
Why won't you ever listen to me?

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,210
I'll find the people who did this
to your mom,

99
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,810
so you just go study abroad.

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,940
What happened to Mom concerns me too.

101
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,380
So don't even try to talk me out of it.
All right? I've already made up my mind.

102
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,590
So you're going to give up studying abroad
and settle for this?

103
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,320
This kind of opportunity
doesn't come around every day.

104
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,290
Do you think you can just go
whenever you feel like it?

105
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm sorry, Dad.

106
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
What?

107
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,570
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview Jang Mi?

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,640
Gosh, looks like Jang Mi
is finally getting her wish.

109
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,110
Hey, but how do you know that chef?

110
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,040
The thing is...

111
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,920
He's my brother. My actual brother.

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,650
What? Hey! Why have you been hiding that
this whole time?

113
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,220
I wasn't hiding it. It just never came up.

114
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,790
Please don't tell Jang Mi
that he's my brother.

115
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,990
You're something else.

116
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,760
You tell Jang Mi about
the interview yourself.

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,530
Come on, you do it.

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,870
And also,

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,570
speaking of which...

120
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,740
The one who injured Jang Mi's hand...

121
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,310
was me.

122
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,710
What was that?

123
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,210
Come here, honey.

124
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,130
What do you think you're doing?

125
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,400
Sorry.

126
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,970
You're the one who hurt Jang Mi's hand?

127
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,500
Get over here! Come here, you punk!

128
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,000
- I'm sorry, Tae Pyung!
- You punk!

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,140
What else haven't you told me? Anything?

130
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,310
Let me go!

131
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,610
Let's try drawing it in blue.

132
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
What?

133
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,280
You want me to go where?

134
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,420
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview you.

135
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,620
- Me? For real?
- That's right.

136
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,060
Take your resume to Chang Restaurant
by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

137
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,760
Gosh! You're not kidding, right?

138
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,560
So the great Chef Kang Jun Ho himself
said he wants to see me?

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,900
Yes, you dork. Are you that happy?

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,700
Of course I'm happy.

141
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,870
He was my first love.

142
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,940
He's the best guy ever,

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,570
and he's the chef I admire and look up to
more than anyone.

144
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,510
I'm glad. I'm so relieved
you'll finally be able to work there.

145
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,280
- But how do you know Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- What?

146
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,790
It's not so much that I know him, but...

147
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,130
How did you find out about it to tell me?

148
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,700
Gosh, you drew that so well. Is it a pig?

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,000
It's a bunny. Suk Hee is good at drawing.
I like Baek Ho.

150
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,710
Oh, my! So it was CEO Chae.

151
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,540
- What?
- CEO Chae Hwa Young told you, didn't she?

152
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,850
That must be it. She knows
that my dream is to be a chef.

153
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,880
So that's why she told
Chef Kang Jun Ho about me.

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,790
Yes, that's right. It was CEO Chae.

155
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,920
I can't thank her enough.
How can I ever repay her?

156
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,030
I can't believe someone like her exists.

157
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,890
She got you a gig,

158
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,460
and when I turned down the offer
to study abroad,

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,560
she even got me a job at the restaurant.

160
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
Goodness.

161
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,170
She sounds like an amazing person.

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
Right. Tell me about it.

163
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,370
You should go to the interview tomorrow.

164
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,440
I have to repay CEO Chae's kindness.

165
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,440
Tae Pyung, to show her how grateful I am,

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,050
I'm going to work incredibly hard
if I get a job there.

167
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,880
Thank you so much, Tae Pyung.

168
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,150
Sure.

169
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,750
Goodness.

budget proposal for next month...

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,740
Do it again.

174
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,140
- Pardon? What kind of problem?
- The budgets for the wedding hall...

175
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,110
and other Food and Beverage outlets
are the same,

176
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,210
so why was
only Chang Restaurant's budget increased?

177
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,110
- That's...
- Didn't you hear me?

178
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,210
I said, cut the budget drastically.

179
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,020
The way Chef Kang Jun Ho
recklessly spends money on ingredients.

180
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,150
Don't you think it's time
we finally reined that in?

181
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,790
But that would be a huge blow
to Chang Restaurant's image.

182
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,100
We need to use fresh, high-end ingredients
to maintain its luxury image.

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,970
Who couldn't make delicious food
by throwing that much money around?

184
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,700
A "luxury image?"

185
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,970
A skilled chef can make
any food luxurious, no matter the cost.

186
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,040
That's what real skill is.

187
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,580
Spending money like water
just because it isn't his.

188
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,350
Why are you just standing there?

189
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,850
Get out and draw up
a proper budget right now.

190
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,320
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,920
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

192
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,100
Tell Chef Kang Jun Ho
to come to my office.

193
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,650
Were you the one who proposed
a budget increase to Team Leader Jin?

194
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,150
Yes.

195
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,450
Excuse me?

196
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,750
And you expect to be a chef,
spending money like that?

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,390
Are you aware that's a dead giveaway
of your lack of skill?

198
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,630
I take it you intend to cut the budget,

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,300
but I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain
from the offensive personal attacks.

200
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,030
I meant for them to be offensive.

201
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,000
And while we're at it,
there's one more thing.

202
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,870
You're trying to seduce my Seo Rin,

203
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,380
scheming to get your foot
in the door at Dream.

204
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,350
But I swear, over my dead body,

205
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,550
will you and Seo Rin ever be together.
You'd better understand that.

206
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,990
Don't you dare take my words lightly.
Mark them well.

207
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,430
Are you that threatened?

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
What?

209
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,700
I believe I've already said...

210
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
I have no feelings for your daughter.

211
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,940
But are you...

212
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,410
worried that something might happen
between me and Director Ma Seo Rin?

213
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,610
- Is that why you're so terrified?
- Watch your mouth.

214
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,250
If you continue to act this despicably,

215
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,410
then I might just have to...

216
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,350
- start pursuing Director Ma Seo Rin.
- Kang Jun Ho.

217
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes, CEO Chae?

218
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,460
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

219
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,730
- I'll think about it.
- I've given you a clear warning.

220
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,310
What gives him the right
to be so arrogant?

221
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,490
Jun Ho, where have you been?

222
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,930
Jun Ho, you heard, didn't you?

223
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,460
- About coming to my house this weekend.
- I have no reason to go,

224
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,260
- so just drop it.
- Why?

225
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,070
You've got it wrong.
I wasn't the one who invited you.

226
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,270
Jin Hong Ju bugged my grandfather
until he invited you.

227
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,510
- It was Team Leader Jin who invited you.
- I don't care who invited me.

228
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,850
I'm not going.

229
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,080
But my grandfather's the one
who invited you.

230
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,350
You're going to turn him down?

231
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,510
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

232
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,040
Ha Neul.

233
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,700
My son.

234
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,140
Where are you?

235
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,210
When your mom is having such a hard time,

236
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,120
I wish you were here by my side
to give me strength.

237
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,650
My son.

238
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,360
Stop crying.

239
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,130
What can I do?
We don't have any money, sweetie.

240
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,670
We don't even have money for formula.

241
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,210
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Hwa Young.

242
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,580
Where are you?

243
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,350
- Why have you been so hard to reach?
- I'm sorry.

244
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,650
I haven't been feeling well,

245
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,580
so I came out to the countryside
to rest up for a bit.

246
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,920
Could you lend me some money?
I'm completely broke.

247
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,290
Chae Hwa Young, you're saved.

248
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,130
An offer came in for a soda commercial.

249
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,630
If you shoot this ad,

250
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,530
- it's your ticket to stardom.
- What?

251
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,440
The shoot is next Monday,

252
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,210
so just get up here as fast as you can.

253
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
Got it?

254
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,720
- All right, I'm taking the picture.
- Okay.

255
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,620
Stay still.

256
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,760
That's right.
If I just shoot this soda commercial,

257
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,730
I can become a breakout star.

258
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,400
My struggles will finally be over,

259
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,000
but I can't let anything hold me back.

260
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,470
Once I make money,

261
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,210
my baby,

262
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,440
I'll come back for you then.

263
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,950
Just wait a little longer.

264
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,450
What a handsome baby.

265
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,220
What's his name?

266
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,490
Ha Neul.

267
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,900
It's Ha Neul.

268
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,930
Ha Neul, look over here.

269
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

270
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,110
Ha Neul, look over here.
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

271
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,010
Do you want me to get
a shot of you two together?

272
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,220
No, just make sure
you get a good one of Ha Neul.

273
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,550
Sure.

274
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,550
Ha Neul, look here.

275
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,890
Ha Neul, look over here.
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

277
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,590
Maybe I shouldn't have told
Jang Mi about my brother.

278
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,560
It's obvious she's going to get
the job at the restaurant.

279
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,560
- Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- Yes.

280
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,860
Even the way he walked was so cool.

281
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,830
He was just like a model.

282
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,900
A model? Not even remotely.

283
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,710
He's more like
a cold, bitter iced Americano.

284
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,010
Then again,
iced Americanos are seriously addictive.

285
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,780
I shouldn't have said anything.

286
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,490
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

287
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,890
Jang Mi, it's me, Kang Baek Ho.

288
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Cheers.

289
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,370
How can you be in the mood for a toast
at a time like this?

290
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,570
The detective said Ssangkal vanished
and has no idea where he is.

291
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,640
But there's nothing we can do about that.

292
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,670
There's no concrete evidence...

293
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,240
Ssangkal was the one
who took down the banner,

294
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,810
so the police can't even issue an APB.

295
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,710
But does that mean
we can't even make a toast?

296
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,150
Especially when you're about to get
your dream job at that restaurant?

297
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,920
What does that have to do
with catching the culprit?

298
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,690
They're not related,

299
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,860
but achieving your dream is something
worth celebrating.

300
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,630
You're not going to drink?

301
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,270
No, thanks. You go ahead
and drink up, Lawyer Kang.

302
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,440
Always with the "lawyer."

303
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,370
It's really starting to get on my nerves.

304
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,710
My name is Kang Baek Ho.
You could call me Baek Ho or something.

305
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,680
Kang Baek Ho or Baek Ho.

306
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,280
Or "brother."

307
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,310
Right. "Brother" sounds nice.

308
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,080
Come on, try calling me something else.

309
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,560
We're not advertising that I'm a lawyer.
Everyone around here thinks it's weird.

310
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,560
All right.

311
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,090
Baek Ho...

312
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,230
Brother Baek Ho.

313
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,070
I like the sound of that.

314
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,510
Maybe because I have no younger sister,
I really like hearing it.

315
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,780
But are you sure you won't have any?
You've got to drink to build a tolerance.

316
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,490
I have an important interview tomorrow,
so I'd better not.

317
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,260
If I drink, my face might get puffy.

318
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,530
She'd be pretty even if it was.

319
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,630
You think one drink will make you
fail your interview?

320
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,430
Don't worry.

321
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,200
Your interview is
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, right?

322
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,770
I'll be rooting for you.

323
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,770
Your dream.

324
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,910
I truly hope you achieve it.

325
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,880
Of all the things you've said to me,

326
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,150
that's the nicest thing I've heard yet.

327
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm heading to bed.

328
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,100
- I'm home.
- You're back?

329
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,170
You're home, son?

330
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,970
Hey, Jun Ho.

331
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,140
Jun Ho, I'm sorry.

332
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,350
Rumor has it
that the famous Chef Kang Jun Ho...

333
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,920
is madly in love with his girlfriend.

334
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,660
- Really?
- Yes.

335
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,400
I hear they're getting married soon.

336
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,570
So, there's no need to get your hopes up
over Chef Kang Jun Ho.

337
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,440
What? You're ridiculous.

338
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,970
Did you think Chef Kang
would not have a girlfriend?

339
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,680
Is that why you're sharing this?

340
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,640
And here I thought it was
something serious.

341
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
Unbelievable.

342
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,880
I made up a girlfriend
you don't even have, Jun Ho,

343
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
and it didn't even faze her.

344
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,050
Why are you staring at me like that?

345
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,120
Nothing.

346
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,090
Jang Mi has an interview tomorrow
at 10 a.m.

347
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,360
Go easy on her, will you?

348
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,860
What? That's lame.

349
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,100
Is her name Jang Mi?

350
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,300
Yes, it's Oh Jang Mi.
Even her name is pretty, right?

351
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,040
Do you like her?

352
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
No.

353
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
What? That's lame.

354
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,050
Yes.

355
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,650
I think I do like her.

356
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,790
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

357
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,490
Should I wear it down?

358
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,970
The groundskeeper at the villa
said this was on the ground.

359
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,180
He gave me this hairpin
and asked if it was your mom's.

360
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,720
My mom's?

361
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,560
The Suk Hee I knew
was never one for jewelry.

362
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,330
But then again, there must be a lot
about her that I never knew.

363
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,840
Maybe it was from your birth father,
so I kept it safe.

364
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,390
Goodness!

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,360
Jang Mi, you're so pretty.
My pretty Jang Mi.

366
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,240
- I get my looks from you, Mom.
- Jang Mi is Suk Hee's daughter.

367
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,300
Jang Mi is so pretty.

368
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,610
Oh, right. Mom.

369
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,180
Do you remember this hairpin?

370
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,550
Do you happen to remember
who gave it to you?

371
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,520
Suk Hee doesn't know.

372
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,520
Maybe if you try it on...

373
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,490
No, I don't want it! It's not Suk Hee's.

374
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,820
Suk Hee hates it!

375
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,460
- This is yours, Mom.
- No! It's not Suk Hee's.

376
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,800
This is Suk Hee's. This one.

377
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,810
What?

378
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,650
Oh Jang Mi
is going to have her interview...

379
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,150
with Chef Kang Jun Ho at Chang Restaurant?

380
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,680
- Yes.
- Did you just say "yes"?

381
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,920
How can you just stand there
like an idiot and say "yes"?

382
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,760
I just found out myself.
I wanted to report it to you first.

383
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,330
- I'll take care of it immediately.
- Use your head! Think for one second!

384
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,730
Just imagine Chef Kang Jun Ho
meeting Oh Jang Mi.

385
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,230
She's a dead ringer for Seo Rin!

386
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,500
On top of that,
what if Seo Rin and Oh Jang Mi meet?

387
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,440
What are we going to do
if those twins meet?

388
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,910
And that's not all.

389
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,380
Imagine if Father sees Seo Rin
and Oh Jang Mi at the same time.

390
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,820
It's a nightmare just thinking about it.

391
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,820
What am I going to do?

392
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,750
It's only a matter of time...

393
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,190
before everyone finds out I stole a twin.

394
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,740
The interview is at 10 a.m.

395
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,980
She might have arrived already.

396
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,520
Should I go and try to stop her now?

397
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,390
After all I did to keep her away
from this company...

398
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,120
Are you just going to stand by
and do nothing?

399
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,230
You have to do something to stop this.

400
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,490
No. I have to stop this now.

401
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,150
Okay, Oh Jang Mi. Just be yourself.

402
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't go overboard
just because it's Chef Kang Jun Ho.

403
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,640
(The First Man)

404
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,110
What kind of amazing woman
has the great Kang Baek Ho so whipped?

405
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,920
I should at least meet her before I judge.

406
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,320
Today is the day
Chef Kang Jun Ho is coming to the house.

407
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,860
I was just worried that Director Ma
might cause trouble.

408
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,360
I wonder if something's wrong.

409
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,230
- Did something happen to Assistant Chae?
- Gosh, you scared me!

410
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,400
I thought your assistant's name
was Kim Hyo Jung.

411
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,970
