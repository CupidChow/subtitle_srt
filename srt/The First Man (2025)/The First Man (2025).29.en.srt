00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(Episode 29)

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,780
It's a pleasure to meet you.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,480
I've heard so much about you.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,490
You're even more beautiful in person.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,670
Can I be honest with you?

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,370
Yes, of course.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,210
I'm in love with someone else.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,810
I haven't won him over yet,
but I'm not going to give up.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,880
Actually,
I have feelings for someone, too.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,090
I always thought love and marriage
could be two different things,

11
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,290
but I guess you don't see it that way.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,660
I'm just not the type to lie.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,370
I got dumped
before we even had a chance to eat.

14
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,210
What are you doing? Aren't you coming?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Pardon?

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,580
Aren't we going to eat?

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,490
Are you all right, ma'am?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,760
Should I call an ambulance?

19
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,270
His name is Kim Young Ho.

20
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,000
He was five
when he was diagnosed with leukemia.

21
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,680
Search every hospital
specializing in rare childhood diseases.

22
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,210
You have to find my Ha Neul.

23
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,680
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,050
My Ha Neul is not dead.
You must find him. Understood?

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,460
My baby.

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,900
My son...

27
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,000
There's no way...

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,500
my son could've died so easily
from leukemia.

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,810
Please...

30
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,240
Please, just be alive, my son.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,880
Mommy can do anything for you now.

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,980
Anything...

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,220
My son.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,990
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

35
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,700
What's wrong?

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,530
You don't need to know.

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,100
- Tell me.
- I said you don't need to know.

38
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,610
Stay out of it.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,640
Is this about Professor Kang?

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,980
I told you to stop meddling.

41
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,370
I'm Kang Jun Ho, the head chef.

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,800
You were looking for me?

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,340
Jun Ho.

44
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,940
What dish does the chef recommend today?

45
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,320
How about I make
my special recommendation for you?

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,150
Yes, please, Jun Ho.
I'll be looking forward to it.

47
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,490
Why are you still standing here?

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,130
If you have something to say,
just spit it out.

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,000
Director Ma Seo Rin is on a blind date
at Chang Restaurant right now.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,470
I thought you should be made aware.

51
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,870
All right. You may go.

52
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,710
What is it, Hwa Young?

53
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,380
- What?
- I have a right to know.

54
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,850
Did something happen?

55
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,490
Why are you crying? Tell me.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,460
It's because of that
punk Professor Kang, isn't it?

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,190
Shut up!

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,760
I told you not to cross the line,
didn't I?

59
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,300
This is none of your business, so get out.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,330
Is there something going on with you
that I don't know about?

61
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
If you don't tell me what's going on,

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,440
I might just have to deal
with Professor Kang myself.

63
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,040
It's not because of Professor Kang.
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,680
- Really?
- Yes. Please...

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,580
I'm going through so much right now,

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,790
so please...

67
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,120
don't you start too.

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,420
That's exactly why...

69
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,260
I need to know what you're going through.

70
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,060
You're exhausting me.

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,100
Please just go and do your job.

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,310
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

73
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll wait until you're ready to tell me.

74
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,390
You shouldn't keep secrets from me.

75
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Get out.

76
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

77
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,660
Norwegian trout,
seasoned with low-temp aged truffle salt,

78
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,560
harmonized with thinly sliced apple,
balsamic syrup, and white wine.

79
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,700
The combination will give
a deep, rich flavor. Please enjoy.

80
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,870
Delicious.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,410
Of course it is.

82
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,610
You're every bit as good as they say.

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,980
The first bite should be refreshing,
the second, unexpected,

84
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,080
but the last must be memorable.

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,420
It's just like how a blind date should be.

86
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
A little something special
from the chef for the occasion.

87
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,820
I hope you have a wonderful time.

88
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,100
I don't think that guy
is interested in you.

89
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,970
He knows this is our blind date,

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,440
and he serves a dish
that's meant to be memorable?

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,440
That's part of his charm.

92
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,680
If Jun Ho is a man,

93
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,750
won't he get jealous
seeing me on a blind date?

94
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,220
Please be jealous, Jun Ho!

95
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,690
I'm home.

96
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,250
My sweet girl.

97
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,690
How's your injury?

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,230
I'm fine now.

99
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,930
Listen, Seo Rin went
on a blind date today.

100
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,230
If you haven't met
the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals yet,

101
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,340
you should meet the guy Seo Rin saw today.

102
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,540
You want me to take her leftovers?

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
- No way.
- Gosh, how could you...

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,220
Hong Ju.
Here, try this on and see if it fits.

105
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,390
You need to wear something like this...

106
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,960
to catch the youngest son
of Jinan Chemicals' eye.

107
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,430
Mom, I'm not meeting
the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals.

108
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,430
What? Why not?

109
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,500
Because...

110
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,170
I've met the man of my dreams.

111
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,810
The man of your dreams?

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,710
And who on earth would that be?

113
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,610
Just someone.

114
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,080
A man who was glowing
in the morning sunlight.

115
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,850
You just happened to meet him?

116
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,820
Listen to yourself.

117
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,660
You have to win over
the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals.

118
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,260
That's our only way to survive.

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,030
Do I have to marry a rich guy?

120
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,060
The guy I ran into is a lawyer.

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,500
For people like us,
a lawyer is good enough.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,930
You naive girl!

123
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,170
Do you think all lawyers are the same?

124
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,740
These days, even lawyers are struggling
and unable to pay their office rent.

125
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,680
They end up getting evicted
and going broke.

126
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,510
What's the point of being a lawyer
in name only?

127
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm going to find out
if he's a starving lawyer or not.

128
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,750
I'm risking everything for him.

129
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,020
So you'd better get used to it.

130
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,590
Good grief, Hong Ju!

131
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,630
She drives me crazy!

(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

133
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,870
You're saying Suk Hee was that rude
to CEO Chae?

134
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes.

135
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,540
After everything CEO Chae has done for us,

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,570
she must have left in a terrible mood
that day.

137
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,610
She accused an innocent person of theft.

138
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,970
I'd be upset too if I were her.

139
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,180
Right, Dad? What should we do?

140
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,980
What's worse is that CEO Chae
is trying to help both you...

141
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,080
and your brother.

142
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,680
To be so rude to someone
who's helped so much.

143
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,290
I should probably go apologize
to CEO Chae with my mom, right?

144
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,890
Yes, you absolutely should.

145
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,060
- Let's pack some of these side dishes...
- No, Dad.

146
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,270
Last time, she said she disliked the smell
of side dishes in the hotel.

147
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,970
Oh, right. Then what would be a good gift?

148
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,910
I think just going with Mom
to apologize in person...

149
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,070
would be more meaningful.

150
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,240
(Child Welfare Card, Kim Young Ho)

151
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,410
Is it possible that this child...

152
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,280
isn't my Ha Neul,

153
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,820
and you mixed up his record
with another child's?

154
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,950
Are you sure this is my Ha Neul?

155
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Ma'am, you said he had three moles
in a row on the back of his neck, right?

156
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,890
You also said that his date of birth
was May 29, 1990.

157
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,800
Yes.

158
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,500
Then this is him.

159
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,130
No. It can't be.

160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,340
My Ha Neul isn't dead.

161
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,670
Please check again.
There has to be a mistake.

162
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,180
I remember it clearly.

163
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,480
Because the three moles on his neck
are so distinctive,

164
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,980
I said he'd have no trouble
finding his parents someday.

165
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,850
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- It's not him!

166
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,960
My son does have three moles
on his neck, but...

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,060
I know this is hard to believe,

168
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,130
but I'm afraid your son has passed away.

169
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,260
What do you mean?

170
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Look here!

171
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,330
It doesn't even say he's deceased.

172
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,400
Director, did you see my son pass away
with your own eyes?

173
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,210
You didn't, did you?

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
No.

175
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,580
No, I didn't, but...

176
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
If you didn't see him,

177
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,950
then don't jinx it by saying he's dead,
and look into it again.

178
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
I'll pay you whatever it takes.
Just find him.

179
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,490
I know he's alive.

(Happy Children's Home)

182
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,540
What's going on?

183
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,970
Who on earth is Hwa Young looking for?

184
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,680
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

185
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,720
She looked so devastated.
Who could she possibly be looking for?

186
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,500
- Thank you.
- Take care.

187
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Take care.

188
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,230
Wait, someone broke the window
by throwing a rock?

189
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,000
- But who would do that?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

190
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,300
Didn't you call the police?

191
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,370
Of course we did.

192
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,010
They said they'd investigate,
but we haven't heard a peep.

193
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,010
Besides, no one was hurt,

194
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,410
so why would the police care
about a broken window?

195
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,350
This is all so weird.

196
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,350
Dangerous things have been happening
around Jang Mi lately.

197
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,290
You sound just like my sister.

198
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,630
- She said she had a bad feeling.
- Something's definitely fishy.

199
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,090
So, where is Jang Mi anyway?

200
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,130
- Is she in her room?
- No, Jang Mi and my mom...

201
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,970
- went to see CEO Chae.
- CEO Chae? Why?

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,740
Hey, don't even get me started. My mom...

203
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,170
Hey. Something came up.

204
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,610
We owe CEO Chae a lot, you know.

205
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,080
Jang Mi wanted to treat her to a meal...

206
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,550
as a way to thank her,

207
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,650
so she and Suk Hee went
to Chang Restaurant.

208
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,080
- Chang Restaurant?
- Yes.

209
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,500
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

210
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Ha Neul.

211
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,240
Mommy will find you.

212
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,510
Don't you worry. I'll find you.

213
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,660
I'll find you no matter what. I swear it.

214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
The person you're calling is unavailable.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
- Connecting to voicemail...
- She's not picking up.

216
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,550
How did it go? Did you find anything?

217
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,790
I confirmed the hospital and doctor listed
in the Happy Children's Home's records,

218
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,030
but I couldn't access the medical records.

219
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,960
- What? Is that your whole report?
- Just hear me out, ma'am.

220
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,270
Please be patient.

221
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,440
So, I checked with
the association instead.

222
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
The association?

223
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,010
You mean the one
for children with incurable diseases?

224
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Of course.

225
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,440
Going through the association...

226
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,610
would be faster
than searching every single hospital.

227
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,580
So what did you find out about my Ha Neul?

228
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,320
He had acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

229
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,360
I confirmed that he received treatment
for ALL.

230
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,420
If he received treatment,

231
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,490
does that mean he's alive?

232
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,130
I'd say there is a 50 percent chance.

233
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,730
But since I couldn't find
a death certificate,

234
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm almost certain
your son is still alive.

235
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Really?

236
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
He's alive, isn't he?

237
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,540
Thank you.

238
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,010
Thank you so much.

239
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,280

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,740
CEO Chae, I know my mother
caused you a lot of trouble,

242
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,170
so I wanted to apologize
and also thank you for everything.

243
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,410
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

244
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,950
My mom and I are on our way
to the hotel now.

245
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,980
I was wondering if you'd be free
for lunch at Chang Restaurant?

246
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,420
Oh Jang Mi is coming here again?

247
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,620
Even after I specifically told her
not to come?

248
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,430
What is wrong with her? Seriously!

249
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,330
The person you are calling
is unavailable...

250
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,100
Why isn't she picking up? Why?

251
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,740
This is driving me crazy.

252
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,190
Mom, you have to give her
a sincere apology.

253
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,660
Okay.

254
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,990
Let's go.

255
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,140
Jang Mi's tummy hurts.
She has to go to the bathroom.

256
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,640
Jang Mi's tummy hurts.

257
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,210
Gosh, Mom. You shock me every time.
You know me way too well.

258
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,750
Mom, can we stop by the restroom first?

259
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,680
Suk Hee will go to the restroom
with Jang Mi.

260
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,320
The restroom...

261
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,250
Darn it. Where are they?

262
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,690
What?

263
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh my gosh.

264
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,410
Hi, CEO Chae.

265
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,680
You didn't pick up, so I left a message.
Did you get it?

266
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,020
Jang Mi, where are you right now?
Where are you?

267
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,850
I urgently had to take care of business,
so I'm in the hotel restroom.

268
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,020
What? The restroom?

269
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,990
Suk Hee will wash her hands.

270
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,070
Suk Hee will wash her hands.

271
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
What?

272
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,570
You're not Jang Mi.

273
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,770
You're pretending to be Jang Mi.

274
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,780
- You're not Jang Mi.
- What's with this woman?

275
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,340
Get your wet hands off me!

276
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,110
Mom, just a second.

277
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,410
I'm so sorry.

278
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,780
This is strange.

279
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,320
It's Tok Hee.

280
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
This is strange...

281
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,160
Is the hotel letting anyone in now?
How irritating.

282
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,230
I'm so sorry. My mother is unwell.
I really apologize.

283
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,870
CEO Chae, my mom and I
came to treat you to a meal...

284
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,070
at Chang Restaurant.

285
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,740
I'm a very busy person.
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,240
I specifically told you not to come here.

287
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,010
You can't just show up
without an appointment.

288
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,350
I don't have time to eat. Leave right now.

289
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,520
Besides, Chef Kang Jun Ho isn't even here.
He's at an external event.

290
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,090
Do I make myself clear?

291
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Mom.

292
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I need to talk urgently. Come with me.

293
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,060
What is it?

294
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
This is strange...

295
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,140
Looks like CEO Chae is really busy.

296
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,740
What am I going to do, Mom?
I made her so mad.

297
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,710
She is pretending to be Jang Mi.
There are two Jang Mis.

298
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,250
What?

299
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,410
She is pretending to be Jang Mi.
There are two Jang Mis.

300
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,480
Jang Mi is right here.

301
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,520
Jang Mi is pretty.

302
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,920
Mom, what are you talking about?

303
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,730
One plus one is two.

304
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,600
Two Oh Jang Mis,

305
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,770
but one isn't Jang Mi.

306
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,100
Two Jang Mis.

307
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,340
It's Tok Hee.

308
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,170
Tok Hee is hurt.

309
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,410
Mom. What are you saying?

310
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
No...

311
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,920
It's okay.

312
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,060
What's wrong? It's okay.

313
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,200
Mom, what's wrong?

314
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,900
She didn't run into Oh Jang Mi, did she?

315
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,810
By the way, who was that woman?

316
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,540
- What woman?
- The one you were on the phone with.

317
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,450
- What?
- Why are you so shocked?

318
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,880
I think I heard her on the phone,
saying "CEO Chae" and whatnot.

319
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,920
If she'd run into Oh Jang Mi,
she wouldn't be this calm.

320
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,850
That's none of your concern.

321
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Then you shouldn't have
made it my concern.

322
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,630
What's that supposed to mean?

323
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,530
This strange lady
I ran into in the restroom grabbed me...

324
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,430
and accused me
of impersonating some Jang Mi.

325
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,170
Since when does our hotel let
just anyone wander in?

326
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,740
She met Jung Suk Hee?

327
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,240
Jung Suk Hee is your real mother.

328
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
Your birth mother.

329
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,010
Mom?

330
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,910
Why are you looking at me like that?

331
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,780
Why did you drag me out of there
in such a hurry?

332
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,650
I heard you had your blind date
at Chang Restaurant.

333
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,990
Tell me how it went. I'm dying to know.

334
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,900
You dragged me all this way for this?

335
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,460
Well, I'm curious. So, how was he?

336
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,870
What do I know about
what kind of guy he is?

337
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,240
And who's Jang Mi?

338
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,340
She said I was impersonating
someone named Jang Mi.

339
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,040
Is Jang Mi the woman
you were on the phone with?

340
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,610
Jang Mi?

341
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,950
I wouldn't know about that.

342
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,080
But it has nothing to do with you,
so you don't need to know.

343
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,320
Whatever.

344
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,630
Thank Goodness.
She didn't run into Oh Jang Mi.

345
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,330
Oh Jang Mi...

346
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,030
I need to get rid of her immediately.
She's driving me crazy.

347
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,010
I told you, didn't I?

348
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,840
I told you to get Oh Jang Mi
out of my sight!

349
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,950
Yes.

350
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,480
I'll handle it properly this time.

351
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,840
I was worried Oh Jang Mi
might have stopped by,

352
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,370
but I guess not.

353
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,180
This is a surprise.
You asked me to buy you a drink.

354
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,880
This and that.

355
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,580
I just have a lot on my mind.

356
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,290
Are you this upset
just because Chef Kang Jun Ho...

357
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,420
was at an external event
and you couldn't meet him?

358
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,720
It's not just that.

359
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,520
I feel like I messed up
with CEO Chae again.

360
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,760
But, you're right.

361
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,760
In the end, I didn't even get to meet
Chef Kang Jun Ho,

362
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,400
so I'm bummed.

363
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,970
Then why did you just show up there
out of the blue?

364
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,540
I wanted to apologize for what happened
with my mom, for one.

365
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
And to be honest,

366
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,580
I wanted to talk to Chef Kang Jun Ho...

367
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,910
about how I missed the interview
with CEO Chae there.

368
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,950
What does CEO Chae have to do
with you missing your interview?

369
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,320
It's complicated.

370
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,890
So it was because of CEO Chae
that you missed your interview?

371
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,030
What happened between you and CEO Chae?

372
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,910
I can't tell you.

373
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,710
I promised CEO Chae
I would keep it a secret.

374
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,940
Now I'm even more curious.

375
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,150
Fine, I get it.

376
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,120
I get it, so cheer up.

377
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,090
I'm sorry to you too, Baek Ho.

378
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,890
You always help out with my family,
and you look out for me.

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,370
I feel like I'm nothing
but a burden to everyone.

380
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Well...

381
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,740
For once, you're right.

382
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,010
What?

383
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,010
I'm kidding.

384
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,780
I'm only getting involved
out of loyalty to Tae Pyung,

385
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
so you have nothing to feel sorry about.

386
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,650
Okay?

387
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,830
You're home.

388
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,090
Yes.

389
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,600
Goodness. I'm beat.

390
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,800
Rest while I run your bath.

391
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,900
Okay.

392
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,770
Mrs. Yang, get dinner on the table now.

393
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,220
He should've just eaten out.

394
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,820
Jang Mi has returned home safe and sound.

395
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,820
Lawyer Kang, now that you're here,
stay and have some fruit.

396
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,730
- Stay and have some.
- I'm full, though.

397
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,030
You can come in.

398
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Okay, permission granted.

399
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,220
Still no luck finding who threw that rock?

400
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,720
It has to be one
of the other side dish shops in the area.

401
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm positive they're jealous
we're doing well and causing trouble.

402
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,430
- I don't think that's it.
- What?

403
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,930
This could be related to the other things
that have been happening to Jang Mi.

404
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,700
- Could it be the Viper Gang punks...
- Suk Hee!

405
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,800
What's wrong, Suk Hee?

406
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Suk Hee!

407
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,740
Open your eyes. Suk Hee!

408
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,340
Suk Hee, wake up.

409
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,350
Open your eyes. Suk Hee!

410
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,510
I'll go get some water.

411
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,980
Mom, open your eyes!

412
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,250
It's me, Jang Mi.

413
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,620
Open your eyes!

414
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,660
Ok Hee, Tok Hee...

415
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,590
- What?
- Ok Hee, Tok Hee...

416
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,560
Ok Hee...

417
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,460
Wake up, Suk Hee!

418
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,900
Suk Hee!

419
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,370
You're not Jang Mi.

420
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,570
You're pretending to be Jang Mi.

421
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,340
You're not Jang Mi.

422
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,940
- What's with this woman?
- Two Jang Mis.

423
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,380
It's Tok Hee.

424
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,910
No! Give me my baby back!

425
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,220
No!

426
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,520
From now on, this baby is mine.

427
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,650
I said she's my baby now!

428
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,990
That's my baby.

429
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,620
She's my baby!

430
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,960
Never. I won't allow it!

431
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,930
Please...

432
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,980
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

433
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,310
Mom.

434
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Please, breathe.

435
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,890
Mom! Please breathe.

436
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,650
Come on, Mom.

437
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,920
Please breathe!

438
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,090
Mom!

439
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,270
Mom!

440
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,220
(The First Man)

441
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,720
Hello, is Lawyer Kang Baek Ho in?

442
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,690
Aren't you the young lady named Jang Mi?

443
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,330
Excuse me? Jang Mi?

444
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,430
I must meet her and see what she's like.

445
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,760
If she's not the one,
I'll have to separate Baek Ho from her.

446
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,100
Why have you already decided
that Jang Mi is a bad person?

447
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,330
That man...

448
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,900
I need to get a closer look.

449
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,870
- What are you doing?
- Come here! Get over here!

450
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,010
- Who are you?
- Jang Mi!

451
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,910
