00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,510
(Episode 25)

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,920
The interview is at 10 a.m.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,990
She might have arrived already.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,530
Should I go and try to stop her now?

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,260
After all I did to keep her away
from this company...

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,270
Are you just going to stand by
and do nothing?

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,200
You have to do something to stop this.

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,400
No. I have to stop this now.

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,560
Okay, Oh Jang Mi. Just be yourself.

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,190
Don't go overboard
just because it's Chef Kang Jun Ho.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes. This is Oh Jang Mi.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,700
Gosh, why do you sound so gentle today?

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,710
I'm on my way to see Chef Kang Jun Ho.
How could I not be in a good mood?

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,010
I'm in a great mood,
so don't you dare ruin it.

15
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,950
Why are you calling?
I'm very busy, as you know.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,480
Gosh, this woman...

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,950
She's a completely different person
with me than with others.

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,620
She's totally two-faced.

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,290
What are you muttering about?

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,360
If you called, get to the point.

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,300
If you have nothing to say,
I'm hanging up.

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,500
Wait, hold on.

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,530
Gosh, why are you so impatient?

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,840
You're going to blow the interview
if you act like that.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,310
I called to tell you to keep your cool
so you could do well, Oh Jang Mi.

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,940
And don't get all nervous and go overboard
just because it's Chef Kang Jun Ho.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,880
You worry about the weirdest things.

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,490
There she is.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,600
- Prep these.
- Yes, Chef.

30
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,430
Do we have enough oysters?

31
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,330
I think we might be a little short.

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,370
- Go grab two more boxes.
- Yes, Chef.

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,540
What time is it now?

34
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,740
Someone's supposed to be here at 10 a.m.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,910
Anyway, you're going
to nail the interview...

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,080
and the cooking test...

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,650
on your first try,

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,980
so don't be nervous.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Got it?

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,550
Yes, sure. I get it, Lawyer Kang.

41
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,750
You're such a worrywart.

42
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,460
- Hey!
- Are you even listening to me?

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,600
Gosh... Yes.

44
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,530
And listen, what are you doing tonight?

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,630
I'll be waiting at the office,

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,940
so call me.
There's something I need to tell you.

47
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,700
Okay. Bye.

48
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,940
- CEO Chae, what's wrong?
- Jang Mi!

49
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,710
Jang Mi...

50
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,550
- My stomach hurts...
- What?

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,920
Does it hurt a lot?
Oh, my gosh, what do I do?

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,220
My stomach...
Please take me to the hospital.

53
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,020
What? What do I do?

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,320
But I have to go
to my interview right now.

55
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,090
- CEO Chae!
- It hurts!

56
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,930
- Take me to the hospital!
- What am I going to do?

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,370
I... But...

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,370
What is she waiting for?
Take me to the hospital already. Now!

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,710
Manager Lee!
I'll call Manager Lee for you.

60
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,610
Manager Lee!

61
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,690
The person you're calling is unavailable.

62
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,120
- Why isn't he answering?
- Connecting to voicemail.

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,390
- What am I going to do?
- It hurts so much!

64
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,060
- I'm in so much pain!
- What should I do?

65
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
It must be my appendix.

66
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,570
Oh, my! What if it's appendicitis?

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,570
There's a taxi coming! Taxi!

68
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,840
Over here! Taxi!

69
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,410
Try to get up.

70
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Taxi!

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Taxi!

72
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,750
Hey, Jun Ho. It's me.

73
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,090
You're not going to make Jang Mi work
as an unpaid intern, are you?

74
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,660
Do I have to report every little thing
to you?

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,160
Hey, what kind of a non-answer is that?

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,600
I swear, if you make her work for peanuts,
I won't stand for it.

77
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,030
It's common practice
in the fine dining industry.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,230
I also worked a lot as an unpaid intern
for a short-term in the States.

79
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,170
No way. Don't you dare do that to Jang Mi.

80
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,370
I'll report you for exploiting workers.

81
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,510
What? I'm hanging up, you punk.

82
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,380
What kind of amazing woman
has the great Kang Baek Ho so whipped?

83
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,280
I'll have to see her for myself.

84
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,600
But how can we ever repay CEO Chae?

85
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,830
I know.

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,040
Since Jang Mi decided not to go abroad,
she even arranged this position for her.

87
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,340
How can we ever repay her kindness?

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,510
Jang Mi said the exact same thing
you did, Dad.

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,880
It's Jang Mi's dream
to train under that chef.

90
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,780
I really hope she aces her interview
and gets accepted.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,990
Of course. Look who's in her corner.

92
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,720
Right. The hotel CEO is backing her.

93
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,890
No, that's not it.

94
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,630
It's the chef's brother's connection.
Lawyer Kang Baek Ho!

95
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,140
She can't even show up on time
for an interview.

96
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,160
It doesn't look like appendicitis.
It's a stress-induced stomachache.

97
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,170
I've given her a sedative,

98
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,430
so she should feel better
after getting some rest.

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,840
What a relief. Thank you.

100
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,340
- I'll help you with the payment.
- Okay. Yes.

101
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,860
I stopped her
from seeing Kang Jun Ho for now,

102
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,460
but how do I stop her in the future?

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Thank you.

(Emergency Medical Center)

105
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,740
I didn't even get to call
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

106
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,380
Shouldn't I call him now
and explain the situation?

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,530
Hello. I was scheduled
for an interview today at 10 a.m.

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,870
My name is Oh Jang Mi.

109
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,310
Chef Kang, it's about Oh Jang Mi.
She had a 10 a.m. interview today.

110
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,180
Did she just show up?

111
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,150
No, she called us.

112
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,980
She said something came up
and asked if she could still come...

113
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,980
Tell her I don't want to hear any excuses.

114
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,120
And that Oh Jang Mi woman,

115
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,720
tell her to stay out of my sight
if she's going to work in this field.

116
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
What are you standing there for?

117
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,030
Tell her that's a warning.

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,500
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,710
Excuse me?

120
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,340
Chef Kang Jun Ho warned me
to stay out of his sight?

121

(Emergency Medical Center)

123
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,930
CEO Chae, are you waking up?

124
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,100
Are you okay?

125
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,440
- Jang Mi.
- Yes.

126
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,080
The doctor said
it's a stress-induced stomachache.

127
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,360
I see. I'm so glad it's not appendicitis.

128
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,460
Shouldn't we contact your family?

129
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,860
I just need a nap.

130
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,160
I feel much better.
My stomach doesn't even hurt anymore.

131
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,270
That's a relief.

132
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,670
Thank you, Jang Mi.

133
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,910
If you hadn't been there,
I would've collapsed.

134
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,070
Imagine if I'd collapsed
in the middle of the street.

135
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,040
I could've been hit by a car.
I'd be a goner.

136
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,910
Goodness.

137
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,420
Ms. Oh Jang Mi.

138
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,150
You're my lifesaver.

139
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,450
I wouldn't say that.

140
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,290
But CEO Chae, what am I going to do?

141
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,530
- What is it?
- You're the one...

142
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,230
who gave me the chance
to work for Chef Kang Jun Ho.

143
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,340
I did?

144
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,110
I was supposed to have my interview
at 10 a.m. today, but I missed it,

145
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,880
and when I called Chang Restaurant,

146
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,310
I was told he wouldn't hear my excuse
and refused to see me.

147
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,450
Did you speak to Chef Kang Jun Ho himself?

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,620
No, the manager passed on the message.

149
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,120
So, could you...

150
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,530
please explain the situation
to him for me?

151
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Of course.

152
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,400
It's the least I can do.
You got into this mess because of me.

153
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,870
Thank you so much.

154
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,700
Thank you, CEO Chae.

155
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,870
But on one condition.

156
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,240
Sorry? A condition?

157
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,650
She's had enough time
to do the interview 5 or 6 times,

158
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,650
and still not a single call.

159
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,560
I guess she must be over the moon
about working with my brother.

160
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,030
Gosh, Kang Baek Ho.

161
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,830
I shouldn't have gotten involved.
What is this mess?

(Emergency Medical Center)

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,410
What kind of condition?

164
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,210
It's about when I collapsed on the street
and how you brought me here.

165
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,650
It's embarrassing,
so please keep it between us.

166
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,020
There's no need
to be embarrassed about that.

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
It happens.

168
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,750
- It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
- That's not true.

169
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,360
Taking care of your health is a skill.

170
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,520
How pathetic am I
to collapse on a street...

171
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,260
and become a burden to my own employee?

172
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,800
That's something
I can't accept from myself.

173
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,400
Given your perfectionist nature,

174
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,100
I can imagine this must be
a blow to your pride.

175
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,070
This should never have happened,
not on my watch.

176
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,740
Of course. I understand.

177
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,050
Your secret is safe with me.

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
Thank you, Jang Mi.

179
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,450
I guess this is how we become friends.

180
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,620
To become friends,

181
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,920
you have to share a secret.
Isn't that what they say?

182
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Come on.

183
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,590
How could I possibly be friends
with the CEO?

184
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,660
But I appreciate you saying so.

185
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,030
You've already looked out for us so much,

186
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,600
and everything you've done to help
is more than enough.

187
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,570
But...

188
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,370
about Chef Kang Jun Ho...

189
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,710
Could you please explain to him
why I missed my interview...

190
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,010
so I can get another chance to interview?

191
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,020
I know it's a lot to ask,
but please help me, CEO Chae.

192
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,520
Of course. Absolutely.

193
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,220
I'll explain everything, so don't worry.

194
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,240
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

195
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,040
- Dad.
- Jang Mi.

196
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,580
How was it? Did you get hired?

197
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
Well,

198
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
I didn't make it to the interview today.

199
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,650
What? Why not?

200
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,920
Working at the Dream Hotel's restaurant
was your dream.

201
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,850
It's just...

202
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,890
It's about when I collapsed on the street
and how you brought me here.

203
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,330
It's embarrassing,
so please keep it between us.

204
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,060
Anyway, something came up,

205
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,300
so I couldn't go. It's a shame.

206
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,170
Jang Mi, you're home! My sweet girl!

207
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,010
Jang Mi, you've been to a hospital.
You smell like one.

208
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,410
What?

209
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,920
A hospital? Did you collapse
and have to go to the hospital?

210
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,690
No, I'm perfectly healthy.
Why would I collapse?

211
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,560
- It wasn't me...
- If it wasn't you, then who?

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,360
Anyway, I can just take
the interview again,

213
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,430
so don't worry too much, Dad.

214
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,600
What?

215
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,230
Well...

(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

217
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,420
That hairpin definitely looked familiar.

218
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,440
That hairpin...

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,770
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

220
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,970
That's right. It's my hairpin.

221
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,570
The hairpin was a keepsake from my mother.

222
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,610
The one I put in my dear Ha Neul's hair.

223
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,180
But...

224
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,180
how does Oh Jang Mi have...

225
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,650
the hairpin I gave to my dear Ha Neul?

226
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,790
How could that be?

227
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,100
Mrs. Yang. Make sure you prepare
a great spread for Jun Ho.

228
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,630
Okay? Something delicious, and lots of it.

229
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,570
Seo Rin's so giddy just because
she invited that guy she likes over.

230
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,810
What are we going to do with her?

231
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,180
She's young. Let her enjoy it.

232
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,410
It's not like she's going to marry
that chef.

233
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,220
Oh, my. Mrs. Yeom.

234
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Make the flowers look more lush.
You have no taste.

235
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,890
I'll have to order more flowers.
Right, Grandpa?

236
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,020
Of course.

237
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm going to go get changed.

238
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,230
Hey, watch out. You'll get hurt.
Don't run.

239
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,330
Look at her go.

240
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,770
She's just so happy. Goodness...

241
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,610
Why are you pouting, Yeom San Wol?

242
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,310
Don't you like seeing Seo Rin so happy?

243
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,810
Oh, my. Who said I was pouting?

244
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,220
You're really something else.

245
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,450
Gosh, that woman
slanders me like that sometimes.

246
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,390
I guess she can't stand seeing me
freeloading in this house.

247
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,730
It is one more mouth to feed,
so I guess I am a freeloader.

248
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,230
Don't be silly. Of course not.

249
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,930
Her words are harsh,
but she's a good person at heart.

250
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,870
Just try to get along with her.

251
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
Okay.

- Here.
- Oh, my.

255
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,160
You shouldn't have.

256
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,890
You were a lifesaver earlier, Jang Mi.
This is to thank you.

257
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,960
It was nothing, really.

258
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,130
Thank you so much. I'll enjoy it.

259
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,740
By the way, that hairpin...

260
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,910
Sorry?

261
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,040
It's just that it seems
a little old-fashioned.

262
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,480
It doesn't seem like something
a young person would wear these days.

263
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,550
You've got a sharp eye, indeed.

264
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,720
That's right. It was my mom's.

265
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,120
Your mom's?

266
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,090
Yes, I told you before, remember?

267
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,190
About how she was chased by thugs
at a villa and got seriously hurt.

268
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,500
Right, I remember you
telling me that, Jang Mi.

269
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,570
So, your mom was wearing
that hairpin then?

270
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
Yes.

271
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,340
It really is a beautiful hairpin.

272
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,140
May I take a closer look?

273
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm thinking of getting
a similar one made for myself.

274
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,950
Of course.

275
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,120
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

276
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,560
It's the one.

277
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,620
The pearl here is faded.

278
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,860
This is definitely the hairpin
I gave to Ha Neul.

279
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,670
The caretaker at the villa
where my mom was staying...

280
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,200
found it there and gave it to my dad,
asking if it was hers.

281
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,540
He found this hairpin at the villa?

282
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,810
Then does that mean
my Ha Neul was at that villa?

283
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,250
No, that's impossible. How could that be?

284
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,650
CEO Chae, your phone's ringing.

285
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,400
CEO Chae?

286
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
What?

287
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,140
I'm sorry.

288
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,780
I was lost in thought for a moment.

289
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,210
It's okay.

290
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,850
Right.

The person you're calling is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

294
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,900
I wonder if something's wrong.

295
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,640
- Did something happen to Assistant Chae?
- Gosh, you scared me!

296
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,310
What? What's going on?

297
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,380
When did you get home?

298
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,780
You didn't go out today?

299
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,320
I've been feeling strangely chilly.

300
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,350
I think I'm coming down with a cold.

301
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,790
You should probably go to the doctor.

302
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,920
For a cold? That's nonsense.

303
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,630
Anyway, what's going on
with Assistant Chae?

304
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,700
Oh, right. She must have been busy
these past few days.

305
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,670
She's not even taking my calls.

306
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,870
I thought your assistant's name...

307
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,410
was Kim Hyo Jung.

308
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,680
Not her.
I have another one who started recently.

309
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,050
Why are you grilling me?

310
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,320
What does it matter if it's Kim or Chae?

311
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,220
Do you need to know every little detail
about my work?

312
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,850
Unbelievable.

313
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,620
There's no need to get so angry about it.

314
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,330
Goodness.

315
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,860
I'm telling you, it's andropause.

316
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,600
The way you've been so sensitive lately,

317
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,570
laughing one minute
and then flying off the handle the next.

318
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,270
It's ridiculous, really.

319
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,840
I guess you're right.

320
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,340
It must be andropause.

321
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,210
Do you want me
to make you some ginger tea?

322
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,880
We should nip that cold in the bud
before it gets worse.

323
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
That would be great, thanks.

324
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,890
Our boys...

325
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,530
get more handsome every time I see them.

326
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,970
I have to say,
I did a great job raising our two boys.

327
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,340
- Right, honey?
- Of course.

328
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Oh, honey. Didn't Jun Ho mention...

329
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,180
that he was invited
to Chairman Ma's house today?

330
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,450
Oh, that's right. He did say that.

331
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080

332
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,780

Look into it immediately.

336
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,690
All right, hold the mic in your left hand.
Just like that, nice and easy.

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,230
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

349
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,640
<i>Let's party until we drop,</i>
<i>let's have a drink</i>

350
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,400
<i>It's my treat</i>

351
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,910
<i>Let's have a drink</i>

352
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,080
- Awesome!
- You're doing great.

353
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,210
- You're doing great.
- You're killing it, Oh Tae Pyung.

354
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,350
Come on, Jun Ho.

355
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,990
If you refuse the Chairman's invitation,
it'll make me look bad.

356
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,990
Please, let's go for my sake, okay?

357
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,560
They've prepared all this food,
and they're waiting for you.

358
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,450
- Welcome.
- Thank you for having me.

359
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,120
Oh, my, you're so handsome.

360
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,790
My, you're so tall and dashing.

361
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,490
I can see why Seo Rin has a crush on you.

362
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Mom.

363
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,900
Come on in. I'm Jin Hong Ju's mother.

364
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,600
It's a pleasure to meet you.

365
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,800
It's nice to meet you.
I'm so glad you could make it.

366
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Jun Ho!

367
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,670
Isn't it nicer seeing each other
at my home instead of the restaurant?

368
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,810
Right?

369
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,510
Have a seat.

370
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,250
Come on, Jun Ho, let's take a seat.

371
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
This way.

372
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Have a seat.

373
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,220
CEO Chae didn't leave with you?

374
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,690
She wasn't in her office,
so I let Manager Lee know,

375
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,390
- and we just came by ourselves.
- Shall I get dinner ready?

376
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,530
Jun Ho, are you hungry?

377
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,700
I'm fine, thank you.

378
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
In that case, serve the aperitifs first.
And bring out the wine I picked out.

379
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,270
Chef Kang, I made sure to tell our cook
to pull out all the stops for you.

380
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,740
But I bet it's nothing compared
to your cooking.

381
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,580
Home cooking is all pretty much the same.

382
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,480
To be honest, it may not be that great,
so don't expect too much.

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,220
Mrs. Yang, what's taking so long?
Seo Rin asked for the wine.

384
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,540
What is it?

385
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,080
Today is the day
Chef Kang Jun Ho is coming to the house.

386
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,050
So he was invited.
It's not like I have to be there.

387
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,650
I'm just worried
Director Ma might cause some trouble.

388
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Seo Rin?

389
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,250
Seo Rin isn't the problem right now.

390
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,020
It's Oh Jang Mi,
the one who looks exactly like Seo Rin.

391
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,560
Her twin.
She's the one we need to worry about.

392
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,630
I heard Chef Kang warned Oh Jang Mi
never to show her face again.

393
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,330
So I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

394
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,200
That's not it!

395
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,500
I can't tell him about my Ha Neul.

396
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm dying to know why the hairpin
I gave him was at the villa.

397
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,180
What on earth happened?

398
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,350
CEO Chae. Is something wrong?

399
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,550
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

400
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,260
That's enough. You may go now.

401
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,260
Has she been waiting...

402
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,330
for Professor Kang's call so anxiously?

403
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,030
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

404
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,800
You won't have to worry
about Oh Jang Mi any longer.

405
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,910
I'll take care of it myself.

406
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,210
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

407
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,090
So, did you find anything out?

408
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,190
I asked if my Ha Neul was ever in Taean.

409
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,460
An item that belonged to Ha Neul
was discovered at the villa in Taean.

410
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,870
This proves Ha Neul was in Taean,
doesn't it?

411
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,170
You have to find out
where Ha Neul has been.

412
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,900
(The First Man)

413
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,310
How do you feel about my daughter,
Seo Rin?

414
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,480
I have no interest
in Director Ma Seo Rin whatsoever.

415
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,550
And I will never marry Director Ma.

416
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,850
I said to find out about
my Ha Neul quickly.

417
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,580
He was the baby with three moles in a row
on the back of his neck.

418
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,520
I have to find my son, no matter what.

419
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,990
And Dream will rightfully be his.

420
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,760
I'll handle it without fail this time.

421
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,890
Just keep Oh Jang Mi away from me!

422
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,970
