(Episode 8)

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,740
Right. Yes.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,710
Understood.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,180
Yes. Right.

(Dream Group Negotiating
One Billion-dollar Investment...)
(with a Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund)

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,320
Thankfully, it seems Seo Rin's photo
was well blocked in the articles.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,290
- Yes.
- What?

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,360
Of course. Okay.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,830
Okay. Yes. Right. I get it.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,230
Mom, hang on.

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,970
What? Bring my resume?

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,970
Okay, got it.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
Stop the car!

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,130
That woman! That's Jung Suk Hee!

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,060
She's pregnant too?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,270
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,930
This is where you live, is it?

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,770
You just wait.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,450
I'm afraid the baby had
already passed away.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,510
Bring my son back! Bring him back!

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,950
I lost my baby because of you.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,120
All because of you.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,020
Jung Suk Hee?

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,960
Mom!

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,690
Hey, that's dangerous. What are you doing?
Let's go. I have to get somewhere.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Excuse us!

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,210
(CEO's Office)

28
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,290
What was that?

29
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,560
Was that really Jung Suk Hee?

30
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,190
No! Give me back my baby! No!

31
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,570
Please give my babies back.
Please don't do this!

32
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,370
Did she run at me because
she recognized me?

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,540
If so, after I took her child,
why has she stayed quiet all this time?

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,340
Even though she knows exactly who I am...

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,180
What on earth is going on?

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Right. It must be someone else.

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,160
If it's truly Jung Suk Hee, there's no way
she would've stayed quiet until now.

38
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,460
It's been so many years.

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,990
How could I possibly recognize her now?

40
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,300
No. It can't be.

41
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,260
Right. It was some other woman.

42
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,370
Right.

43
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,370
Still, just in case...

44
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,570
I have to make sure.

45
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,010
President Hwang.

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,950
I told you to produce his album.
What's the problem?

47
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,810
I already said I'm paying for it.

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
All of a sudden?

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,150
I just don't get it.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Just the other day
you were calling his singing noise.

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,230
- What's with the sudden change of heart?
- On second thought,

52
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,400
I think we could use it as a jingle
for our hotel on the cheap.

53
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,210
Oh Tae Pyung, reporting for duty!
I came as fast as I could.

54
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,340
How come you're alone today?
Where's your legal counsel?

55
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,080
I got the call so suddenly
that I just rushed right over.

56
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,650
Lawyer Kang is probably
at the courthouse right about now.

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,580
- You mean your friend is a real lawyer?
- Yes, of course.

58
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,050
Didn't Lawyer Kang give you
his business card?

59
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,860
A lawyer, of all people...

60
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,260
He's my friend, but Baek Ho
is just a huge busybody.

61
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,900
He even gives free legal advice to seniors
at the community center sometimes.

62
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,600
Civil Code, Article 826.

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,010
Despite the legal duty of a married couple
to cooperate in maintaining the household,

64
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,780
throughout this marriage,
the defendant took it for granted...

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,180
that the plaintiff alone would handle
most of the housework and childcare.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,220
Do you have a rebuttal?

67
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,150
Your Honor.

68
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,290
My client was handling
an overwhelming workload,

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
and we admit he did not
participate enough in the home.

70
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
However, that in itself...

71
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,760
can hardly be considered
grounds for divorce.

72
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,730
A marital relationship
is a matter to be resolved...

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
through mutual understanding
and cooperation, correct?

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,140
Did you just say "mutual
understanding and cooperation?"

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,210
My client, while undergoing treatment,
tried to discuss improving the situation,

76
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,540
didn't the defendant refuse
to address the problem?

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,410
Here are the relevant documents.

78
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,150
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

79
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
Oh my!

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,460
What am I going to do? What do I do?

81
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,140
Jang Mi, what's the matter?

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,610
That's our little bunny's bathtub.
The little bunny loves it.

83
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,280
The little bunny takes a bath in it.

84
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,480
Gosh, Mom, this isn't even mine!

85
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, dear. Our Jung Suk Hee
has really outdone herself.

86
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,690
- Wasn't this Tae Pyung's?
- No. It belongs to some jerk...

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,420
No, it's not.

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,390
Dad, don't worry about it.

89
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,300
He's going to flip out when he finds out
what happened to his guitar. What do I do?

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Gosh.

91
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,110
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

92
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,080
What? I wonder what's up with Tae Pyung.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,120
What? You're really going to
give me an album deal?

94
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,860
I am.

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,760
But there are a few things
I need to review first.

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,930
- Yes, whatever you need!
- Did you bring your resume?

97
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,000
Of course.

98
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,200
President Hwang asked me
to bring a resume,

99
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,700
so I whipped one up right away.

100
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,570
But do I really need a resume
to release an album?

101
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,910
(Oh Tae Pyung, Education, Military,
Language Skills, Work Experience)

102
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,350
Why is your family information missing
from your resume?

103
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,850
Pardon? My family information?

104
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,590
My family...

105
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,430
I have my parents, a married older sister,
and a younger sister.

106
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,590
Really?

107
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,630
That's odd.

108
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,300
I could have sworn he called the woman
he was with, Jung Suk Hee, "Mom."

109
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,000
Or was that not Jung Suk Hee?

110
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,540
My family absolutely loves my singing.

111
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,310
If I make an album,
they'll promote the heck out of it.

112
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll need to test your voice again,
so next time you come,

113
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,050
- bring your family relation certificate.
- My what?

114
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay, I will.

115
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,660
Don't forget.
The family relations certificate.

116
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,880
Director Ma, you're in again today.

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,020
- Are you disappointed to see me here?
- Goodness, no. I'm just happy to see you.

118
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,590
This is the first time in almost a year
that you've come in every day.

119
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,390
Are you getting lunch?
Can I order you something?

120
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,330
What are you doing here,
Assistant Manager Jin?

121
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,790
I'm here for the new restaurant
that's opening soon.

122
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,830
I came to check on its progress.

123
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,400
But Director Ma,

124
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,530
what on earth brings you here?

125
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,970
Assistant Manager Jin.

126
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,870
You're here to "check on the progress,"
you said?

127
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,710
If that's what you're doing,

128
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,210
then so am I.

129
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,250
Stop acting like only you work here.
It's obnoxious.

130
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,980
What? Obnoxious?

131
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
The nerve of her!

132
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,660
And here I thought you just came to eat.
By all means, get to work.

133
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,920
Don't let me stop you.

134
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Hey.

135
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,660
We have a new head chef, don't we?

136
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,200
Get him in here.

137
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,900
Chef Kang Jun Ho? Why do you need him?

138
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,110
I'm Kang Jun Ho.

139
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,040
Assistant Manager Jin,
you can go back to work.

140
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,650
I'm sure things are piling up
in the Food and Beverage office.

141
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,430
Obnoxious? Look who's talking.

(Director of Food and Beverage,
Ma Seo Rin)

143
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,890
- Sit down. I don't bite.
- Are you always this crass?

144
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,190
Yes. This is me.

145
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Chef Kang Jun Ho, what do you recommend?

146
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,470
What's the one dish
this restaurant is most proud of?

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,670
We're not open yet,
so we're not fully prepared,

148
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,540
but I can make you a dish
you'll never forget.

149
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
Is that so?

150
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,850
After all that hype,

151
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,610
what are you going to do if it's bad?

152
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,350
There's no chance of that.

153
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,390
Just brimming with confidence, aren't you?

154
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,060
All right. I'll be waiting.

155
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,690
One more thing.

156
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,800
If this tastes bad,
you have to go out with me. Deal?

157
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,570
And if it's good,
don't you ever say that to me again.

158
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,110
Do I look like a joke to you?

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Wow.

160
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
Bravo!

161
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,980
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
I like you even more now.

162
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,630
Okay.

163
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Really?

164
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,470
So you're saying Director Ma said that?

165
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,810
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

166
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,320
Hey, Tae Pyung.

167
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,690
Really?

168
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,690
They're going to help you
release an album?

169
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,220
Yes, I'm telling you, it's for real.

170
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,560
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or not.

171
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,200
It looks like you're finally
about to spread your wings.

172
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
Man, that's awesome.

173
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,470
Hey, come by my office later
to practice your singing, all right?

174
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,610
Singing? Is he an aspiring singer?

175
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,440
He'll flip when he sees the broken guitar.
What do I do?

176
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,850
All right. Come by later.

177
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
When did you get here?

178
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
Just now.

179
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,790
You seem to be in a good mood.

180
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,230
Something good happened
to a friend of mine...

181
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,490
Anyway!

182
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't go prying into
other people's business.

183
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Here.

184
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,140
Who said I wanted to know?
I couldn't care less, actually.

185
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,140
Just look inside.

186
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,370
I bought the exact same one you did.

187
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,810
- You bought it?
- Don't look at me like that.

188
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,850
The thing is,

189
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,350
my mom wore it,
thinking I'd bought it for her.

190
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,890
A likely story.

191
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,700
Now, can I have my guitar back?

192
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,770
Right.

193
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,100
The thing is...

194
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,140
Wait.

195
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,570
First...

196
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,910
- I have a confession to make.
- A confession?

197
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,150
What is with you?

198
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,150
- It's just that...
- What?

199
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,820
- It's just...
- What is it?

200
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,360
Unbelievable.

201
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,020
Don't tell me you've fallen for me.

202
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,030
Is that the confession
you're trying to make?

203
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,430
What did you just say?

204
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,360
I can't believe this guy.

205
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,900
You've got to be kidding me.

206
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,340
I came here to be humble
because I messed up,

207
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,140
but I just can't stand this.

208
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,080
- Messed up?
- Yes, I have something to tell you!

209
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,150
The guitar...

210
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm so sorry.

211
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,630
- Here's what happened...
- My angel.

212
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,730
What happened to my angel?

213
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,030
Hey!

214
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,210
I polished it really well.

215
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,480
You can probably still play it
if you just change the strings.

216
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,680
Look.

217
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,520
You think "sorry" fixes everything?

218
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,860
If you killed someone,
would saying "sorry" be the end of it?

219
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,730
How can you compare a broken guitar
to someone dying?

220
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,300
I already said I was sorry.
If someone apologizes,

221
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,330
you should have the decency to accept it.
A man shouldn't be so petty.

222
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Why are you freaking out
over some stupid guitar?

223
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,540
You're the one in the wrong.
How dare you yell at me?

224
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,110
I'm yelling because you won't accept it!
What else do you want from me?

225
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,210
Unbelievable.

226
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,210
If you hadn't taken my mom's shopping bag
in the first place,

227
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,450
none of this would've happened.

228
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,690
Hey. You're the one who shared my cab.

229
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,290
You got off first
and took my shopping bag.

230
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,660
And you're the one
who just up and stole my guitar.

231
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,790
Stole? Why are you calling me a thief?
This is ridiculous.

232
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,060
Here.

233
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,840
This should be enough for new strings,
and then some.

234
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,780
Do you have any idea
how much this guitar costs?

235
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,780
You can't even buy this model
in the country.

236
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,720
Here, take a look.

237
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,920
See if this chump change
even begins to cover it.

238
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
Ones, tens, hundreds...

239
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,630
Wait, 3,000 dollars?

240
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,530
What kind of a guitar costs
over 3,000 dollars?

241
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,000
My angel was handmade by a master luthier.

242
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,340
Wait, don't tell me
you expect me to pay for the whole thing.

243
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
Of course.

244
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,210
Why would you take a perfectly fine guitar
and wreck it like this?

245
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
But...

246
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,080
That's not fair.
It's clearly a used guitar.

247
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,520
Do you know the price difference
between a brand new car and a used one?

248
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,690
So you think this covers
the resale value of my guitar?

249
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,660
This guitar...

250
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,760
belongs to someone debuting soon.

251
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,790
Did you ask why
I made the comparison to someone dying?

252
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,860
This guitar is as important to me
as my own life right now.

253
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,030
Then what am I supposed to do?

254
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,270
What, you want me to
bring it back from the dead?

255
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,670
You're the one who said it was dead.

256
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,470
Are you seriously joking around
with me right now?

257
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,810
- I'm just frustrated, okay?
- Settle in court, or do I press charges?

258
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,650
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'll handle the details.

259
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,980
I'll see you in court.

260
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,820
What? No, wait!

261
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,460
I'll be in touch. So you just wait.

262
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,290
Hold on...

263
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
What the...

264
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,150
- Father, I'm home.
- Yes.

265
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,750
San Wol, you make yourself
right at home, don't you?

266
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,050
What brings you here this time?

267
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,720
The flowers were just so lovely,
I just had to buy some.

268
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,460
You like these flowers too, don't you?

269
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,590
They really liven up the place, you know.

270
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,230
- Don't you think so, Chairman?
- Yes, they're not bad.

271
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,140
Has Seo Rin come home yet?

272
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,440
You knew about it too?

273
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,670
- I'm sorry?
- I hear...

274
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,240
Seo Rin likes the chef
at Chang Restaurant.

275
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,280
Pardon?

276
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,740
What do you mean?

277
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,480
The rumor's already all over the company.

278
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,680
That's ridiculous.
When would Seo Rin have met Chef Kang,

279
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,050
let alone develop a crush so quickly?

280
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,390
That's not true, Father. It can't be.

281
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,590
This is just a malicious rumor
to drag our Seo Rin down.

282
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,000
We'll find out
when we ask Seo Rin herself.

283
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,570
Oh my.

284
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,450
Gosh, this is awful.

285
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,260
That completely ruined my appetite.

286
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,360
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

287
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,230
Since this is terrible too,
you have to go out with me now. Got it?

288
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,140
Then why did you clean your plate
like you were enjoying it so much?

289
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,240
You couldn't help it.
It was so delicious it went right down.

290
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,880
If the customer says it's bad,
then it's bad.

291
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,060
- Dad, I'm sorry you had to work alone.
- Not at all. You have perfect timing.

292
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,530
Mind the store for a bit.
I'll go make a delivery.

293
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,830
Where to? I'll take it.
Dad, you should get some rest.

294
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,000
Would you?

295
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,040
It's so busy, but I wonder
where your brother is, slacking off.

296
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,040
Good grief. That kid is
completely useless.

297
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Here.

298
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,880
- Where's the delivery to?
- The fruit stand.

299
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,780
- I'll just zip over on the scooter.
- I'm coming with you, Jang Mi.

300
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,520
Mom, you just want a ride
on the scooter, don't you?

301
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,290
Yes, riding behind you is fun.

302
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,660
Your mom gets stir-crazy
being cooped up at home all the time.

303
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,430
Let her get some fresh air.

304
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,600
- Drive safe.
- Okay. Let's go, Mom.

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
- This is exciting! Let's go.
- We'll be back.

306
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,840
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

307
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,510
Mom, we're here.

308
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,180
There we go.

309
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,810
- Let's go.
- Okay.

310
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,090
Mom, wait right here. I'll be quick, okay?

311
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Jang Mi.

312
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,220
My head is ringing.

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,430
That's because you keep
tapping your head like that.

314
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,130
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

315
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,730
Hello.

316
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,070
Having a busy day?
I'm here with your side dish delivery.

317
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,370
I asked for Mr. Oh to make the delivery,

318
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,740
so why did you show up?
I wanted to see Mr. Oh.

319
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,350
Excuse me?
You're being really inappropriate.

320
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,210
Why do you keep acting this way
toward my dad?

321
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,250
What do you mean, "why?"
Do you need a reason to like someone?

322
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,550
I'm trying to make a move on your dad,
but he's not taking the bait.

323
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,120
What did you just say?

324
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,730
My father is a married man.

325
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,430
And you're trying to seduce a married man?

326
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,800
A wife? You call your mother,
who's clearly not all there, a wife?

327
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,970
- She can't even act like a proper wife.
- Watch your mouth.

328
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,210
Am I wrong?

329
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,250
Let's be honest here.
If you really cared about your father,

330
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,110
you wouldn't let him live
with that half-wit of a mother.

331
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,520
You'd let him be with a vibrant woman.
You're just being a bad daughter.

332
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,590
Ma'am!

333
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,960
Don't you dare talk like that.
My mom is not a half-wit.

334
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,490
- Unbelievable.
- "Nothing wrong with her," my foot.

335
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,530
That burdensome half-wit.

336
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,230
Ma'am!

337
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,570
Stop calling her a half-wit.
You can't talk about people that way.

338
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
It's not like my mom...

339
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,370
Do you think she wanted
to end up like that?

340
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,280
How dare you stare me down
and talk back to me!

341
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,050
What if you get in a car accident
tomorrow and become a half-wit?

342
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,980
Or end up in a vegetative state?
You never know.

343
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,020
What? How dare you jinx me like that!

344
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,490
Unbelievable.

345
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,420
- This little brat...
- Jang Mi.

346
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,520
Jang Mi.

347
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Mom.

348
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,460
Mom, stop!

349
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,400
Stop it, Mom.

350
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,970
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

351
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,700
- It's okay.
- Blood!

352
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,240
Darn it. Are you both nuts?

353
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,940
I can't even get a grip on her
with this helmet on.

354
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,510
You brat! Jang Mi, get over here.

355
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,180
Let me go! You're the one who's crazy!

356
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,190
- Get over here!
- Apologize to her! What did my mom do?

357
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,860
Does she look normal to you?

358
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,290
Look at this pair of crazies,
acting like total idiots.

359
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,130
I told you. You're the one who's crazy.

360
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,300
How dare you try to seduce a married man?
If that's not crazy, what is?

361
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,300
Let go of my Jang Mi.

362
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Let go!

363
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,980
- Mom, stop it.
- Let go!

364
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,020
What? She asked
for your family relation certificate?

365
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,090
Yes. Why would that be necessary
for releasing an album?

366
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Beats me.

367
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,130
Maybe it's not about an album.
You think she's trying to hire you?

368
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,460
Really?

369
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,030
(Younger Sister)

370
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,500
Tae Pyung, is it
from the pretty little sister of yours?

371
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,870
Hey, come on.
I told you, don't even think about it.

372
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,910
Hey, Jang Mi.

373
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,980
Jang Mi? Hey, that's a pretty name.
Come on, introduce us already.

374
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,080
What? Is Mom at it again?

375
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,760
Officer, you know Suk Hee.
She wouldn't do this on purpose.

376
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,900
You should try to settle with the victim,
not me.

377
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,040
Ms. Kim, are you badly hurt?

378
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,380
I don't know how a simpleton is so strong.
She just kept headbutting me.

379
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,980
Mr. Oh,

380
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm bruised and aching all over.

381
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,480
Listen here, lady.
You keep saying she's a simpleton.

382
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,290
I told you, you never know.
An accident could do the same to you.

383
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,190
Keep talking like that
and you'll get what's coming to you.

384
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,230
Why do you keep saying such awful things?
You're jinxing me.

385
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,530
You have to be nice to be treated nicely.

386
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,800
This lady here is the one
who started saying horrible things!

387
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,970
How dare you talk back?
Is that how you speak to your elders?

388
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,240
Don't you yell at my Jang Mi!

389
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,110
You're a bad lady. A bad person.
I'll punish the bad person.

390
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,980
Oh my, look at her.
That half-wit is really putting on a show.

391
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,750
- The whole family's nuts.
- Ms. Kim!

392
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,320
Watch your mouth.

393
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,150
What did I do wrong?

394
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,090
Apologize to my Suk Hee.

395
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,220
She's just unwell because of an accident.

396
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,390
Apologize, or I'll sue you for defamation.
It's your choice.

397
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,230
You all saw that, didn't you?
Right? You're all witnesses.

398
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,900
No, wait, when did I ever slander her?

399
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,100
Gosh...

400
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,200
Fine.

401
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,910
Mr. Oh is a little scary when he's mad.

402
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,410
(Police)

403
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,810
- Mom!
- Tae Pyung!

404
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,680
- Tae Pyung!
- Are you okay?

405
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,620
- What took you so long?
- Your face...

406
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,350
The whole family showed up.

407
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,490
Unbelievable.

408
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,860
That woman... I swear!

409
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,070
Jun Ho. How was your first day?

410
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,970
- So, how's the work?
- It's the same old thing.

411
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,140
We haven't officially opened yet,
so there's not a whole lot to do.

412
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,370
So when's the grand opening?

413
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,380
On opening day, yours truly will go
and give it a taste test.

414
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,050
Honey, should I go too?

415
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,920
Gosh, why would the whole family go?
You'll just put pressure on Jun Ho.

416
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,920
- You think so?
- Yes.

417
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,220
- Is that true, Jun Ho?
- You can come if you want.

418
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,630
Since the hotel's being renovated,
I think they'll probably have a party.

419
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,130
My university is working with them
on the new setup for the Dream Hotel.

420
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
So, Dad, you'll be going
to the Dream Hotel a lot then?

421
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,400
Yes. For now, I'm working
with the project team,

422
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,800
but I expect I'll be meeting
with your CEO soon enough.

423
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,350
Yes, sir.

424
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,050
Right, okay. Mom, hang on.

425
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,750
Okay. Yes. Right. I get it.

426
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,250
Okay, got it.

427
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,980
Chae Hwa Young, please...

428
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,890
You want to know what you can do?

429
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,390
You're asking me what you can do?

430
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,230
Get out of my sight. Just disappear!
That's the only way!

431
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,270
Die! Just disappear!

432
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,140
- Die! Let go!
- Hwa Young, stop.

433
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,340
- Let go of me!
- Hwa Young.

434
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,640
I said, let go!

435
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,780
My baby wouldn't have died
if it weren't for this wench!

436
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,650
You want to know what you can do?

437
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,350
Bring my baby back to life!
Just bring my baby back!

438
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,880
Baby?

439
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,520
Please just spare my baby.

440
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,030
I don't care if I die. My baby...

441
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,460
Just please spare my baby.

442
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
That was definitely Jung Suk Hee's face.

443
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,740
No matter how much time has passed,
there's no way I'd forget that face.

444
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,750
(Oh Tae Pyung)

445
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,350
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes, 101,
21 Migang-ro 7-gil, Seonha, Seoul)

446
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,050
Once I confirm it with my own two eyes,

447
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,150
then it will all make sense.

448
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,860
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

449
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,470
Suk Hee...

450
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,280
Be careful! Oh my.

451
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,380
Are you okay? Here, get up.

452
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,780
- For goodness' sake!
- Jung Suk Hee.

453
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,820
- It really is Jung Suk Hee!
- Oh no, your hand! Oh my...

454
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,890
Yes, that's right.
There's no doubt it's her.

455
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,750
(The First Man)

456
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,980
Jung Suk Hee is alive.
So you go and confirm it for yourself.

457
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,480
Find out what happened.

458
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,290
We've got a customer!

459
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,890
Didn't you say you have a friend
who's a lawyer?

460
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,530
Hello. I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

461
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,360
That voice sounds really familiar.

462
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,700
What am I going to do
if she gets her memory back?

463
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,500
And the other twin from back then...

464
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,970
What if that child is still alive too?
