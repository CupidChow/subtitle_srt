00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,940
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello, this is Chae Hwa Young.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,780
Ma'am.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,710
Please, get Director Ma out of my sight.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,980
Who?

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,950
Kang Jun Ho?

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,850
How rude.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,260
I think the rude one is Director Ma,
sitting here gawking at me.

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,160
She's a distraction.
Please, just come and get her.

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,730
That's all.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,430
That insolent brat!

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,070
But did you really have to call my mom
over it?

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,170
Okay, message received.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,710
It'll just be a scene if my mom shows up,
so I'll get out of your hair for today.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
See you.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,300
Kang Jun Ho!

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,960
Who do you think you are,
telling me what to do with my daughter?

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,710
Just because you're the CEO,

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,550
does that mean you can lay your hands
on an employee?

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,750
This is a blatant abuse of power.
Should I report you?

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,020
Fine, do it. Go ahead and report me.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,620
What on earth did I do wrong
to make you so upset?

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,730
Who do you think you are telling me
to get rid of my daughter?

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,730
How arrogant.

25
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,900
- Your daughter just didn't get the hint!
- What did you say?

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,900
I've put up with a lot from you,
but what did you just say?

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,970
She didn't get the hint?

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,070
I made it clear
that I'm not interested in her.

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,540
But she's so clingy. If she keeps this up,
I'll have to report her for stalking.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,140
Clingy? A stalker?

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,310
Make this very clear to Director Ma.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,750
If she keeps this up,
I will report her for stalking.

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,790
You're her mother.
You can keep her in line, can't you?

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,360
Do you realize
you're crossing a line right now?

35
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,390
You're trying to get a rise out of me,
aren't you?

36
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,360
You're testing my patience,
you arrogant punk!

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,700
Let go of me.

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,610
This is assault.

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,840
And this isn't the first time.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Do you have any idea
how much I've put up with you?

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,320
How dare you dislike my daughter?
Why do you dislike her so much?

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,420
This is an insult and a challenge to me.

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,790
Are you laughing?

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,230
You should be throwing yourself
at my daughter's feet,

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,160
what makes you so special?
How dare you dislike my daughter?

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,900
Who do you think you are to turn her down?

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,040
Calling her clingy? And a stalker?

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,410
- How dare you!
- If you're the CEO, then act like one.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,310
Have some dignity.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,780
Don't go around hitting your employees.

51
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,520
If I report this for abuse of power,
your position as CEO will be in jeopardy.

52
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,320
- Is that what you want?
- Go ahead and report me.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,390
And you think you'll get away unscathed?

54
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,860
You'll be blacklisted forever
as the employee who reported his boss.

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,860
Do you think you'll ever find work again?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,930
Your career will be over.

57
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,470
That's just your wishful thinking.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,570
I won't let that happen.

59
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm so bored.

60
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,730
Maybe I should take up pottery.

61
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,230
I'm warning you.

62
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,470
Watch yourself.

63
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,070
Don't cross the line again.

64
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,170
Please leave now.

65
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,420
"199005."

66
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,090
What's that?

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,890
Is that a date of birth?

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,730
What are you doing?

69
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,100
That tattoo on your neck.

70
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,100
- What do those numbers mean?
- Why the sudden interest?

71
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
Just answer the question.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,810
I see.

73
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,610
So now you're going to use my tattoo
as an excuse to fire me?

74
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,910
How dare you talk back to me like that?

75
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,420
Just tell me if it's a birthdate
or if it has some special meaning.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,690
That's it.

77
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,750
I give up.

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,820
As you wish,

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
I will give serious thought to resigning.

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,860
I need to think about
whether I should keep working under you...

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
or if I should just quit.

82
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,300
Hey! I'm not finished talking to you!

83
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,570
(Public Release of Suspect Information,
Name: Park Soon Sun)

84
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,950
So you're saying this is the gangster
you were looking for when you got hurt?

85
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,920
Ssangkal must have lured Jang Mi.

86
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,050
This was clearly premeditated.

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,090
I don't care what gang he's in.

88
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,860
I'll find that punk and make him pay.

89
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,460
- Darn it.
- But every crime has a motive,

90
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,730
- but I just don't know what it is.
- You mentioned it before, Baek Ho.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,300
That maybe the banner revealed
that my mom was alive,

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,640
and you thought that might be
how they found out about me.

93
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,670
Right. But that doesn't add up either.

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,710
I can't figure out why anyone
would want to hurt you, Jang Mi.

95
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,710
There was the time
she almost got hit by a car,

96
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,780
and the time
a sign almost fell on her head,

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,290
and this time, she was almost kidnapped.

98
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,860
These aren't just
a series of coincidences.

99
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,860
So you're saying
someone's trying to kill Jang Mi?

100
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,330
But why on earth
would they target Jang Mi?

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,100
No, that can't be it. Why would anyone
try to kill a nobody like me?

102
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,630
Baek Ho, I don't think that's it.
It has to be a coincidence.

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,300
Even so, you have to be careful.

104
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,970
It's just that my Jang Mi...

105
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
"My" Jang Mi?

106
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,310
- Kang Baek Ho, punk. What's with "my?"
- What about "my?"

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,750
My dear Tae Pyung.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Our dear Father.

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,050
"Our dear father?"
You little punk! What did you just say?

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,520
- What do you mean, "our dear father?"
- Hey, stop it.

111
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,830
Chairman.

112
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,870
Chairman, you saw how CEO Chae...

113
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,340
bullied and abused her power
over me and my daughter, right?

114
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,010
When are you going to go public
with our relationship, Chairman?

115
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,850
I don't know how much longer
I have to live in this limbo.

116
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,880
Mrs. Yeom, time heals all wounds.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
So just be a little more patient.

118
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,260
Come on, look at Seo Rin.
She doesn't lash out at you anymore,

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,920
and we're getting along
like one big family.

120
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,430
Exactly.

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,630
That's why...

122
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,870
it's the perfect time for you to decide,
Chairman.

123
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,740
I already told you that I need more time.

124
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,970
I've just barely managed
to pacify Seo Rin,

125
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,740
and she'll come around eventually.

126
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,610
Seo Rin isn't the problem.
It's CEO Chae. I'm telling you.

127
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,350
She's making life miserable
for me and Hong Ju.

128
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,530
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

129
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,500
About Chef Kang Jun Ho,

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,800
have you ever seen the tattoo on his neck?

131
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
Sorry?

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,630
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,200
It looks like
it has some strange numbers on it.

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,740
I wonder what they could mean.

135
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,410
Why would someone get a tattoo like that?

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,980
He said it's his date of birth.

137
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
Why do you ask, ma'am?

138
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,850
It's nothing.

139
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,170
(Professor Kang)

140
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Professor Kang.

141
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I was just thinking about you, actually.

142
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,880
Are you free today?

143
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,280
(Bomdama)

144
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,650
Please have a seat over here.

146
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,260
This place is so big and clean.

147
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,060
I'll sit on the inside.

148
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,930
- Go on in.
- Welcome.

149
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,730
Lawyer Kang, why are you
treating us at a place like this?

150
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,170
Mr. Oh, does this mean
you'll finally accept me as family?

151
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,570
- What?
- Dad, just stop talking and eat.

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,410
- Okay.
- What's gotten into him?

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,210
It looks like a buffet
where we can pick what we want.

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,020
They say it's all-you-can-eat
with fresh ingredients.

155
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,090
- Thank you, Lawyer Kang.
- Not at all. Please, help yourself.

156
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,820
Awesome.

157
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,390
This is really delicious!

158
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,500
- Mom, I want some meat.
- Okay, sweetie.

159
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,430
- Dad, I want some meat too.
- It's delicious. It really is.

160
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,840
They have so many different broths.
Even Bo Ra, who hates spice, enjoys it.

161
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,410
- You're right.
- It's good, isn't it, Bo Ra?

162
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,470
It's yummy, right?

163
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,510
The meat is so delicious.
Suk Hee is going to eat a lot.

164
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,810
Please, eat a lot.

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,850
Mom, you're really eating well today.

166
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,580
Here it goes!

167
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,820
Okay, here we go.

168
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,360
Are you kidding me?

169
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,200
Seriously, did you get your law degree
from a claw machine or something?

170
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,270
- How have you not missed a single one?
- I have my own little trick to it.

171
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
No way!

172
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,540
- Oh my goodness!
- Here, this one's for Bo Ra.

173
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,510
And this one's for you, Jang Mi.

174
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,280
- This little thing? What is it?
- It's a lucky hippo.

175
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,650
In Northern Europe, a hippo doll
means good luck and prosperity.

176
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,160
Give it to me.
You're always misplacing things,

177
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,430
so I'll attach it to your bag for you.

178
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,730
- What did you say? I misplace things?
- It was a joke.

179
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Think of me...

180
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
whenever you look at it.

181
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,510
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Thank you.

183
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,950
I'm home.

184
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,250
What's this?

185
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,990
Jun Ho, is something wrong?

186
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,130
This is not like you at all.

187
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,230
- You're home?
- Yes.

188
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,630
Jun Ho, what's the matter?

189
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,270
You never even touch alcohol.
What's going on?

190
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,440
It's nothing.

191
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
I think I might have to quit my job
at the hotel because of CEO Chae.

192
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,550
- I've just been worried about it.
- No way. You can't just quit.

193
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,880
What is it with CEO Chae?

194
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,220
Why does that woman
give you such a hard time?

195
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,820
My poor son. This must be so hard on you.

196
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,430
Hwa Young, you seem a bit down today.

197
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,640
There's an insufferably arrogant employee
who's really getting under my skin.

198
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,710
An employee?

199
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,610
There's just something about him
that rubs me the wrong way.

200
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,580
He's so insolent about every little thing.

201
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,380
You should fire an employee
like that on the spot.

202
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,250
If someone's upsetting you,
I'll go have a word with them myself.

203
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,820
Who is it, anyway?

204
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,260
Knowing you're completely on my side,

205
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,530
it really warms my heart.

206
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,270
I suppose a husband and wife,

207
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,440
through all the bad times
and the hard times,

208
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,970
are supposed to stick together
and face everything as a team, right?

209
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,680
That's not always the case.

210
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,910
You know how they say you can be lonely
even when you're with someone?

211
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,050
There's a reason for that.

212
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,150
I've never experienced that...

213
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,020
in my life.

214
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,960
I've always felt empty...

215
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,360
and lived feeling
like there's a gaping hole in my heart.

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I...

217
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,010
I'll make sure you're never lonely again,
Hwa Young.

218
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,150
Professor Kang.

219
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,850
I'm always on your side, Hwa Young.

220
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,420
We're...

221
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,960
on the same team now, all right?

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,450
Would you look at him?
Didn't he come home last night?

223
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,420
I wonder if something happened.

224
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,830
What if he was in an accident?

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,850
"199005."

226
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,910
What's that?

227
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,420
Is that a date of birth?

228
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,520
Why do I feel so anxious?

229
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,790
I should've checked
whether it was a date of birth.

230
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,190
I need to see Kang Jun Ho
first thing in the morning.

231
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,260
(Wife)

232
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,670
(Child Welfare Card, Kim Young Ho)

233
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,040
(Date of Birth: May 29, 1990)

234
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,610
That's him. That's my son.

235
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,570
The date of birth is the same.

236
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,280
Who is this boy?

237
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,550
This is definitely a photo
of my Ha Neul as a child.

238
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,820
But why does Professor Kang
have this photo?

239
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,400
You're still up?

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,440
I think you got a call from home.

241
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,580
- It can wait.
- No, you should call her back.

242
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,780
She must be worried, waiting up for you.

243
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,120
I'm just going to use the restroom.

244
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,330
It has to be my Ha Neul.

245
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,830
I'm sure it's my Ha Neul.

246
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,170
So how can this be?

247
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,170
Why would Professor Kang have this photo?

248
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,340
Honey, what's going on?

249
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,980
Where are you right now?

250
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,880
What? You fell asleep
working on your thesis?

251
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,350
You need to take care of yourself.

252
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,090
You didn't come home,

253
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,130
so I got so scared, thinking you
might have been in an accident.

254
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,730
An accident? Don't be silly.
Don't worry, I'll...

255
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I'm managing just fine.

256
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,840
Why does Professor Kang
have a photo of my Ha Neul?

257
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,370
Go on to bed. I'll be home soon.
Don't worry about me.

258
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,710
Okay.

259
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,480
Thanks for being so understanding.
Looks like my wife was waiting up for me.

260
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,150
And she waited up
even though she has a cold.

261
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,930
I'm sorry.

262
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,530
I didn't mean to look,

263
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,000
but I was getting your phone when I saw
your wallet had fallen on the floor.

264
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,070
But...

265
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,940
do you have two sons?

266
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,480
Yes, I have two sons.

267
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,180
And you have only one daughter,
Director Ma, right?

268
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,920
I thought your only son was Kang Baek Ho,
the lawyer.

269
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,550
So then,

270
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,450
what does your other son do?

271
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,990
Well, the thing is...

272
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,090
(Manager Lee)

273
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,260
Hwa Young, your phone's ringing.

274
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,830
You should get that.

275
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,670
Yes, it's me.

276
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,550
CEO Chae, I'm coming in.

277
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,620
Oh my.

278
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
What's going on?

279
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,990
So Chae Hwa Young spent the night out?

280
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh my.

281
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,870
Chairman! CEO Chae didn't come home
last night.

282
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,440
This is definitely proof
that she's seeing a man.

283
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,480
- She stayed out all night?
- Yes.

284
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,320
Chairman, it looks like
we'll have to marry off CEO Chae soon.

285
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,020
I don't know whether
this is a good or a bad thing,

286
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,190
but in the prime of her life,

287
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,830
how many years has she spent all alone
as a faithful widow?

288
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,670
You just have to turn a blind eye...

289
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,670
and let CEO Chae leave this house.

290
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,670
What other choice is there?

291
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Mrs. Yeom.

292
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,940
I didn't realize you were so indiscreet.

293
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,680
- What?
- You aren't sure of anything yet,

294
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,510
- so why must you be such a gossip?
- Oh my goodness.

295
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,310
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,880
- I only thought it was for the best...
- Shut up.

297
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,190
You've got some nerve
slandering my mother.

298
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,220
You think I don't know what you're up to?

299
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,990
You want to kick my mom out of this house,

300
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,860
so you and Hong Ju
can take over this house and Dream Group.

301
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,930
How could you...

302
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,570
Director Ma, that's a baseless accusation.
How could you say such terrible things?

303
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,570
I swear on my life
I've never even considered such a thing.

304
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,710
Seo Rin, that's enough.
That's no way to speak to your elders.

305
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,950
Grandfather,
this woman is saying my mom...

306
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,010
was out all night with a man.
She's just running her mouth!

307
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,080
So you're telling me to just let it slide
when she's slandering my mom?

308
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,690
Oh my goodness.

309
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,290
This is so unfair.
It's so unfair I can't stand it.

310
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,630
Slandering? Who is slandering anyone?

311
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,730
So I'm not even allowed to say
CEO Chae didn't come home last night?

312
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,500
Unbelievable.

313
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,870
Seriously.

314
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,680
Just you wait.

315
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,650
I'm sure of it.
Chae Hwa Young is seeing a man.

316
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,490
One way or another, I'll find proof
and get her kicked out of this house.

317
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,930
I hope things work out between my Hong Ju
and the youngest son of Jinan Chemicals.

318
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,340
I wonder if she had a chance
to talk to him by the Han River.

319
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,080
It's about time
for Lawyer Kang Baek Ho to show up.

320
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,780
I'm sure it was around this time.

321
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,230
Yes, there he is.
It's Lawyer Kang Baek Ho.

322
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,940
Oh my goodness!

323
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,500
Don't you recognize me?

324
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,610
Last time when I fell,
you put a bandage on me,

325
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,380
and you even hailed a cab for me.
Remember?

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,580
I did? No, I never put a bandage on you.

327
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,420
Right. You didn't put it on,
but you gave it to me.

328
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,620
The bandage.

329
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
And the taxi.

330
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,720
Right. Yes.

331
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,560
What a coincidence, running into you here.

332
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,190
I guess you usually run around this time.

333
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,060
Sometimes, when I'm not too busy.

334
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,600
My bike broke down,
so I was just jogging and...

335
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,610
Are you all right?

336
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,510
Be careful.

337
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,950
What the heck?

338
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,080
He didn't even try to catch me.
He just left.

339
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
Unbelievable.

340
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,630
I told the Chairman
that you were in meetings all night...

341
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,100
about the Dream Resort project.

342
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,370
Okay, got it.

343
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,870
Were you...

344
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
with Professor Kang?

345
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,370
What are you going to do
if the Chairman finds out?

346
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
Kang Hyuk.

347
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,680
Yes. What is it?

348
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,750
I've kept Ha Neul a secret all this time,

349
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,780
but is now the right time to tell him?

350
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,260
What's wrong, Hwa Young?

351
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,930
Have them bring up the documents
for my approval.

352
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,030
Are you actually thinking of
remarrying Professor Kang?

353
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,100
Are you just going to throw away Dream
you've worked for all this time?

354
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,430
All for some man?

355
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,740
- Don't be dramatic. It's not like that.
- Then what is it?

356
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,770
You were with Professor Kang yesterday.

357
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,010
I'm tired. Get out.

358
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,780
And cancel all my afternoon appointments.

359
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,020
- Didn't you hear me? I said get out.
- Hwa Young...

360
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,390
I said get out!

361
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,490
Why have you been hiding
so many things from me lately?

362
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,630
Since when do we have
so many secrets between us?

363
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,530
Lee Kang Hyuk.
I told you not to cross the line.

364
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,560
Who do you think you are to me?

365
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,500
- Where do you get off being so arrogant?
- Chae Hwa Young.

366
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,370
So you're really not going to tell me?

367
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,340
Just because Kang Jun Ho
looks down on me and acts so arrogant,

368
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,470
does that mean I'm a joke to you, too?

369
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Is that it?

370
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,080
You know that's not true.

371
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,490
It's just that you won't confide in me...

372
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
and it's starting to hurt.

373
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,730
Don't be late for the meeting.

374
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,060
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

375
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,970
I'm sure CEO Chae is seeing a man.

376
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,170
Are you serious?

377
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,840
Mom, that's great news for us then!

378
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,910
Absolutely. Of course it is.

379
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,480
But that little brat Seo Rin
was making a huge fuss,

380
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,890
telling the Chairman that we're trying
to take over Dream and all that.

381
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,290
- And she was right on the money.
- Seriously?

382
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,260
- She's sharp as a tack.
- The way she ran her mouth scared me.

383
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,300
Ma Seo Rin is a sneaky little fox.
She was onto us the whole time.

384
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,400
She's always one step ahead.

385
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,300
Anyway, we have to be extra careful.

386
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,410
By the way, you're at the company,
so see if Chae Hwa Young is dating...

387
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,610
or where she's meeting this guy.
Keep a close watch on her.

388
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,350
Come on, you don't really think
she'd bring him into the company, do you?

389
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,280
You never know.

390
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,180
Love affairs usually start
when you see each other every day,

391
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,950
and things happen with someone
right under your nose.

392
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,990
Got it.

393
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,700
Chae Hwa Young, you're finished.

394
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,300
The day you get caught seeing a man,
it's over for you.

395
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,100
So much for that holier-than-thou act.

396
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,110
- I'm here.
- Hey.

397
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,010
What?

398
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,440
- What is all this?
- It's nothing.

399
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,750
Hey, my arm's about to fall off.

400
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,980
Mr. Oh, after that shock,
Jang Mi needs to eat well for a while.

401
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,720
Otherwise,
she could develop a chronic condition.

402
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,420
What?

403
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,750
Well, you're right.

404
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,190
Baek Ho, can I talk to you for a second?

405
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,370
What is it?

406
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,570
What do you think you're doing?

407
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,640
What? What do you mean?

408
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,410
I already feel so indebted to you,

409
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,580
so why are you making this
so uncomfortable for me?

410
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,720
Are you trying to bury me in debt
or something?

411
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,750
Come on, why would you even say that?

412
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,150
Since you went through
such a shocking experience,

413
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,060
I thought you should eat well
and get back on your feet quickly...

414
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,690
Did you ever stop to think
how much pressure this puts on me?

415
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,560
- Jang Mi.
- You bought my family dinner yesterday.

416
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,740
Why am I always on the receiving end?
Relationships are about give and take.

417
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,510
I have nothing to give you in return
except for some side dishes,

418
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,580
so why do you keep making me the taker?

419
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,880
Who says you have nothing to give?

420
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,280
You have plenty to give me too.

421
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,450
What are you talking about?

422
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,850
Think about it carefully.

423
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,790
Think about what you can offer me.

424
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,560
I mean it, think hard.

425
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,130
You don't have to come up with it
right away.

426
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,100
Take your time and think it over.

427
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,070
You'll figure it out eventually.

428
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,790
You seem very busy these days.

429
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,420
Yes, things at the company
have been hectic.

430
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,260
Especially with the Dream Resort project.

431
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,600
Mom, did you see
Chef Kang Jun Ho's tattoo?

432
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,830
Even his tattoo is so cool.

433
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,470
I saw he had some strange date tattooed
on the back of his neck.

434
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,440
I wondered if it had some special meaning,
but apparently it's his own birthday.

435
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,810
I guess Chef Kang is pretty narcissistic,

436
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,110
seeing he tattooed his own birthday
on himself.

437
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,650
I heard he got it to cover up some moles.

438
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,420
He has three moles in a row on his neck
that he thought were ugly.

439
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
What?

440
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,030
CEO Chae, is that really so surprising?

441
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,890
(The First Man)

442
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,650
Tell Chef Kang Jun Ho
to come to my office.

443
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,820
Hey, stop. I'm expecting someone.

444
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,030
You two seem to know each other.

445
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,830
Go on the blind date.
She'll be better than that trashy girl.

446
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
- Okay, I will.
- What?

447
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,040
Honey, could you really leave me
for another woman?

448
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,440
Are you kidding me?

449
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,370
Excuse me.

450
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,470
This man is mine.

451
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
