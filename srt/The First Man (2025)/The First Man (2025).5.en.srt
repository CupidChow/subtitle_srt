1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,330
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,930
I'm so sorry you were both born
as my daughters.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,540
But still, please be happy.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,340
Live a long and happy life.

5
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,310
Promise me...

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,540
you'll live a good life.

7
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,680
(Episode 5)

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,290
Let's get out.

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,400
Dad, I don't want any of those rice cakes.

10
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,070
What makes you think
I bought these for you?

11
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
I bought them for the caretaker here.

12
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,280
- Why?
- "Why?"

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,310
Suk Hee was staying here, wasn't she?

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,980
It's just common courtesy
to show our gratitude.

15
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,950
- "Courtesy?"
- Yes.

16
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,690
It just means you can't just accept
anything for free.

17
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,370
Where is that cat meowing from?

18
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,840
Dad, I want to go play with the cat.

19
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,070
What?

20
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,510
All right. Should we go check it out?

21
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,280
Let's go.

22
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,450
What?

23
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,480
That doesn't sound like a cat.

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,530
Wait, why is there a baby here?

25
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,730
What in the world is going on?

26
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Goodness. Let's see.

27
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,840
What's a baby doing here?

28
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,740
Where's your mommy?
Why are you out here crying?

29
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,610
This is the four-leaf clover
Suk Hee crocheted.

30
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,010
What?

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
This is exactly like mine.

32
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,790
Dad, it's just like yours, too!

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,460
Bok Gil.

34
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,890
I hesitated whether
I should tell you this or not...

35
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,600
for a long time.

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,330
There's something that will be
a big surprise for you later.

37
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,440
She's so beautiful that
I want to brag about her,

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,370
but I'll stop myself.

39
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,240
Then could this be the big surprise
she mentioned?

40
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,840
Does it mean she had this baby?

41
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,180
"She's so beautiful that
I want to brag..."

42
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,820
She has to be hers.

43
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,920
She has to be Suk Hee's baby!

44
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
It's done.

45
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,100
She went over with the baby,

46
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,770
so it's done and over with.

47
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,840
Boss, can we take off now?

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Go ahead.

49
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,680
You cleaned the villa,
leaving no traces of us, right?

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes, boss.

51
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,250
Hey. Didn't I tell you
not to drink on the job?

52
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,180
You made this a lot harder
than it should've been.

53
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,790
Let's go.

54
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,990
Suk Hee! Are you in there?

55
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,130
Are you in there?

56
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
Suk Hee!

57
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,460
Are you in there?

58
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,600
Suk Hee!

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,540
Are you in there?

60
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,840
What on earth is going on here?

61
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,380
Well, if this is her baby,

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,210
she wouldn't be in the room...

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,550
with the baby alone in the shed.

64
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,880
What is going on here?

65
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh, all right.

66
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,560
Jung Suk Hee threw herself off a cliff?

67
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Yes.

68
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,160
She was at a dead end anyway.

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,800
What about the baby? The baby too?

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,870
She knew she had to take
the baby with her.

71
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,140
The baby would've had
a miserable life anyway.

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,280
Right. It might be for the best.

73
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,580
We didn't get blood on our hands.

74
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,410
That's right. Our hands are clean.
We did nothing wrong.

75
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,420
It was Jung Suk Hee's choice to die.

76
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,550
Right?

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,090
I'm telling you, Suk Hee was gone,
and only this baby was there.

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,360
In a filthy shed, no less!

79
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,930
Please, you have to find Suk Hee.

80
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,070
You need to find Suk Hee now!

81
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,770
I just spoke with the caretaker
of the villa,

82
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
and he said Ms. Jung Suk Hee
rented the place for a few months...

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,840
and has moved out.

84
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,280
She moved out?
Leaving the baby behind?

85
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,010
Our records show that Ms. Jung Suk Hee
doesn't have any children.

86
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,580
Are you sure she has a daughter?

87
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,120
She's right here. Don't cry. It's okay.

88
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,190
- If she left her child and vanished,
- What do you mean she left her child?

89
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,390
it looks more like she ran away
than went missing.

90
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,860
It was probably too hard
for a single mother to raise a child.

91
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,360
That's ridiculous!

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,400
Suk Hee would never do that!

93
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,670
We'll call you if we hear anything,
so you can go home for now.

94
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,730
But I...

95
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,370
Yes, this is the Buho Police Substation.

96
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,470
- What?
- It's okay.

97
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,570
You're saying a fisherman
found a woman in the water?

98
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,740
A woman?

99
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,960
Here, hold her.

100
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,170
I'll pull the car around.
Take your time coming down.

101
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,280
From now on, no matter what anyone says,

102
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,350
you will live as my daughter.

103
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,180
You'll forget all about your blood ties.

104
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,220
You'll be my daughter
for the rest of your life.

105
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Got it?

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,260
Which baby...

107
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,490
should I take?

108
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,730
All right. We're going to see
your grandfather now.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,470
And when we do,

110
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,410
you'll get to live a life of luxury,
all thanks to me.

111
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,240
So don't you ever cross me.

112
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,180
You will be grateful...

113
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,310
and do exactly as I say.

114
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,120
Forever.

115
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,850
Suk Hee! You guys stay here...

116
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,620
Suk Hee, it's me! I'm here!

117
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,760
- I'm here, Suk Hee...
- Sir, please be quiet.

118
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,360
Where is my Suk Hee?

119
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,130
Suk Hee!

120
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,230
Suk Hee...

121
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,130
Suk Hee!

122
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,070
Suk Hee. What happened to you?

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,840
You were studying for the bar exam.
How'd you fall in the water to get here?

124
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,850
Out of the way!

125
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,550
What? Okay.

126
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,090
- She's in arrest.
- Prepare for CPR, now.

127
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,160
Yes, Doctor.

128
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,430
Suk Hee! Open your eyes!

129
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
You can't go like this.

130
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,930
You've had a hard life with no parents,

131
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,270
so it's too unfair for you to die now.

132
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
You deserve to be successful for once.

133
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,970
That's why you studied so hard
for the bar exam!

134
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,110
- Dad.
- Don't cry.

135
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,440
Family members, please step back.

136
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
Okay.

137
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,950
Suk Hee!

138
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,320
No! Suk Hee!

139
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,320
Father.

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,720
She's your granddaughter.

141
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,720
She's my daughter with Dong Seok.

142
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,090
I see.

143
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,360
So you're Dong Seok's daughter.

144
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,460
Hold her, Father.

145
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,860
All right.

146
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, you're so pretty. Oh, my sweet girl.

147
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,940
It feels like my Dong Seok
has come back to me.

148
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,410
- Father.
- Yes. All right...

149
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,240
- Oh, Suk Hee...
- Charge to 200 joules.

150
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,550
Two hundred joules.

151
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,320
Dad...

152
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,620
Suk Hee...

153
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,990
Please...

154
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,820
- Charge to 250 joules.
- Two hundred fifty joules.

155
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,890
Suk Hee...

156
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Suk Hee.

157
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,330
No.

158
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,930
- Suk Hee...
- No...

159
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,130
Suk Hee.

160
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
No.

161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Suk Hee.

162
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,610
Suk Hee, no!

163
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,860
I've never seen you this happy, Father.

164
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,260
Is that so?

165
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,230
I guess blood ties
really do pull you together.

166
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,500
Still, you should get a DNA test,
just to be sure.

167
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,070
That way, I'll have a clear conscience.

168
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,800
Of course. We have to.

169
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,470
Don't worry.
I'm going to get the DNA test.

170
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,370
Oh my, her hands are so tiny.

171
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,850
Seo Rin, I'm your grandpa.

172
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,050
- Peekaboo.
- Seo Rin?

173
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,250
Yes. "Seo" means auspicious,
and "Rin" means jade.

174
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,220
That's her name. What do you think?

175
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,860
You've already picked out a name for her?

176
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,060
Ma Seo Rin.

177
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,290
It's a beautiful name.

178
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,800
You've been through so much.

179
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,100
Move into the house tomorrow with Seo Rin.

180
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,470
- Into the house?
- Why are you surprised?

181

If you're Seo Rin's mother,
then you're my daughter-in-law.

182
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,710

183
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,580
I'll make that decision
after we get the DNA results, Father.

184

Please, let me do it that way.

185

you before.

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,370
Thank you, Father.

189

I'll move in and make sure...

Seo Rin grows up
to be the best and brightest.

191
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,580

- Yes.

Aren't you going to work?

241
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,530
I sent you out for eggs.
What are you doing, goofing off in here?

242
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,790
Alright, I'm going.

243
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,260
Darn it,
you scarfed down all the eggs, too.

244
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,700
Your sister Jang Mi prepped
the shop earlier...

245
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,240
and left for her part-time job.

246
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,540
But you're just holed up inside,
stuffing your face with eggs...

Gosh, my ears are ringing.

253
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,620
Where's your mother?

254
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,020
What? Isn't she at the store?

255
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,990
She went out right after you left
to buy eggs to go with you.

256
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,360
- I told her to go back in.
- But did you see her go in?

257
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,400
Isn't telling her enough?
Must I walk her in too?

Otherwise, I have no idea where she'd go.

266
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,680
All right, I'll go.

267

isn't answering her phone again.

from the airport.

she can do as she likes.

Sounds like your brother is
nothing like you.

Other than being a handful,

360
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,570
Good. Let's all have dinner together
for a change.

361
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,210
Okay.

362
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,640
I didn't know you were home.

363
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,610
My class was canceled,
so I wrapped up early and came home.

364
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,580
By the way, Jun Ho is back.

365
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,550
I know. He called me.

366
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,690
Does this mean we have to
blow up balloons again?

367
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,360
Baek Ho said he was coming home early
with a gift for his brother.

368
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,260
It's amazing how two brothers
can be so completely different.

369
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,240
That's not my Jang Mi.

370
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,740
I miss my Jang Mi.

371
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,580
Jang Mi said she was bringing me
a birthday present.

372
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,090
My birthday present.

373
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,590
Jang Mi.

374
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,130
It's a gift for my mom.

375
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,070
- What would you recommend?
- For your mother?

376
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,170
How about something like this?

377
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,110
That's beautiful.
Please wrap this up for me.

378
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,050
Mom!

379
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,950
Mom!

380
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,930
Jang Mi.

381
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
What a freak.

382
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,810
Why is a crazy person like you
wandering the streets?

383
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,240
If you're not all there,
you should be locked up at home.

384
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,080
Why are you out here?

385
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,950
I'm not crazy.
I'm looking for my Jang Mi.

386
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,690
Have you seen my Jang Mi?

387
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,720
My Jang Mi.

388
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,690
What do you think you're doing?

389
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,620
You're disgusting.

390
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,530
I'm not disgusting!

391
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,900
I'm going to tell my Jang Mi on you.

392
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,000
You're mean. You're a mean lady.

393
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,170
I can't believe this woman.

394
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,840
Hey, I didn't do anything to her! I swear!

395
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,940
Yes, you did! You pushed me!

396
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,640
You're a mean lady!

397
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,180
You pushed me!

398
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,110
You fell all by yourself!
Why are you blaming me?

399
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,310
What a nutcase.

400
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,620
What are you staring at?
You think this is a show?

401
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,980
Jang Mi...

402
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,660
I just want to see my Jang Mi.

403
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,900
Where is she?
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

404
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,870
- What's her problem?
- What's going on over there?

405
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,370
Will you get out of my way?

406
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,540
You crazy old hag, what is wrong with you?

407
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,110
Take me to my Jang Mi!

408
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,810
Jang Mi! Take me to her!

409
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,550
It looks like there was an accident.

410
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,880
Let go of me.

411
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,420
- I said let go.
- It looks like a fight's breaking out.

412
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,220
I have to get to Jang Mi.

413
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,560
- Take me to her! Please, take me.
- What is wrong with you?

414
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,890
Take me to Jang Mi.

415
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,230
- I said let go!
- Take me to Jang Mi.

416
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,030
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

417
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,570
Dad!

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,970
Is Mom not back yet?

419
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,170
You couldn't find her?
Did you look everywhere?

420
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,270
I told you I did.

421
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,640
- What are we going to do?
- Darn it.

422
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,040
Hey! This is all on you!

423
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,110
- What?
- Go find your mother right now!

424
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,650
Who are you calling?

425
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,290
Don't call Jang Mi.
You'll just make her worry.

426
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,120
- Hey, Jang Mi. Mom's missing.
- Seriously, you!

427
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,820
- I swear I told her to go inside.
- Give me that.

428
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,160
- Hang on!
- You little punk!

429
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,560
- Dad, wait!
- Tae Pyung.

430
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,960
What did you say about Mom?

431
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,330
What?
Don't tell me she got lost again.

432
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,930
How could you let this happen?

433
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,900
I thought I told you
not to let Mom go out alone!

434
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,580
She was at that park last time, remember?

435
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,020
Go check there.

436
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,520
I'm on my way.

437
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,060
Call me if anything happens.

438
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

439
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,560
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

440
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,570
(The First Man)

441
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,970
The police substation just called.

442
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,380
I flagged him first.

443
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,240
- What are you talking about?
- Are you going to let go or not?

444
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,350
- I'm not letting go.
- You've got to be kidding me.

445
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,380
Who do you take after,
lying so shamelessly like that?

446
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,350
Ma Seo Rin, don't forget
that you owe everything you have to me.

447
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,090
- It's so cute.
- Is that really for Mom?

448
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
- I think they got switched.
- What's going on here?

449
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,400
I swear I'll hunt that jerk down
and make him pay.

450
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,970
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
