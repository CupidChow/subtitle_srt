Mr. Su and Miss Li,

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,150
what friends are you?

25
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,590
Why are you waiting until now to tell us?

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,400
Yeah. Such bad friends.

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,680
Oh, I know.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
They must have planned

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,200
to give us a surprise.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Right?

31
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,560
I feel I'm about to cry.

32
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,400
Why would you?

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
Our central pillar is back.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,430
From this day on, we'll have a backer.

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,640
But yesterday, you said

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,590
I was your strong backer.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,590
Come on.

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,640
Don't always count on Miss Ji.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
Whether she is or she is not here,

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
you have to be strong.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Miss Li and Mr. Su,

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,560
we get your point.

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Don't worry.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,120
We'll let Miss Ji know.

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,280
When she was away,

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
Xingchen lived up to her expectations.

47
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,030
- Right.
- Yes.

48
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,080
All right. Get back to work.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,800
Oh, Zuo.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Check this.

51
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
Look.

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
I have no more problems.

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Mr. Han, do you have anything else to say?

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,680
Let's call it a day.

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Thanks for your hard work.

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,990
Mr. Han.

57
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,520
This...

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,590
Ji Xing.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Pick a card.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
If I can change

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
this card,

62
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,000
will you promise me one thing?

63
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,030
OK.

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,660

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,060

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,470
Let's go. To Lang Canteen.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Come on.

68
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
OK.

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
I should go.

70
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,080
Boss,

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,400
Miss Tan Yuni invited you to lunch.

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,630
She has reserved a room for you

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,680
in Lang Canteen.

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,710
Will you go?

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,470
Can you do magic?

76
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,780
(Lang Canteen)

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,150
The talent pool is a hard job.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,360
But I love

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
such challenging jobs.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Especially when I work with you.

81
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,750
I look forward to our partnership.

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,640
We'll have lunch

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
to celebrate my return to Hanhai Xingchen

84
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,390
and your return to China.

85
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,800
When I think

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
after I'm back in China,

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,430
I'll have my first meal with you,

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,630
I feel a little bit unreal.

89
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,190
When you're flooded with work,

90
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,870
you'll feel what is real.

91
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,360
- See?
- I'll order a lot, then.

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,240
The guest upstairs

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
is the superstar Tan Yuni.

94
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,070
I wonder who she'll dine with.

95
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,510
Yeah. Over the phone,

96
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,830
she mentioned Mr. Han.

97
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,160
He must be a big boss.

98
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,230
Mr. Han?

99
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,510
It can't be Han Ting, huh?

100
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,300
(Lang)

101
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,920
- Thanks.
- OK. Just a minute.

102
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,120
This canteen is quite special.

103
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait a minute.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
Open it and see.

105
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,270
How did you do that?

106
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,160
(Movie: Miss Him)
You haven't replied.

107
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,000
Will you watch the movie premiere with me?

108
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,110
Sorry.

109
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,070
I just joined Hanhai Xingchen.

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,870
I have a lot of work to do.

111
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,620
(Lang Canteen)

112
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,310
Work is important.

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,720
You need a private life, too.

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Before you have fun,

115
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,310
how can you be motivated to work?

116
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,600
If you don't hate me,

117
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
spending some time with me

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
when you're not working

119
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,430
can be a really nice choice.

120
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,000
Thanks for reminding me.

121
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
I will relax properly.

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,830
But now, I don't want anyone

123
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,750
in my private life.

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,360
You reject me really relentlessly.

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Is it because of...?

126
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,670
Han Ting?

127
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,560
You still love him.

128
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,310
But it doesn't mean you won't get over him.

129
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,560
You and I will spend

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
a lot of time together.

131
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,510
I can have a fair play with him.

132
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,000
I think we can just be friends.

133
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,590
OK.

134
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,870
Let's be friends for now.

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Lady and gentleman,

136
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,030
excuse me.

137
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Let me serve the dishes.

138
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
Hello, Assistant Tang.

139
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,310
Have you and Mr. Han arrived?

140
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,430
Miss Tan, sorry.

141
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,800
Mr. Han suddenly has a video conference.

142
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,270
He can't go there.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
Fine, then.

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,390
Since Mr. Han is occupied,

145
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,720
I'll invite him another day.

146
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,360
Thanks, Assistant Tang.

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Not at all.

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Mr. Han asked me

149
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
to order a flower stand.

150
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,360
It will be sent to the scene of your premiere.

151
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,870
Wish you a smooth premiere

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
and a box office smash.

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,720
I appreciate it.

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
This is a really good canteen.

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
Glad you like it.

156
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
I was worried the food
would not agree with you.

157
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,550
I came back to China several times

158
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
but had terrible meals.

159
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,910
You can pick such good food.

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
Take me with you when you dine.

161
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll follow you.

162
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,000
Such a good trick.

163
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,960
You can see it through, anyway.

164
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,270
Mr. Han, thanks for your flowers.

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
For the premiere later,

166
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,550
come if you have time.

want to travel to Xinggang for a few days

and we'll bring you some local food.

OK. I can reschedule my work.

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,150
No, of course.

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,870
Well, after you buy the flight tickets,

192
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,960
text me the info. I'll go pick you up.

193
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,990
OK.

194
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,360
- Bye-bye.
- OK. Bye-bye.

195
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,700
(Hanhai Xingchen)

196
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,510
Mr. Luo.

197
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,270
Miss Ji, how can I help you?

198
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,280
Take your seat.

199
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,870
Mr. Luo, I want to take one day off.

200
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,870
You're the vice president.
You don't need to ask me.

201
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,320
You can arrange for it yourself.

202
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,630
Don't you fear I'll slack?

203
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,320
You're a famous workaholic.

204
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,440
It's good that you relax sometimes.

205
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,470
Oh.

206
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,840
You really need to take some good rest

207
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,030
and store up energy.

208
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,480
You'll have a long journey.

209
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,960
You'll send me on a business trip?

210
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,110
Where shall I go?

211
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
In a few days,

212
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Shenzhen AI in Healthcare Expo &amp; Forum

213
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,670
will be held.

214
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,440
It's the invitation from the organizer.

215
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,080
An invitation for me?

216
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Open it and see.

217
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,180
(Distinguished Miss Ji Xing...)

218
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,740
(The 4th Shenzhen AI Medical Summit Forum)

219
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,790
(If you're sure to go,)

220
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
(reply before tomorrow noon.)

221
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,720
It's been a whole year

222
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,480
since the last summit forum.

223
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,870
Last year, I went there
without my own invitation.

224
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
This year, you have a different identity.

225
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,670
You're rightfully invited.

226
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,840
Maybe next year,

227
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,080
you'll even be invited

228
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
to give a speech.

229
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Hope so, Mr. Luo.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,960
All right. Go back and prepare for the forum.

231
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,550
I will. Thanks.

232
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,630
Miss Ji has an emergency meeting.

233
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,750
So, I'm told to bring you here

234
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,080
and you can wait for her.

235
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,840
Thank you.

236
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
Xu.

237
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,870
They're Miss Ji's parents.

238
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,200
Take them to her office

239
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,080
where they can wait.

240
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,350
OK.

241
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,560
Thanks.

242
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,510
(Hanhai Xingchen)
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

243
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,910
Miss Ji is having a meeting

244
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,910
in the meeting room next door.

245
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,870
Let me take you

246
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,270
to her own office.

247
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,320
Miss,

248
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,030
are they having a meeting here?

249
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,630
Yes.

250
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,720
Can we take a look?

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,510
- Umm...
- We won't disturb them. Just one look.

252
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,320
Fine, then.

253
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,790
- This way.
- Thanks.

254
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,420
(Industry Status)

255
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,270
Take us to her office now.

256
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,510
Come with me.

257
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
Let's go.

258
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,030
It's so great.

259
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,200
Look.

260
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,630
Are all these guys here

261
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,440
our daughter's subordinates?

262
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,870
Mr. and Mrs. Ji,

263
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,000
please wait here for Miss Ji.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,840
I'll go out.

265
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,080
- OK.
- OK. Thanks.

266
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,260
(Vice President's Office)

267
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,910
Dahuang is quite chubby.

268
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,150
It must have eaten a lot.

269
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,240
Ji, come and look. The sea.

270
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,750
It's so beautiful.

271
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,600
Behave yourself.

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,150
It's the glass wall.

273
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,480
They can see us.

274
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,240
They're all busy with work.

275
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,870
They have no time to look at you.

276
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,320
Never in my wildest dreams did I think

277
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,680
my daughter

278
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,630
could have such a big office.

279
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,030
It's not a surprise

280
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,120
what a big difference

281
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,150
our daughter can make.

282
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,960
It depends on whether she wants it.

283
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
It's you who always asked her

284
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,630
not to work too hard, huh?

285
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,550
That's right.

286
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,240
Think about our daughter.

287
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,240
She's so decent now.

288
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,840
She appears to be decent,

289
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,270
but she must have suffered a lot.

290
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,630
In such a big city,

291
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,670
she's been fighting all alone.

292
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,390
Behind her success,

293
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,030
there must be a lot of hardships.

294
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,480
This is really hard.

295
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,840
She hasn't complained to us.

296
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,480
But as her mother,

297
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
I can see that.

298
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
Yeah.

299
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,550
When Xing is here,

300
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,630
don't say stuff like this.

301
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,720
You know.

302
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,630
Our daughter has high self-esteem.

303
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
I know.

304
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,080
I just want our daughter

305
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,320
to be a happy ordinary girl.

306
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,600
And I want her to have someone

307
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,670
who can take care of her.

308
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,510
You're right.

309
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,270
We just don't know

310
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,080
what is going on

311
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,110
with her and Han.

312
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,080
Dad. Mom.

313
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,320
Dad.

314
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,510
Oh, boss,

315
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,750
is the meeting over?

316
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,870
Don't make fun of me.

317
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,550
Take your seats.

318
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,600
What? Is the trip tiring?

319
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,750
Not at all.

320
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,440
Young men

321
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,280
and your ladies here

322
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,830
really respect us.

323
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,070
You have such a big office.

324
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
Impressive, indeed.

325
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,110
We're an industry-leading company.

326
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,480
And I'm the vice president.

327
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,640
So, I have a better offer.

328
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,680
I have to be busier, too.

329
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,640
That's right.

330
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,910
Good.

331
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,960
But don't be arrogant

332
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,800
for your achievements.

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,920
You must remain modest

334
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,320
and keep working hard.

335
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,640
Ignore your father.

336
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't always think of work.

337
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,310
Work isn't everything in your life.

338
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,960
You must eat and sleep regularly

339
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,110
and stay healthy.

340
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,310
That's the most important thing.

341
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,440
If you break down,

342
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,070
you'll have nothing.

343
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,110
I know. Don't worry.

344
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,320
Umm...

345
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,720
What is Han up to?

346
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,920
We haven't seen him for a long time.

347
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,110
Yeah.

348
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,110
He...

349
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,350
He's busier.

350
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,510
Much busier than me.

351
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,920
How about this?

352
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,680
Your father

353
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
has an old soldier buddy

354
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,880
who also lives in Xinggang.

355
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,310
When he knew we were here,

356
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,480
he invited us to dinner.

357
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,310
Since you're busy,

358
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,030
we'll have dinner with him tonight. OK, Ji?

359
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,510
OK. Just tonight.

360
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,310
Your mother and I won't disturb you.

361
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,240
Not at all.

362
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,590
You have to work.

363
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Don't be distracted.

364
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,110
Not at all.

365
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,560
Say no more.

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,880
Fine, then.

367
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,030
Let the driver get you there.

368
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,520
No need.

369
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,030
Just drive us to the hotel.

370
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,400
Don't bother tonight.

371
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,440
We can walk there.

372
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Here.

373
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,720
Your favorite chicken wings.

374
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,390
And this...

375
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,830
You'll work overtime, right?

376
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,160
Share the food with your colleagues.

377
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,590
Is it from the Chen's?

378
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,240
Yes, from your favorite restaurant.

379
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,070
Quite a lot of food.

380
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,310
Share it with your colleagues.

381
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,270
When dinner is over,

382
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,110
call me.

383
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,830
- OK. We'll go.
- We should go.

384
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,110
Be careful on the road.

385
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
- Sure.
- Don't worry about us.

386
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,390
Here.

387
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,400
Eat this.

388
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,560
What's wrong?

389
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,110
Does the food taste bad?

390
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,640
No.

391
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,590
I just...

392
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,550
I don't have an appetite.

393
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,590
Look on the bright side.

394
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,720
Ms. Han is optimistic and kind.

395
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,550
She will be fine.

396
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
But she can't even get out of bed now.

397
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,200
Let me give you a tip.

398
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,720
I've heard people say

399
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,510
when someone gets something on his mind,

400
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,960
he will find a hidey-hole

401
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,920
and tell all his sad,

402
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,830
and unhappy stories

403
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,640
to the hidey-hole.

404
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,440
Then, he can relax.

405
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,350
Now,

406
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,720
I can be your hidey-hole.

407
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,870
No, thanks.

408
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,310
You eat, too.

409
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Do you know what fruit has no peel?

410
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,720
Watermelon?

411
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,160
Grape?

412
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
No, no.

413
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,510
Strawberry, raspberry, and waxberry.

414
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,720
Homophones?

415
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,000
Such a poor homophonic joke.

416
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,590
Actually,

417
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,550
I don't mean to tell a joke.

418
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,160
Instead, I want to tell you.

419
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,350
I suffered online bullying.

420
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,200
But I got over it.

421
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,640
You told jokes to me,

422
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,000
comforted me, and asked me to be optimistic.

423
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,270
Why does it not work

424
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
with you now?

425
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,920
Do you remember what you said to me?

426
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,200
You said, "Let's just deal with trouble."

427
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,000
Xiaomeng.

428
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,800
Thank you.

429
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,310
Not at all.

430
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,400
When I was in trouble,

431
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,720
you kept me company.

432
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Now, Ms. Han is sick.

433
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,310
I'll keep you company, too.

434
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,190
Besides,

435
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,510
Ms. Han is so nice to me.

436
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,720
I'll take her as my godmother.

437
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,920
We'll take care of her together.

438
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,840
OK?

439
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,960
Come on. Eat some more.

440
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,270
Take good care of yourself

441
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,920
and then you can look after your mother.

442
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,790
This.

443
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,080
You eat, too.

444
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
OK.

445
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,960
Mr. Ji, have some tea.

446
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,910
Thanks.

447
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,350
You're welcome.

448
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,550
Have some tea, Mrs. Ji.

449
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
OK. Thanks.

450
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,830
I don't know what you like to eat.

451
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,350
So, I ordered some casual dishes.

452
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Let's eat and talk.

453
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,960
Han, have you been busy lately?

454
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,640
No, not really.

455
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,480
Mr. and Mrs. Ji,

456
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,030
what have you come

457
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,920
to see me about?

458
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,240
Well, here is the thing.

459
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
During the Chinese New Year,

460
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,070
why did you not come to our place?

461
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,080
I...

462
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,880
At that time, Xing and I

463
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,070
had a little problem.

464
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
So now, what is...?

465
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,680
Come on.

466
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,830
Don't beat around the bush.

467
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,310
Han, what is your relationship

468
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,640
with Xing now?

469
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,200
We...

470
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,800
We broke up.

471
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
When?

472
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,910
Before the Chinese New Year.

473
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,830
Oh, I see.

474
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,720
During the Chinese New Year,

475
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
you didn't come with her.

476
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,590
We thought

477
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,550
you only had a little problem.

478
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,030
So, you broke up at that time.

479
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,110
It was my fault.

480
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,880
Han,

481
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,110
tell me

482
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,960
why you broke up.

483
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,660
(Xingyue Club)

484
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,720
I was being insensitive about Hanhai's case.

485
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,750
I didn't confess to her in time.

486
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,320
I'm sorry.

487
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,720
Don't say that.

488
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,720
We don't understand

489
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,110
your plans or layouts

490
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,480
in business.

491
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,640
But when there's something wrong with love,

492
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,950
both parties are to blame, right?

493
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,240
You may think Xing doesn't understand you.

494
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,960
But I'm her mother.

495
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,270
I know her very well.

496
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,030
Now, Xing

497
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,350
works for Hanhai Xingchen.

498
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,070
It means she no longer blames you.

499
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,950
Do you get it?

500
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Han,

501
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,440
thanks for explaining all this.

502
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,350
Her mother and I worried so much

503
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,110
that we came to see her.

504
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,670
Mr. Ji,

505
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,080
and Mrs. Ji,

506
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,030
I still

507
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,960
love Ji Xing.

508
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,350
Han,

509
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,110
our daughter

510
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,640
has always been stubborn.

511
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,070
She doesn't show weakness.

512
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,830
And so far,

513
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
you've been split for such a long time.

514
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,920
Do you think

515
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,440
you can get back together?

516
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
You ended up separated

517
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,750
because you had a problem.

518
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,350
Even if one day,

519
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,830
you get back together,

520
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,350
you'll have the same problem.

521
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,720
As her parents,

522
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,110
we don't interfere with your love thing.

523
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,720
However,

524
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
if you really

525
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,510
want Xing back,

526
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,720
I hope you can figure out something.

527
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,480
When you have a problem again,

528
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,790
which one of you will concede?

529
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,720
We don't want her to be hurt again.

530
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,940
(Marshmallow)

531
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,640
- Here.
- Thanks.

532
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
What flavor do you want?

533
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,110
Whatever! It's up to you!

534
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,480
Strawberry flavor, please.

535
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,030
OK. Strawberry, right?

536
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,280
Hey, Ji.

537
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,750
Should we ask Xing about Han?

538
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,240
No. She knows what she should do.

539
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,030
Let's not bother her.

540
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,880
Fine, then.

541
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,550
She looks good, anyway.

542
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,550
Forget it. As long as she's happy.

543
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,390
Come on.

544
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,480
- OK?
- OK. Good.

545
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Here. The strawberry flavor.

546
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,510
Are you tired?

547
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Not at all.

548
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,160
Fine. Let's go take the yacht.

549
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,190
Sure.

550
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,440
She's quite happy.

551
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,880
- Let's go.
- Come on.

552
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
Have you had fun?

553
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,880
Yes. So much fun.

554
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,110
Next time, I'll take you
to neighboring regions.

555
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,030
You must be very tired.

556
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm not.

557
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,110
Xing,

558
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,070
here's the thing.

559
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,000
Your father and I

560
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,830
discussed it and we decided

561
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,310
to ask you.

562
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,160
What is it?

563
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,720
Before,

564
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,070
we said we would meet
an old buddy of your father's.

565
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,270
Actually, we went to see Han.

566
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,910
Exactly.

567
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,070
Your mother and I know

568
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,240
what happened between you.

569
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,720
What did he say to you?

570
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,110
He said

571
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,830
he was sorry.

572
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
I didn't tell you what happened

573
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,510
in case you would worry about me.

574
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,270
Yeah. We can understand.

575
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Actually, Xing,

576
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,750
whether you have a boyfriend

577
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,880
does not matter.

578
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,070
We just want you to be happy.

579
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,350
Xing.

580
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,920
Remember. Whatever happens,

581
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,440
your mother and I will always love you.

582
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
I know.

583
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm fine.

584
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,000
You've arrived?

585
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,030
OK. We'll be right there.

586
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,510
The driver is here. Let's go.

587
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,720
OK. Come on.

588
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,590
Just don't worry.

589
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,750
I know what I should do

590
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,920
with Han Ting.

591
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,830
I'll handle our relationship.

592
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,000
That's good.

593
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,270
Our daughter

594
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,830
has grown up.

595
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm forever your daughter, though.

596
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,480
I've finally sent him away.

597
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,640
Hey, Lu Linjia.

598
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,590
You're going out?

599
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,790
Yes. To buy some fruit.

600
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,680
No need. I've bought some.

601
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,440
And a bouquet.

602
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,070
I think

603
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,720
when Ms. Han can't get out of bed,

604
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,000
seeing more beautiful things

605
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,030
will get her happier.

606
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,350
Thanks. It's so sweet of you.

607
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,640
- Let's go.
- OK.

608
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,480
Come on.

609
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,480
Can you ride smoothly?

610
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
Come on.

611
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,200
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

612
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,510
Hey, Liu.

613
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,110
I have one last packet of spicy sticks.

614
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,750
Tomorrow, buy some more for me.

615
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,270
I have light meals every day.

616
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
I won't have an appetite

617
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,770
without the spicy sticks.

618
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,350
Did you tell me

619
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,160
too many spicy sticks will get me fatter?

620
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,630
Never mind.

621
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,510
Let it be.

622
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,270
For my son's happy life,

623
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,960
I'll just bear it.

624
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,550
I'll just be fat but happy.

625
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,790
When do you think I can stop pretending?

626
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,920
My legs are nearly useless.

627
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,000
Mom, what are you doing?

628
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
Ms. Han.

629
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,550
Liu,

630
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,400
don't buy spicy sticks.

631
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,960
Come to work tomorrow.

632
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,870
Give it to me.

633
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,720
Confess, Ms. Han.

634
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,310
What's all this about?

635
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,310
Due to low blood sugar,

636
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,480
I really fainted.

637
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,400
And then?

638
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,560
Then...

639
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,240
Then you're to blame.

640
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,480
How long have you been

641
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,350
pursuing Miss Xiaomeng?

642
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,270
No progress at all.

643
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,350
I was so anxious.

644
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,440
I had to do something to bring you together.

645
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,790
Ms. Han, this is ridiculous!

646
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,160
How could you do this?

647
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,070
If you scared me to death,

648
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,030
who would you bring together?

649
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,550
Son, don't say that.

650
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,720
Come on. Spit it out.

651
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,640
Just do it.

652
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,840
Sit back there.

653
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,670
Ms. Han,

654
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,310
we've been so worried about you.

655
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
When you're all right, we'll be relieved.

656
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,750
Miss Xiaomeng, I'm really sorry.

657
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,960
I was just too anxious.

658
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,400
You won't blame me, will you?

659
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,160
I won't, Ms. Han.

660
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,480
Since you're all right,

661
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,790
I should go back home.

662
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
Miss Xiaomeng, don't go.

663
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,030
Stay for a bit longer.

664
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,550
I'd better go, Ms. Han.

665
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,400
Oh, Miss Xiaomeng.

666
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,030
Come often.

667
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,350
OK. I'll come when I have time.

668
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,550
Thanks for your bouquet!

669
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,030
What are you waiting for?

670
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,640
Catch up and see her out.

671
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,790
Such an insensitive boy.

672
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
Fine. My trick isn't in vain.

673
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,030
Neither are the spicy sticks.

674
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,220
(Stay Always Safe)

675
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,960
I should go.

676
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,200
My mother loves to worry about nothing.

677
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,960
She did something so silly.

678
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Umm...

679
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,590
Thanks for coming lately.

680
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,270
It's OK. Don't worry.

681
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,030
Glad Ms. Han is healthy.

682
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,310
Smart Lemon.

683
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,510
For the sake of my mother's hard work,

684
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,310
will you still not

685
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,400
change your mind?

686
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,110
What are you talking about?

687
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,750
Pestering isn't my style.

688
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,510
I'm asking you one last time.

689
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,720
Do you have feelings for me?

690
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,400
If you think I have defects, I can change.

691
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,480
You have plenty of defects.

692
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,790
I can't finish listing all day and night.

693
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,000
Fine, then.

694
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
I get it.

695
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,920
But you have many merits, too.

696
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,030
You're righteous, optimistic, and kind-hearted.

697
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,190
Such qualities are good enough

698
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,510
to make up for your defects.

699
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,710
What do you mean?

700
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,440
You make me confused.

701
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,360
If you don't understand, fine.

702
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,990
So...

703
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,150
You like me, huh?

704
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,670
You'll have a trial basis.

705
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,150
OK. No problem.

706
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Try me.

707
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,400
Try anything you want.

708
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm sure I'll be your boyfriend soon.

709
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,640
I...

710
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,430
Dahuang,

711
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,960
tomorrow is your birthday.

712
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,760
What gift do you want?

713
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,960
You also want to see her, huh?

714
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
(Han Ting)

715
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,980
(Watch this.)

716
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,220
(Come on. Let's fight.)

717
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,900
(Watch my cat punch.)

718
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,100
(Humph. I can defeat you.)

719
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,020
(Tomorrow is my birthday.
Can you celebrate it with me?)

720
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,100
(WeChat, Notification)

721
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,150
Every year before,

722
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,550
you celebrated Dahuang's birthday.

723
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,150
Hope you won't be absent this year.

724
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,510
Dahuang, do you think she'll come?

725
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,860
(Ji Xing)

726
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,720
OK.

727
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,710
Come on. Go have some tinned food.

728
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Dahuang.

729
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,070
What's wrong?

730
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,200
Dahuang.

731
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,070
Hey, Dahuang.

732
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,190
Long time no see.

733
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,320
I missed you so much.

734
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,710
You've prepared so much?

735
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,110
I guess you want to stay longer with Dahuang.

736
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,110
So, I prepared some food.

737
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760
Dahuang, did you miss me?

738
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,640
Pretty much.

739
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,590
On the New Year's Eve,

740
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
we sent you a New Year message together.

741
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
Thanks.

742
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,840
Oh, I brought you a birthday hat

743
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
and an apron.

744
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,230
Come on. Let me put it on you.

745
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,400
Dahuang, why are you not coming out?

746
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,320
Are you mad at me?

747
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,990
Let me help you.

748
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,110
Come out.

749
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,920
Do you like it?

750
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,110
Come on. I'll put it on you.

751
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,960
Adorable.

752
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,630
Happy birthday.

753
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,760
Here.

754
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,030
Thanks.

755
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,190
You made this cake?

756
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,960
With its favorite ingredients.

757
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,160
I was worried

758
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,710
that I couldn't take good care of it.

759
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,280
So, I read some books

760
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,670
about looking after cats.

761
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,510
And I learned to cook cat food.

762
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,000
You've been raising it very well.

763
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,190
We met Dahuang together.

764
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,760
I'm obligated to take care of it.

765
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,150
Oh, today is its birthday.

766
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,880
I've got a cake for you, too.

767
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,150
For me?

768
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,720
Here.

769
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,600
Thanks.

770
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,760
Spoon.

771
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
The other day, my parents

772
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,960
went to see you, right?

773
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
Yes.

774
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,150
I'm sorry.

775
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,190
During the Chinese New Year,

776
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,510
in order not to upset them,

777
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,630
I didn't tell them.

778
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,200
It's OK.

779
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,320
I'm grateful to have this chance

780
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,000
to explain everything to them

781
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,320
and apologize.

782
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,230
You don't need to apologize.

783
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,480
But I broke their daughter's heart.

784
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,550
They never want you to get hurt.

785
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,910
Nor do I.

786
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,440
The cat teaser...

787
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,800
It isn't broken yet?

788
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,150
Well, it was broken.

789
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,360
I bought a new one.

790
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,200
Dahuang didn't like it.

791
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
Because you bought the old one.

792
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,760
Maybe it has your smell on it.

793
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,550
So, I fixed the old one.

794
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,390
It's still available now.

795
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,630
You're quite nostalgic, cat.

796
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,190
Shall I take a photo of you and Dahuang?

797
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,160
OK.

798
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,070
Come on. Let's take a photo.

799
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,820
(Dongyang Group)

800
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,190
(Zhu's Medical Instrument may have huge bribes.
His case will be tried soon.)

801
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,760
You know what?

802
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,230
Zhu's Medical Instrument

803
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,710
will go through a trial in a couple of days.

804
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,800
Is Zhu Houyu still detained?

805
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,760
He's remanded in custody, I guess.

806
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,760
Anyway, he'll lose his freedom soon.

807
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,840
I hear after he's convicted,

808
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,230
he'll go to jail.

809
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,710
Anyway, his company

810
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,710
is completely ruined.

811
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,710
I wonder who he offended.

812
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,920
Merciless, indeed.

813
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,150
He broke the law first.

814
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,630
You're right.

815
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,550
I heard some suppliers

816
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,760
talk about this.

817
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,110
They said

818
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,840
if they were Zhu Houyu,

819
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,880
they would perish

820
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,800
with the man behind this.

821
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,800
Such rubbernecks.

822
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,000
It's done.

823
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,720
I should go.
