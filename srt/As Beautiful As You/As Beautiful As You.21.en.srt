00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,600
The other day, when I talked with my grandpa,

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,950
he said you were running Dongyang

99
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,390
rather smoothly.

100
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,600
So, here in Germany,

101
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,040
you would play for a few days

102
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
to relax yourself.

103
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,310
I bet him

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,160
that you would have

105
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,800
a very full schedule.

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Congratulations.

107
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,160
Since when were you

108
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,680
interested in such little things.

109
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,920
It's from a friend.

110
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,190
Looks like this friend

111
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,310
doesn't know much about you.

112
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,560
You don't drink at all.

113
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,190
It's late.

114
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
I'm going to sleep.

115
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,390
You go back, too.

116
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,070
OK. You rest early.

117
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,560
Good night.

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,360

I saw Zeng Di post

119
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,000

120
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,030

121
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,440

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
Nothing. Just some fun.

124
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Any better?

125
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,720
Much better.

126
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,480
You have a digestion problem.

127
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't eat spicy food or drink too much.

128
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,480
What does it have to do

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,870
with spicy food or wine?

130
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,600
It's just the old problem.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,080
You get some more sleep here.

132
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,720
I'll go get you some porridge.

133
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,510
I don't want it.

134
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,750
Come on.

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,550
You had serious diarrhea.

136
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,550
If you don't eat, you'll feel worse.

137
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
Just talk with me for a while.

138
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,720
Fine. I'll stay.

139
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,030
My stomach flu is actually chronic.

140
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,270
I've had it since I was little.

141
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,200
When you were little,

142
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,150
how could you have a stomach flu?

143
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,360
My parents divorced when I was little.

144
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,790
I lived with my mother.

145
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,000
She was too busy working

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
to take care of my meals.

147
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
Every time I felt sick,

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,320
I just sucked it up.

149
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,720
At that time, I was thinking.

150
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,870
Would there be someone

151
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,550
who took good care of me?

152
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,630
Would I have a family

153
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
full of love?

154
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,960
I used to think it was far away from me.

155
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,750
But now,

156
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,360
I think I kind of have it.

157
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,630
Silly girl.

158
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,670
I'll take good care of you.

159
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,480
Such a good teacher.

160
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
Ms. Han,

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
you're making bigger progress.

162
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
I am?

163
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Your breathing problem has improved.

164
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
- Really?
- Impressive.

165
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
- Have some water.
- Come on.

166
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,270
Have some water.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
- OK.
- Have some water.

168
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,840
When you're indoors,

169
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
why do you still wear such fancy clothes?

170
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
That's not true.

171
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,630
You didn't come back until midnight, huh?

172
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,030
Why do you not get more sleep?

173
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,120
When I'm doing business,

174
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm energetic and vigorous.

175
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,870
You call that business?

176
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,030
I think you should put your time

177
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,000
in the right place.

178
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,480
For example...

179
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,910
For example, get a girlfriend

180
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,150
and enjoy a love relationship.

181
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,670
Don't always focus on your bar.

182
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,320
So frivolous.

183
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,270
Ms. Han, every trade has its master.

184
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,480
Why does running a bar make me frivolous?

185
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,320
That's right, Ms. Han.

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
I'd like to be Lu Linjia's witness.

187
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,080
I visited his bar.

188
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
He put a lot of effort.

189
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,320
He's running it very well.

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,480
Don't put in a good word for him.

191
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,030
Think of Han Ting.

192
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,150
He's only a few years older.

193
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,720
But he's young, steady, and mature.

194
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,270
If I don't compare them, fine.

195
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,230
When I compare them,

196
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,750
I'm really pissed off.

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,080
Ms. Han,

198
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,910
I have to argue over this.

199
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,870
My nephew invested in my bar.

200
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Would a mature man

201
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,390
invest any money

202
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,230
in a frivolous guy?

203
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,350
Besides,

204
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,870
he checked on my bar on the opening day.

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,270
He had no problem with it.

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,390
Before you even visit it,

207
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,360
don't give me any advice.

208
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,120
He's just showing respect.

209
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you really think you do a good job?

210
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,350
Ms. Han.

211
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,440
You have some tea first.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,080
When the soup is done,

213
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
have some soup.

214
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,750
OK. Thanks, Ms. Han.

215
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,550
I watched your live streaming the other day.

216
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,550
Is your mic not working very well?

217
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,000
That's true. So, sometimes,

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,080
I use the mic of my phone.

219
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,270
What? The effect isn't bad, huh?

220
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
It's good.

221
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,390
I've bought an extra mic.

222
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,870
How about you use it?

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,670
Or it would only be idle.

224
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,840
Use it before you buy a new one.

225
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,840
Don't stand on ceremony.

226
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,030
Now, we're good friends.

227
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Fine, then.

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,680
Thank you.

229
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,630
Deal. I'll send it to you later.

230
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
OK.

231
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,510
Have some strawberries.

232
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,030
- Are they washed?
- Yes.

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
Here.

234
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,100
(Yushan Bypass No.3)

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,030
This light is fun.

236
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,150
What is it used for?

237
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,750
It's a fill light.

238
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,870
It can brighten the screen

239
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,000
and remove shadow from my face.

240
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,960
What about this? What's it for?

241
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,150
This? It's the mood lighting.

242
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,120
I think it's perfect

243
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
for this backdrop.

244
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
A great atmosphere for my live-streaming room.

245
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,680
It's lighting?

246
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,710
What about this?

247
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
DJ set? For DJ music?

248
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,630
Not at all. It's a sound card.

249
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,080
During the live streaming, it avoids noise.

250
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,200
But it's not used

251
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
for pitch correction.

252
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,670
So, this is where

253
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,840
you usually do live streaming?

254
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,960
I do the makeup, adjust the lighting, and...

255
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,150
Here it goes.

256
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,340
(Smart Lemon)

257
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I look handsome.

258
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,870
Are you beautifying it?

259
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,480
Look at your chin.

260
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,720
What are you talking about?

261
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,030
Come on. You can leave.

262
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,710
Xiaomeng.

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,670
Are you available these days?

264
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,630
I'll take you to dinner.

265
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,440
Why would we eat alone?

266
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,350
No, thanks.

267
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,550
I just want

268
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,550
to discuss with you

269
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,510
the bar stuff.

270
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,960
I want to know what girls like.

271
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,150
After all, only when I capture

272
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,840
the heart of independent ladies like you

273
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,960
who live ahead of their time

274
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,990
can I get the pulse of business, right?

275
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,750
Don't flatter me.

276
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,080
- I'm not flatter...
- OK.

277
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,270
Call me if you need any help at work.

278
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
It's a deal.

279
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
All right. You may leave.

280
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,270
Not until I install the mic.

281
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,590
Come on.

282
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,800
Han Ting.

283
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,360
I knew you would have breakfast

284
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
at this time of day.

285
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,750
I've ordered some for you.

286
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,440
Thanks.

287
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,840
It's all your favorite food.

288
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,480
Yesterday, on my way to the hotel,

289
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
I was watching the scenery.

290
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
I really miss the old days

291
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
where we studied together in Germany.

292
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,320
When you're done working,

293
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,270
show me around Dongyang Base.

294
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,750
I haven't been there for a long time.

295
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,000
If you want to go,

296
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,510
I'll have someone entertain you.

297
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,160
OK.

298
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,360
(Gorgeous Li Li)
No rush to come back.

299
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,360
Spend more days with your Mr. Han.

300
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
(Ji Xing)
Don't tease me.

301
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,080
Here. The menu.

302
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,960
This.

303
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,150
Thank you.

304
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,110
Let me taste your bacon.

305
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,880
If it tastes good,

306
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,790
I'll order one, too.

307
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,350
Taste this.

308
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,480
The sausage tastes like what we had

309
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,550
in our school cafeteria.

310
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,190
Doesn't it?

311
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,950
Yes, a little bit.

312
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,320
Thank you.

313
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,510
Ji Xing, the vehicle has arrived.

314
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,440
Let's go.

315
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,950
Coming.

316
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,110
Looks like you don't like bacon.

317
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,590
You only showed that to Ji Xing.

318
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,070
Don't play such tricks anymore.

319
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,350
Han Ting.

320
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,310
I don't understand.

321
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,720
We've known each other since childhood.

322
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,070
You know I've been adoring you.

323
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,400
Including family background and capability,

324
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,680
I can help you in every aspect.

325
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,200
We're meant to be a perfect couple.

326
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,510
Why do you not pick me?

327
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,680
It's not that I don't pick you.

328
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,920
You're never one of my choices.

329
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,390
What about her?

330
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,640
You'll pick Ji Xing?

331
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,440
Do you think Grandpa Han and your family

332
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,680
will accept her?

333
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,110
It's my business.

334
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,680
That's not any of your concern.

335
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,480
Zeng Di, I told you.

336
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,550
We can be friends.

337
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,510
We can be business partners.

338
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,560
But a couple...

339
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,080
No way.

340
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,270
The treat is on me.

341
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Be careful.

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,920
Who's that handsome guy

343
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
in the suit in the canteen?

344
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,270
He's Mr. Han of Dongyang Medical.

345
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
And who's that lady?

346
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,310
His girlfriend, I guess.

347
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
She's gorgeous.

348
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,350
They look like a perfect couple.

349
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,190
Yeah.

350
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:26,950
Miss Ji.

351
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,390
Assistant Tang.

352
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,390
Miss Ji,

353
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,920
Mr. Han asked me to give you this breakfast.

354
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,110
Thank you.

355
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,510
Have a safe flight.

356
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,200
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

357
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,920
Let me help you.

358
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,280
Thank you.

359
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,350
Ji Xing,

360
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,110
looks like we got the wrong couple.

361
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,960
Oh, we did.

362
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,350
(Han Ting)
Just a normal breakfast.

363
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,720
Don't mind.

364
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,030
You don't need to explain.

365
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,460
(Ji Xing)

366
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,550
(Han Ting)
See you in China.

367
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,300
(Dongyang Group)

368
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,200
These are the materials

369
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,790
(Products)
I've collated about Hanhai's products.

370
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,790
Some are being developed.

371
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,200
Some are being sold.

372
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,510
Some are in the clinical test.

373
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,880
All kinds of them.

374
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,720
They can be the reference

375
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,560
for our future products.

376
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,590
We can do differentiated competition.

377
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,110
Let's go another way.

378
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,510
Do those projects

379
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,550
that Hanhai isn't working on.

380
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,000
I agree with Miss Li.

381
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,350
But I don't think

382
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,480
we should decide

383
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,510
what products we'll work on

384
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,880
under the influence of Hanhai.

385
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,680
We don't need to avoid them.

386
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,720
We can't avoid them at all.

387
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,880
This market is big enough.

388
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,880
We don't need to worry about similar products.

389
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,310
But anyway,

390
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,110
they have more funds

391
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,160
and their researchers

392
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,310
are three to four times more.

393
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,200
We can't make volume in this kind of products.

394
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,480
One uses several pieces at most

395
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,510
throughout his life.

396
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,350
They will choose the best brand

397
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,790
with the highest reputation.

398
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,440
Among Hanhai's products,

399
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,920
we can pick out

400
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,680
the weakest ones.

401
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,160
I'm thinking about one thing.

402
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,880
Have we carefully learned about our company?

403
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,550
All the time, we only think of Hanhai,

404
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,270
a competition of ours.

405
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,920
We don't have enough self-analysis.

406
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,200
Well, the head of each department

407
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
shall make a self-analysis report.

408
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,920
List our advantages and disadvantages.

409
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,680
Think about what we're best at,

410
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,810
what track we want to focus on,

411
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,270
and how our company

412
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,550
can have its own features.

413
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,400
Email it to me before tomorrow night.

414
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
- OK.
- Sure.

415
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
OK.

416
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,310
So much for this.

417
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,350
All right.

418
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,750
We need to hire some purchasing officers.

419
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
I've picked these.

420
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,680
Take a look.

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,510
If you approve, I'll take them over to you.

422
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,750
When you think they're OK,

423
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,920
there won't be any problem.

424
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,070
And you pick your own subordinates.

425
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,750
When I was away,

426
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,920
you had really hard work.

427
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,000
Don't say that.

428
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,430
Oh.

429
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,030
Tonight, we'll have a girls' dinner

430
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,750
to welcome you back.

431
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,400
What would you like to eat?

432
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,920
Anything. It's up to you.

433
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,920
I'll order some dishes, then.

434
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,870
OK.

435
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,240
There you are.

436
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,240
Do we need to modify it?

437
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,350
I agree.

438
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,390
What?

439
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,510
Any better with your stomach?

440
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,070
Much better.

441
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,270
Are you available tonight?

442
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,790
What would you like to eat?

443
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,200
Your stomach just recovered.

444
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,550
Let's have something good for it.

445
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,760
Casserole porridge?

446
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,880
Ji Xing is back in China.

447
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,750
We'll have a welcoming dinner for her.

448
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,750
You go with me,

449
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,190
will you?

450
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,590
Hello?

451
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,880
Are you still there?

452
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,720
Yes.

453
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,720
You don't want to go?

454
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,830
How come?

455
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,270
But it's the girls' dinner.

456
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,400
I don't think I should go.

457
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,480
I'm not familiar with them.

458
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,750
At the welcoming dinner,

459
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,750
Ji Xing is the star.

460
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,400
Have a good time tonight.

461
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,550
I'll go see you tomorrow.

462
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
But I want to see you tonight.

463
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,110
My best friends want to see you, too.

464
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,200
I want you to be there.

465
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,830
The choice is yours.

466
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,310
I'll hang up.

467
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,420
(Zhen Chinese Restaurant, Xinggang)

468
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
(Chunzhu)
Here we are.

469
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,070
Why are you always late?

470
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,480
So much work to do?

471
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,070
We're only five minutes late.

472
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,070
Are you serious?

473
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,750
Yeah. Be more considerate

474
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,880
to entrepreneurs like us.

475
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,520
What about Qiuzi?

476
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,720
She said she had things to do

477
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,160
and would not come tonight.

478
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,640
Li, didn't you say you had a surprise for us?

479
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,640
Let's order first.

480
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
Waiter,

481
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,560
come take our order.

482
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Cheers.

483
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,310
Xing, welcome back to China.

484
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,440
Thanks.

485
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,720
Li Li,

486
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,030
for social intercourse,

487
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,310
you always drink too much.

488
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,830
Drink less when you dine with us.

489
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,680
Drinking makes me happy.

490
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,440
Let her be.

491
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,640
Don't you have a stomach ache?

492
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,920
Why are you still drinking?

493
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,280
Mr. Xiao?

494
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,480
You know each other?

495
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,920
He's the owner of Xingyue Club.

496
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,880
We met several times.

497
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,350
Miss Ji, welcome back to China.

498
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,870
Li Li.

499
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
Is this seat for me?

500
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
So,

501
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,440
he is the surprise?

502
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,310
Let me introduce him.

503
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,200
This is my boyfriend,

504
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
Xiao Yixiao.

505
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,630
Thanks.

506
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,270
Thanks for the treat.

507
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,950
Where are they?

508
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,350
They have gone home.

509
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,350
Let me drive you back.

510
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,830
Shall we go to your place?

511
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
You're drunk.

512
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,350
Actually, I'm so glad

513
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,440
you're here.

514
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,240
But even Xing knows

515
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,720
you're the owner of Xingyue Club.

516
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,070
As your girlfriend,

517
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,310
I only know

518
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,440
you do investment.

519
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,830
I know nothing else about you.

520
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,880
Come on, my boyfriend.

521
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
I didn't even know

522
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
you knew Ji Xing.

523
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,440
I only met her several times.

524
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,830
And I'm not used to reporting anything.

525
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,510
I think we agree on that,

526
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,630
don't we?

527
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,110
You don't let me leave

528
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,830
or get closer.

529
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Xiao Yixiao,

530
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,640
you're totally unreasonable.

531
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
I was being insensitive.

532
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,550
My apologies.

533
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,430
OK.

534
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm going home soon.

535
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,950
Li Li.

536
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,070
I'll walk you to the door

537
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,080
instead of getting in.

538
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,560
Why?

539
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,920
Some emergency.

540
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,240
It's OK. Do what you have to do.

541
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,320
Not at all.

543
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,480
I'll go open the door.

544
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,310
You sit and continue.

545
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,070
Be right there.

546
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
Why are you back so early?

547
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,240
Aren't you supposed to be dating?

548
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
For some emergency,

549
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,440
he has gone back home.

550
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,960
What emergency?

551
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,350
How could he leave in advance

552
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,550
when dating Queen Li Li?

553
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,350
I don't know.

554
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,110
Maybe a real emergency.

555
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,720
Come on. Don't be upset.

556
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,160
Let's try a little analysis.

557
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Hey, Xing.

558
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,070
You knew Mr. Xiao, right?

559
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,070
Tell us about him.

560
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,350
I only met him several times.

561
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,240
All I know

562
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,440
is that he owns Xingyue Club

563
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,590
and he's a gentleman.

564
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,920
Oh, I see.

565
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,030
You tell us what you know about him.

566
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,670
Me?

567
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
What?

568
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,110
Don't want to gossip about him?

569
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,070
I don't know much about him.

570
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,880
If I have to say,

571
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,760
he's gentle,

572
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,310
handsome,

573
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,510
and thoughtful.

574
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,240
I can't say

575
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,830
anything further.

576
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
I want to know all about him.

577
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,070
But he shows me only half.

578
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,740
(Xinggang Hospital)

579
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,590
Nurse,

580
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,920
(Subject Recruitment)
why am I unqualified?

581
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,590
- Madam.
- I heard

582
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,000
some more serious patients

583
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,550
are even on the list.

584
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,110
Nurse, please help me.

585
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,550
Add me to the list, please.

586
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,750
Without the treatment, I would die.

587
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,270
- Sorry, madam.
- Please help me.

588
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,960
How many times have I told you?

589
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,830
I can't solve your problem.

590
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,880
Miss Ji.

591
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,110
This is the surgery video

592
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,070
you asked for yesterday.

593
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,550
OK. Thanks.

594
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,830
Help me figure out what to do.

595
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
What's going on there?

596
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,240
This patient heard

597
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,720
about getting a free intervertebral cage

598
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,110
and she signed up for it.

599
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,270
She passed the first round.

600
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,200
- But in the second round, she was eliminated.
- Help me.

601
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,070
Fine, Miss Ji. I'll get to work.

602
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,150
OK.

603
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,910
Miss Ji.

604
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,350
That's what they call you, huh?

605
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,070
Are you in charge?

606
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,480
Can you help me?

607
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,550
Why can everybody take

608
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,510
a free surgery expect me?

609
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,880
Please help me.

610
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,880
I can tell you have a waist problem.

611
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,270
How about we sit over there?

612
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,400
Let's sit and talk.

613
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,390
Miss Ji.

614
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,590
Miss Ji, you have no idea.

615
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,040
I have...

616
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,680
I have mouths to feed and diapers to change.

617
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,720
Usually, I take care of them all alone.

618
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,400
If my waist can't be healed,

619
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,070
no one can look after them.

620
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,510
What happened to your wrist?

621
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,880
I have a daughter.

622
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,790
She's naughty.

623
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,880
When I ran after her, I hit my wrist.

624
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,480
You look young, Miss Ji.

625
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,680
You don't have a child, do you?

626
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,270
You have no idea.

627
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,880
The child is all a mother cares about.

628
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
If my waist can't be healed,

629
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,510
how can my daughter live?

630
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,000
She's so little.

631
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,920
Please help me.

632
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,150
Yichen.

633
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,920
Ji Xing, take your seat.

634
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,840
I'm checking

635
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,440
the operative reports

636
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,350
of previous clinical tests.

637
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,070
The operations were successful.

638
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,680
The recovery was good, too.

639
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,510
Thanks for your hard work.

640
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,590
Do they have

641
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,510
any feedback on our product?

642
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,670
The real situation is better than expected.

643
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,150
Our experimental team

644
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,110
thinks very highly

645
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:13,950
of your product.

646
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,400
In terms of rigidity, tenacity,

647
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,710
as well as fusion,

648
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,110
it is perfect.

649
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Glad to hear that.

650
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,320
Oh, please check the materials for me.

651
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,710
Is she qualified

652
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,920
for our clinical test?

653
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,420
(Checkup Report)

654
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,700
(Health Diagnosis)

655
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,710
Judging from this alone,

656
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,840
she is qualified.

657
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,880
OK. I get it.

658
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,880
I'm going to check on the patients.

659
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,360
I had that all arranged.

660
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,430
Guo.

661
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,800
Take Miss Ji there.

662
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,400
- OK.
- Thanks.

663
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,760
This way, please.

664
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,070
Yichen.

665
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,640
Qiuzi.

666
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
What food have you brought?

667
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,760
Quite a lot.

668
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
Open it and check.

669
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,590
I just saw Xing walk out.

670
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,280
She's here for some business.

671
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,000
I would have invited her to eat with us.

672
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,390
Oh.

673
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,640
Yichen,

674
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,840
Xing doesn't know

675
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,280
we're together, does she?

676
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,630
I haven't got a chance to tell her.

677
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,590
I also want

678
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,630
to get everybody's blessing early.

679
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
I used to fear Xing would be upset

680
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
if she knew about it.

681
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,280
But the other day, Li Li told me

682
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,070
someone was also pursuing Xing.

683
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,630
I can't wait to see

684
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,000
we all live a happy life.

685
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,320
It's going to happen.

686
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,470
Let's eat.

687
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,640
OK.

688
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,280
I made your favorite sweet-and-sour ribs.

689
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
Get them out.

690
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,670
This is broccoli.

691
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,000
You love broccoli.

692
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,550
You're on a diet, right?

693
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,390
Yes.

(Positioning of Xingchen Technology)

695
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,320
Small and medium-sized enterprises shouldn't

696
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,070
wish to conquer the world in the first place.

697
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,030
They should learn to open up
new routes by taking advantage

698
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,590
of wind directions and currents.

699
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,190
Start from small businesses

700
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,360
and focus on specialization.

701
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,710
That's the first step.

702
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,160
I wonder

703
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,110
if this is a good answer

704
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,150
to your question.

705
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,150
Start from small businesses

706
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,670
and focus on specialization.

(Positioning of Xingchen Technology)

708
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,480
Hey, Zhizhou.

709
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,880
Hey, Xing.

710
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,670
Just now, among the volunteers,

711
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,670
I saw a woman named Zhang Fengmei.

712
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,190
They said you picked her.

713
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,440
Yes, I added her name to the list.

714
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,920
But, Xing,

715
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,110
don't we prefer volunteers

716
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,440
with better family finances

717
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,070
and postoperative recuperation conditions?

718
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,760
In this way, we'll get better data.

719
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,630
I showed her medical records

720
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,760
to Dr. Shao.

721
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,920
According to him,

722
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,110
her physical conditions

723
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,550
are qualified for our test.

724
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,920
Life is hard for her, I think.

725
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,110
Let's help as much as we can.

726
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,920
OK. I get it.

727
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,000
If you don't mind, I'll hang up.

728
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
OK.

729
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
Think of our positioning.

730
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,230
I will, Xing.

731
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,110
- I'll hang up.
- Bye-bye.

732
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,840
- Here.
- Thanks.

733
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,510
Give me a glass of red wine of 1982.

734
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,640
OK.

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,670
Ms. Han?

736
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,400
I dress up so differently,

737
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,550
but you still recognize me.

738
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,960
My son, indeed.

739
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,030
Why are you so beautifully dressed?

740
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,400
To visit such a cool place

741
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,280
for young guys,

742
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,110
I have to dress up.

743
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,840
Son, how's my new hairstyle?

744
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
Nice.

745
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,320
Sir,

746
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,630
the wine list, please.

747
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,160
In a minute.

748
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,240
What would you like?

749
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,840
Let me see.

750
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,630
Look at the name. "No drinking

751
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,440
Before Driving". What is that?

752
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,280
I'll take this.

753
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,280
"Love But Meet No One" or what?

754
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,070
"Sour Blue, Love But Meet No One".

755
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,070
Just a minute.

756
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,360
So many guests here.

757
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,150
Good. Rather a good business.

758
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,840
This one is perfect for you.

759
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,680
Oh, it's done.

760
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
Taste it.

761
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
Oh, son.

762
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,510
It tastes really great.

763
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,350
It does, of course.

764
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,510
What are these tools?

765
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,920
Why did you not use them?

766
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,510
It's for flair bartending.

767
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,550
Not needed for your drink.

768
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,800
Xiaomeng told me

769
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,030
you worked really hard

770
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,230
on this bar,

771
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,110
but I didn't believe it.

772
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,320
Now,

773
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,630
I believe it.

774
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,760
So, Xiaomeng knows me better.

775
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,920
Don't complain about me anymore.

776
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,030
Guys, here comes the game part.

777
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,360
Son, that wine looks good.

778
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,960
- Right.
- If you want to sing, put up your hand.

779
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,800
- That one.
- Our spotlight will get you.

780
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,800
The spotlight has found it,

781
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,010
- but you haven't.
- The first one.

782
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,230
- She can't wait
- That wine.

783
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,840
- to sing us a song!
- That one.

784
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,910
Mom,

785
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,760
the spotlight isn't on the wine, but on you.

786
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,030
Me?

787
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,440
Yes. The pretty lady in front of Mr. Lu.

788
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,440
Come forward, please.

789
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,560
Hey, this is my mother.

790
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,630
- Me?
- Give her a big hand.

791
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Pretty lady?

792
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,710
Come on!

793
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,280
- They make me shy.
- Hey, Mom.

794
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,150
- Don't...
- Here I am.

795
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,600
Every...

796
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,150
- Everybody.
- Let me lower it.

797
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,600
Oh, that's it.

798
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,550
Thank you.

799
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,510
Hello, everybody.

800
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Let me introduce myself.

801
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm the mother of the bar owner...

802
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,030
That cool guy.

803
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm his mother!

804
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,590
My name is Han Yumei.

805
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,110
Welcome to visit

806
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,670
my son's bar.

807
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,070
Hope you can

808
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
enjoy yourselves here!

809
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,760
Thanks for coming.

810
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,480
- Yeah!
- Nice!

811
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,280
Next, I'm going to sing a song.

812
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,150
I've just learned it.

813
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,110
It's very romantic.

814
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,920
Lower the key, please.

815
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,840
Thanks.

816
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,510
