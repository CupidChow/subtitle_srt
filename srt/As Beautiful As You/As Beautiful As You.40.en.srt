28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Guanghua is trying hard to build

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,350
an independent database.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,150
Why do you focus?

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,070
I think Chang He and Zeng Di

32
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,230
are obsessed with competing

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,710
with Dongyang Medical.

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,870
They've been playing too many dirty tricks.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,920
Then, I wonder how soon

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,430
we can embrace the day you've expected

37
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,630

38
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,800
will prosper together.

39
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,240
So, in a couple of days,

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Dongyang Medical will release big news.

41
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,710
Let's go.

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
You've recovered?

44
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,710
Yes. I'm fine.

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,430
What is it?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Tell me.

(R&amp;D Report of Doctorcloud)

48

Do you know

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,840
what it means to Dongyang?

51
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,080
To strangers,

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,870
it means our advantages over the past decade

53
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,710
will be totally gone.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,310
But I believe by doing this,

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,360
in the next decade or more,

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Dongyang will

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
surpass the early starters

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
OK.

Don't worry, Grandpa.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll always discuss it with her.

Han Ting has never treated

All this time,

150
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,630
I underestimated his generosity

151
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,560
and thinking.

152
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
So, you give in?

159
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,190
Tongke and Guanghua

160
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,630
will still benefit from that.

161
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm still unreconciled.

162
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
I know.

163
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,550
You agree to work with me

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,240
and insist on defeating Han Ting

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
just because you can't get over him,

even if you deny it.

167
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,960
In either business competition

168
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,910
or love competition,

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,910
one should pay his bet.

170

You and I aren't sore losers.

171
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,910
Your life is still long.

I want you to get over Han Ting,

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
look more at the outside world,

174
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,000
and value the one beside you.

175

Mr. Han, I believe Dongyang Medical

176
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,120
will be the leading company

177

186
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,030
By the way, I'll invite you

187
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,600
to Zhizhou's farewell dinner.

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,790
Our talent pool

196
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,320
has been hot news.

197
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,150
Now, many companies

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,960
come for cooperation.

199
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,550
More than that.

200
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,910
The other day, the media
did a survey in colleges.

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,750
Dongyang Medical is one of the top companies

202
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,670
college graduates want to apply for.

203
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,320
I think Dongyang Medical and Hanhai Xingchen

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,840
will embrace their best time.

205
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,630
So will we.

206
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
- Mr. Xiao.
- Miss Ji.

207
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,670
- Li Li.
- Hi.

208
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm going out for business.

209
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,150
Make yourselves comfortable.

210
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,750
What?

211
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,840
I've got over him.

212
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,270
Zhizhou is going to Germany tomorrow.

213
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,030
What's your point?

214
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,110
It's been such a long time

215
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,670
and I've witnessed

216
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,870
how Zhizhou loves you.

217
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,390
What do you think?

218
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,270
I don't want to hold him up.

219
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,440
A good relationship

220
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,510
makes the two guys improve.

221
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
No one holds up the other.

222
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,630
Fine. I understand.

223
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,720
Don't worry about me.

224
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,270
I'll think about it.

225
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,350
OK.

226
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
Let's go.

227
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,080
Enjoy yourselves. Don't stand on ceremony.

228
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,720
My nephew will pay, anyway.

229
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,120
Don't save his money.

230
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,390
Oh, Ji Xing and Li Li,

231
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,270
you're late.

232
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,360
Give us a show.

233
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,670
My niece-in-law, you first.

234
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,790
You do it.

235
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
How about you, Li Li?

236
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,150
Li Li doesn't feel well.

237
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,510
No one can give her a hard time.

238
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,600
See?

239
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,030
Xiaomeng is more thoughtful

240
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,910
than all the men here.

241
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,550
I'm not thoughtful?

242
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,790
I've been serving you all the time.

243
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm thoughtful enough.

244
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,390
Why are you jealous of everything?

245
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,590
Waste no time.

246
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
Marry her soon.

247
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
Tomorrow,

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,670
I'm going to visit Xing's parents.

249
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,360
To do the last thing

250
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,390
on the wish list.

251
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,750
What did you say? I heard you.

252
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,800
What wish list?

253
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,200
Wish list.

254
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,960
Quite romantic. Isn't it, Xing?

255
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,480
Don't make fun of me.

256
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
You don't understand.

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,150
I do, of course. The wish list.

258
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,600
Some romantic things

259
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,670
a couple will do together.

260
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,110
Come on, Xiaomeng.

261
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,240
What wish do you have?

262
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,120
I'll realize it for you.

263
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,510
I will be

264
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,120
your Wish Man.

265
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,360
My wish...

266
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,240
I wish

267
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,480
I could be a super Internet celebrity

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,390
with millions of fans.

269
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,720
Su, what is your wish?

270
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,120
I...

271
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,030
You just focus on realizing

272
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,550
Xiaomeng's wish, Wish Man.

273
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,710
That's right.

274
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
Why do you ignore my wish?

275
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,110
Come on.

276
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,670
Why do you need those fans?

277
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,550
I'm enough for you.

278
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,120
I love you and that's enough.

279
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
What are you talking about?

280
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,150
The love of the fans is different from yours.

281
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,320
The fans love me

282
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,510
- and you love me, too.
- Boss,

283
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,750
Chang He and Zeng Di

284
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,030
were taken away for investigation

285
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,630
for Zhang Fengmei's case
and slandering Hanhai Xingchen's product

286
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,000
for excessive radioactivity.

287
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,790
One has to pay the price

288
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,670
for his mistake.

289
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,040
That's right.

290
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,440
Xing,

291
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,750
what happened?

292
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,600
Chang He and Zeng Di

293
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,080
were taken away for investigation.

294
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,750
For Zhang Fengmei's case

295
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,510
and slandering our product.

296
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,870
Evil leads to evil.

297
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,550
The stigma of our company

298
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,200
has been completely cleared.

299
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,030
Xiaomeng's interview

300
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,390
with the volunteers

301
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,440
helped us a lot, too.

302
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,360
It's kind of a perfect ending

303
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,870
to our PR solution.

304
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
That's good.

305
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,270
Anyway, those trolls in my live-streaming room

306
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,390
don't dare to pop up now.

307
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,270
OK. Let's not talk about this.

308
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,480
Zhizhou, when is your flight tomorrow?

309
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,150
At eleven.

310
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
There's a time difference in Germany.

311
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,670
You may not get used to that at first.

312
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,440
Anyway, if you need any help,

313
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,480
let me know. Han Ting and I can help you.

314
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,340
Indeed.

315
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,160
I contacted the person in charge.

316
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,270
He'll look after you.

317
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Thank you, Mr. Han. Thank you, Xing.

318
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,510
I'll accept it, then.

319
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,350
Sure.

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,750
When Su is back from Germany,

321
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,000
he'll have a promotion and a pay rise

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,150
and reach the height of his success.

323
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,750
Buddy,

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,720
when you're rich, don't forget me.

325
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,270
Rest assured. I won't forget you.

326
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,000
Keep that in mind.

327
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,870
- Come on.
- Su Zhizhou.

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,270
Wish you a bright future.

329
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,320
Thanks.

330
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,550
Thanks for this farewell dinner.

331
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,600
A toast to you, everybody.

332
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,480
Come on.

333
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,440
- Come on.
- Come on.

334
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,510
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

335
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,350
I'll drink it up.

336
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,080
(But you don't want to lose him, do you?)

337
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,150
He loves you.

338
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,000
As long as you ask,

339
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,030
he will stay for you.

340
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,200
What if the passing of time

341
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,150
will not wear down Mr. Su's love?

342
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,550
Instead, it may make him

343
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,080
see his heart more clearly.

344
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,000
(So, will you)

345
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,390
(give him a second chance?)

346
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,790
(He's different from those guys)

347
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,880
(you used to meet.)

348
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,790
Don't drink so much. It may hurt your stomach.

349
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,720
You drink a lot every day.

350
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,310
Why do you think you can stop me?

351
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Excuse me.

352
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,790
A bottle of soda, please.

353
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
- Thanks.
- OK.

354
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,750
As a friend, I'm asking you

355
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,070
not to drink too much.

356
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,070
Especially such spirit.

357
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

358
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,070
Have some soda to sober up.

359
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,510
Thanks for caring.

360
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm just here to drink.

361
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,790
When you're drunk,

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,400
you can only forget the unhappy thing

363
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,680
for the moment.

364
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
When you wake up,

365
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,350
you'll still be upset about that.

366
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,950
If you don't mind,

367
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,640
tell me about it.

368
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,160
When someone listens, you'll feel better.

369
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,760
Package.

370
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,750
Hi. This is your package.

371
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,030
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

372
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,180
(Eat regularly, by Su Zhizhou.)

373
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,720
(Li Li, why do you only have)

374
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
(a sandwich for New Year's Eve?)

375
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,880
(In my hometown, we must eat jiaozi.)

376
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,200
(It represents gold ingot)

377
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,310
(that makes you wealthy.)

378
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,030
(Miss Li can't drink, indeed.)

379
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,400
But to show our sincerity,

380
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,150
I will

381
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,320
propose a toast

382
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
on her behalf.

383
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,630
What are you up to?

384
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,880
I meant to bring you some New Year's food.

385
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
Then I heard your mother
force you to have a blind date

386
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,310
and you didn't want it.

387
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,030
So, I was trying to help you out.

388
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,480
Don't worry. We're just a fake couple.

389
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,280
(Maybe in the past,)

390
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,070
you rejected me

391
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
because I was childish

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,840
and impulsive.

393
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,200
But for you, I will

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,680
get better.

395
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,920
Will you give me a second chance?

396
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,350
Li Li.

397
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,350
I adore you.

398
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,790
(Li Li, since we broke up,)

399
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
(I've been thinking.)

400
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,830
If you and I had met

401
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,030
in a different time or order,

402
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,400
I would love you regardless of anything.

403
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,640
Sadly,

404
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,270
when we met,

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,310
I had lost

406
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,400
the courage and ability to love.

407
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,830
Too many concerns.

408
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,030
Too many things I can't let go of.

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,310
So, I lost you.

410
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
I hate to admit it.

411
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,920
But...

412
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,200
Su Zhizhou indeed loves you

413
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,920
more than I do.

414
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
Li Li,

415
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,200
don't easily give up

416
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,110
on the one you love.

417
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,400
The two of you stand a chance.

418
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,680
If you really like Su Zhizhou,

419
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
don't have any regrets.

420
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,950
Please take it.

421
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

422
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,200
Su Zhizhou!

423
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,500
(Xing, Lemon, and Li)

424
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,790
(Li Li)
What's going on?

425
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,480
(Xiaomeng)
The hound finally got his girl?

426
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,790
(Ji Xing)
Looks like I'll prepare money for your wedding.

427
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,960
(Li Li)
We don't know

428
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,030
who'll have the wedding first.

429
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,870
What are you reading?

430
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,860
(We don't know who'll have the wedding first.)

431
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,240
That's good.

432
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,270
We'll be the first, of course.

433
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,070
What? Which one shall I pick?

434
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,400
You can't even decide, huh?

435
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,440
I'll see your parents.

436
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,920
I have to be serious.

437
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,200
Do you fear they'll give you a hard time?

438
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,200
Even if they do,

439
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,830
I still have to win their trust.

440
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,870
After all,

441
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,070
I'll marry their daughter.

442
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,030
OK. Whether we can get married

443
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,200
counts on you, Mr. Han.

444
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,270
I'll convince them with my sincerity.

445
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,240
Before that,

446
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,640
tell me which one I should choose.

447
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
Or we'll miss the plane.

448
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,030
I'll pick for you.

449
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
I'll get you another one.

450
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
What are the star signs of your parents?

451
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,790
Pisces and Leo.

452
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,510
What are their favorite dishes?

453
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,480
They... What? You'll cook for them.

454
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,560
Of course.

455
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,440
What's wrong? You're so nervous.

456
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm not.

457
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,080
I'm not nervous.

458
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,480
OK. Whatever you say.

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,620
(Chuancheng)

460
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,940
(Crust pastry, Beef)

461
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,510
Tastes good.

462
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,510
Don't be so impatient.

463
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,880
When I fry, you keep eating.

464
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,070
There'll be less food.

465
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,550
What? Can't I have even one?

466
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,390
You can.

467
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,480
By the way,

468
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,070
did you call Xing and Han?

469
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,070
When will they arrive?

470
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,550
I just called them.

471
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,520
They're arriving.

472
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,350
Do you think their problem

473
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,190
has been solved?

474
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,030
I'm so scared.

475
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,480
If it happens again,

476
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,510
Xing won't be able to bear it.

477
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,720
Our daughter

478
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,880
isn't muddle-headed.

479
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,640
Since she agreed

480
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,270
to get back with Han Ting,

481
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,830
she must have made up her mind.

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,840
Later,

483
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,440
let's talk to her.

484
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,840
OK.

485
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,110
There they are. Go.

486
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,150
- You're back.
- I'm back.

487
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,920
- Mrs. Ji.
- There you are, Han. Come in.

488
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,480
- OK.
- Dad, Han Ting is here.

489
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,920
- Mr. Ji.
- Hi, Han.

490
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,830
Sit for a while. Lunch will be ready.

491
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,750
OK. Shall I change the slippers?

492
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,160
No, no. Not now.

493
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,000
- Just get in.
- Come on.

494
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,440
- Get in.
- Let's get in.

495
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
Here. Have some tea.

496
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Thanks, Mrs. Ji.

497
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,920
- Take your seat.
- Mrs. Ji.

498
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,590
Some presents for you.

499
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,440
It's so sweet of you.

500
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,110
- Glad you're here.
- It's OK.

501
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,350
Lunch is ready. Come have it.

502
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Come on. Wash your hands in the bathroom.

503
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,640
The black towel in it

504
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,720
is for you, Han.

505
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
Thanks, Mrs. Ji.

506
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,910
Not at all.

507
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,310
Last Chinese New Year,

508
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,440
I prepared that for you.

509
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,790
Let's go wash our hands.

510
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,110
Come on.

511
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,240
Han,

512
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,750
it's your first time here.

513
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,030
We don't know your taste.

514
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,640
Today, Xing's father made his best dishes.

515
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,070
They're Xing's favorite dishes, too.

516
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,160
Here. Taste the stir-fried spicy chicken.

517
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,510
OK. Thanks, Mrs. Ji.

518
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,640
Here. One more piece.

519
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,520
Thank you.

520
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,590
Han,

521
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,030
you know what?

522
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,160
I made the shredded potatoes

523
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,110
in my special way.

524
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,830
Hot and spicy.

525
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,070
Way too delicious.

526
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,480
When Xing was little,

527
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,750
this dish alone

528
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,640
could make her eat a lot of rice.

529
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
Here. Taste some.

530
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,630
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

531
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,590
That's enough.

532
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,670
How does it taste?

533
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
Enough.

534
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,510
Stop when you can't eat spicy food.

535
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,880
Han,

536
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,350
we talked with you

537
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,680
about the principle thing.

538
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,920
Today, we won't bring it up.

539
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,070
But look.

540
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
For three meals a day,

541
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,350
you don't even share Xing's flavor.

542
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,510
Life is long.

543
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
How can the two of you

544
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,830
live together?

545
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
What happened was all my fault.

546
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,160
Mr. and Mrs. Ji,

547
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,680
Xing told me

548
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,270
she would stand by my side

549
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,110
and back me up.

550
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,160
I'll also be completely open to her.

551
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,310
I won't keep anything from her again.

552
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,590
Nor will I make her sad again.

553
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,350
Seriously, I want to go on with Xing.

554
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,440
For a lifetime.

555
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,000
Mr. and Mrs. Ji, hope you can

556
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,510
leave her to me without worry.

557
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,270
Her mother and I

558
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,270
don't object to your relationship.

559
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,400
You don't need

560
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,510
to promise us anything.

561
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,110
Young guys...

562
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
When you're in love,

563
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,110
you ignore everything else.

564
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,350
We totally understand.

565
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,400
But falling in love

566
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,830
and living a life

567
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,720
are totally different.

568
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,750
The two of you

569
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,920
have to learn to understand each other,

570
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,830
tolerate each other, and be considerate.

571
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,310
Most importantly, concede to each other.

572
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,270
Otherwise, even if you get married,

573
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,920
it won't last long.

574
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,070
Do you get it?

575
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,320
Yes.

576
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,510
Actually, I broke up with him

577
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,920
in a fit of anger.

578
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,510
But now, I've grown.

579
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,640
Whatever happens again,

580
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,310
we'll communicate more

581
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,480
and understand each other more.

582
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,440
We'll be fine.

583
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,590
Communication is important.

584
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,680
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Let me see.

585
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,110
All these dishes

586
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,070
are made for you.

587
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,550
They're not spicy.

588
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,920
Xing ordered the food for you.

589
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,510
I knew it. I ordered some dishes.

590
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,000
Thank you, Mrs. Ji.

591
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,950
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

592
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680
- Come on.
- Don't say that. Just eat.

593
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,160
Prawn. Have some more.

594
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,640
- Here. One more.
- OK.

595
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,320
Enjoy the dishes.

596
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,270
Here. Meatball.

597
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
- Look.
- Here. Another prawn.

598
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,440
- Have more prawns.
- OK.

599
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,720
And the chicken.

600
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,480
- Here.
- Here.

601
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,240
- Thank you.
- These are non-spicy dishes.

602
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,880
Have a drumstick.

603
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,510
Xing, you have one, too.

604
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,350
OK.

605
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,240
Taste the pancake.

606
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,350
It's super delicious.

607
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,240
- Tastes great. What's the filling?
- Beef.

608
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,550
I've loved it since I was little.

609
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Mom.

610
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,790
Oh, you're done?

611
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,720
It's done.

612
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,310
Why didn't you ask me for help?

613
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,190
It's OK.

614
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,670
Come on.

615
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,830
I want to tell you something.

616
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,270
My point is...

617
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,240
You don't need to get married so hurriedly.

618
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,880
You don't trust him?

619
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,960
Not really.

620
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
I think Han...

621
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,640
He's a very nice guy.

622
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,510
But he's from a very rich family.

623
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,510
The human relationships must be complicated.

624
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,440
When you marry him, I wonder

625
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,750
if you'll be bullied.

626
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,790
Don't worry. I met his family.

627
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,830
They're nice guys.

628
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,030
They're very nice to me.

629
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,830
And now, I have

630
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,550
a lot of shares and funds.

631
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,750
Who can bully me?

632
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,270
I urged you to get married

633
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,030
because I wanted you to have someone

634
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,550
who could love you and look after you.

635
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,550
Now, I want to keep you

636
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,350
because I want you

637
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,510
to enjoy a few more years

638
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,880
as our daughter.

639
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,520
You know what?

640
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,790
A female plays many roles in her life.

641
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,070
Among all the roles,

642
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,680
being a daughter is the simplest.

643
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,110
Nothing will change.

644
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,310
Even if I get married, I'm still your daughter.

645
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,440
Even when I have a baby,

646
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,720
I'll still call you Mom

647
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,000
and be your burden all my life.

648
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
You can never avoid me.

649
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,310
What a girl!

650
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,200
How's your life in Germany?
Are you used to it?

651
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,640
Everything is fine.

652
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,680
Now, I am

653
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
having lunch in the canteen

654
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,910
recommended by Xing.

655
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
Look.

656
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,790
German beer.

657
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,110
The only bad thing is...

658
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,240
What is it?

659
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,480
I...

660
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,590
I miss you a lot.

661
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,440
What does that mean?

662
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,960
I miss you a lot.

663
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,270
But you've just been there.

664
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,350
Focus on your work.

665
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,960
I just made some soup.

666
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,270
With some mushroom you gave me.

667
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,160
My video chats at dinnertime

668
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,030
aren't in vain.

669
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
You're like a supervisor.

670
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,070
I'll eat regularly.

671
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Oh, by the end of this month,

672
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,510
in Dusseldorf, Germany,

673
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,420
there will be an International Expo
of Medical Equipment.

674
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,640
I'll be sent.

675
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,550
Then I'll visit you in Munich.

676
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,760
Really?

677
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,960
Dusseldorf is actually far away from here.

678
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,200
How about this?

679
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,590
I'll take a couple of days off and visit you.

680
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,150
We can go to the expo together.

681
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,710
We'll see.

682
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,640
See you in Germany.

683
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,510
See you there.

684
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,720
Cheers.

685
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,510
Cheers.

686
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,710
I'll hang up.

687
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,160
Bye-bye.

688
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,200
Bye-bye.

689
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Why do you have to leave so hurriedly

690
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,030
after only one night?

691
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,470
We're busy, you know.

692
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,280
There's a lot of work to be handled.

693
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,150
Yeah. During the Chinese New Year,

694
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,510
we'll come and visit you.

695
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,030
- Fine.
- Han,

696
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,110
open the suitcase.

697
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,760
Here's some sausage and bacon

698
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,840
I dried myself.

699
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,800
Take it back.

700
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,840
- Thanks, Mr. Ji.
- Give us no more.

701
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,360
It's too much for the suitcase.

702
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,480
No more.

703
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
Even if you want it.

704
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,550
If you want more later,

705
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,480
I'll send you some.

706
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,670
Fine. Do one more important thing.

707
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,320
After that, you can leave.

708
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,150
Come on. Take a family photo.

709
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,070
OK?

710
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,150
One, two, three.

711
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,420
(10. Visit Xing's parents in her hometown.)

714
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,840
Xing, I'll take you somewhere tonight.

715
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,350
OK.

716
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,230
Why did you take me here?

717
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,630
Before I met you,

718
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,400
I had never thought

719
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,320
I would want to spend my life with someone,

720
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,230
care for her emotions,

721
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,030
or think about our future.

722
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,440
So...

723
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,960
I want to do something important,

Out of my way. I'm making a video of Ms. Han.

768
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,510
I'll post it online later.

769
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Don't stand in my way. Come on.

770
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,880
Gorgeous.

771
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,670
Hey, didn't we make a deal?

772
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,590
Smart Lemon and Mr. Lu

773
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,760
is an account of our romance.

774
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,280
Why is it filled with my mother's videos?

775
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,280
Speaking of this, I've got an idea.

776
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,110
I plan to change this account

777
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,150
into Smart Lemon, Ms. Gorgeous,

778
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,280
and Mr. Lu.

779
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,710
That's great.

780
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,440
You're upset?

781
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,550
All right. Come on.

782
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,880
Let's take a photo

783
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,070
for the profile of our account.

784
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,910
A bigger smile.

786
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,110
What are you reading?

787
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,710
Grandpa sent this.

788
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,350
Let me see.

789
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,280
These terms are favorable for me.

790
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,440
They not only secure my interests

791
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,070
but also make sure
I won't chip away Dongyang's foundation.

792
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,380
(Prenuptial Agreement)

793
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,510
It's not going to happen.

794
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,280
Are you sure it's me?

795
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,350
What?

796
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,880
You said,

797
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,230
love should be

798
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,280
gradually accumulated.

799
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,110
How can you be sure

800
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,670
you'll gradually fall in love with me?

801
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,360
I've loved you for a long time.

802
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,150
Then will you bully me?

803
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,150
How?

804
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,280
Beat me, curse me, or annoy me.

805
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
You're so glib-tongued.

806
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,630
Guess who'll be killed by anger first.

807
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,320
Then...

808
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Will you cheat on me?

809
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,630
You alone give me a headache already.

810
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,880
How do I give you a headache?

811
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,440
You alone give me a headache already.

812
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,320
After we get married, do you

813
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,280
have any expectations and requirements for me?

814
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,510
No. What about you?

815
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,320
No.

816
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
What do you expect?

817
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,110
Just love me.

818
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,470
I will.

820
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,840
You're popular, Mr. Han.

821
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,000
So many likes and comments

822
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,880

823
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,480
Do you remember this place?

824
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,510
How about this?

825
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,150
Check how much the damage will cost.

826
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,320
I'll share it with him.

827
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,280
Tang Song,

828
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,630
get their numbers and let them go.

829
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,440
Boss, you're not that kind-hearted.

830
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,880
You extorted me at last.

831
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,440
I didn't ask for anything.

832
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,230
You did.

834
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,630

836
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,390

840
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:02,910
You made them?

841
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,440
The wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

842
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,920
I have to prepare enough.

843
