00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
(He didn't say he would show up.)

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,340
(What if he doesn't come?)

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,300
(And the day after tomorrow.)

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,420
(- Possibly.
- And...)

27
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,560
For the follow-up work,

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,430
I'll have Tang Song contact you.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,730
You call Liu Lushan

30
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,190
from Wanli Logistics

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,430
and invite him to dinner tomorrow.

32
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,000
OK, boss.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Miss Ji asked to meet you at half past eight

34
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,280
in Star Ice on Longshan Road.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,030
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

36
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,840
You said today's meeting was important

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,150
and asked me not to disturb you.

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
Boss, Miss Ji's calling.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Put her on the speaker.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,400
Assistant Tang, Mr. Han...

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,710
I was held up.

42
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,560
I'll arrive in ten minutes.

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,030
OK.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
I'll wait for you.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
Drive faster.

46
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,550
OK.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,840
Waitress.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,920
Hello.

49
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,910
My ice cream can be served now.

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
OK. A minute, please.

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
The subscriber you dialed

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
is busy.

53
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Please redial later.

54
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,420
(Turning off...)

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Waitress.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Yes.

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,710
Do you have a power bank?

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes. Just a minute.

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,470
- Thanks.
- OK.

60
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,800
(Xing)
Here I am. Did you leave?

61
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,040
Sorry,

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,190
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

63
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,030
Waiter.

64
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,870
Is there any other branch nearby?

65
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,160
No, sir.

66
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,390
Are you looking for someone?

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,680
There's a Star Ice on front Longshan Road.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
I-C-E, Ice.

69
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,050
People often mistake the two stores.

70
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,110
How can I get there?

71
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,160
I went to the wrong store.

72
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,160
This is Star Ice on front Longshan Road.

73
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,920
There's a Star Eyes

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,070
on rear Longshan Road.

75
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,360
E-Y-E-S, Eyes.

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
I was waiting for you there.

77
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,560
I often mistake the two stores, too.

78
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,120
- Waitress.
- Coming.

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
Boss.

80
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,390
Boss, where are you going?

81
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,070
Let me drive you!

82
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,110
Ji Xing!

83
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,630
If you want to see me,

84
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,600
you can text me directly.

85
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,790
OK.

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,510
Hungry from waiting, huh?

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,870
Shall we eat together?

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
OK.

89
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,360
Then let's go...

90
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,000
- OK.
- Come on.

91
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,310
Come on.

92
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,870
You've vomited in three places.

93
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you even have more to vomit?

94
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,270
No.

95
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,750
I'm fine.

96
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,070
I'll practice drinking more.

97
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,270
Next time, I'll get them all drunk.

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't think of next time.

99
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
You can't hold your liquor.

100
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,950
Don't try to be strong anymore.

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,510
I called a taxi for you.

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,750
It'll send you back home.

103
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,950
Li Li,

104
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,680
when I saw them make you drink,

105
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,160
I couldn't help defending you.

106
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,800
I promised

107
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
I would protect you.

108
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,710
Su Zhizhou,

109
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,070
thank you for defending me tonight.

110
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,360
But we're only colleagues.

111
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
You needn't have done this.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,870
I know.

113
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,710
Li Li,

114
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,870
I may not be a very good guy.

115
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,870
But I'm willing to show you
every piece of mine.

116
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Do I really

117
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,950
stand no chance?

118
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,830
I have a boyfriend.

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
We're in a stable relationship.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,950
So, stop wasting your time on me.

121
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,070
Your unilateral contribution

122
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
will stress me out.

123
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,240
You'll feel the pain, too.

124
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,160
I hope we'll be colleagues only.

125
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,070
Did you call the taxi?

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
Please wait a minute, sir.

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,440
OK.

128
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,630
Can you walk?

129
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,870
Sir, my friend is drunk.

130
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,790
Keep an eye on him, please.

131
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,750
OK. No problem.

132
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,150
Aren't you leaving?

133
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,750
I have things to do.

134
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,000
Stay safe, then.

135
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
Xiao Yixiao,

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,390
can I go to your home now?

137
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,110
I get it.

138
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,480
Tomorrow, I'll bring some ingredients

139
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,000
and cook for you at your place,

140
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,990
OK?

141
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,840
I'll hang up.

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
See you tomorrow.

143
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,790
Smart Lemon, I have a job offer.

144
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,630
Will you take it?

145
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,910
(Lu Linjia)
My bar will open.

146
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Come and advertise for it.

147
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,150
You name a price.

148
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,440
(Smart Lemon)
On the opening day,

149
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,380
I'll do a live streaming there.

150
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,720
Have fun on the opening day.

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,030
Don't bother to work.

152
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,350
After that,

153
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,840
come do the live streaming someday.

154
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,180
(Lu Linjia)

155
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,480
(Smart Lemon)
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,020
(Hi. Do you miss me?)

157
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Lu, what are you looking at so happily?

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
A pretty girl, huh?

159
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,480
In what universe is she a pretty girl?

160
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,200
Obviously, she is.

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Focus on your work.

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,920
OK.

163
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
She's pretty, indeed.

164
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,550
How have I never noticed

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
she's so pretty?

166
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,790
Qiuzi, what are you doing here?

167
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,150
Yichen.

168
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,750
I know you've been preparing

169
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,480
for the Innovation Center of Xinggang Hospital.

170
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,360
An uncle of mine

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,670
works at Xinggang Hospital.

172
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,360
I asked him for some materials.

173
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,200
Maybe they can be helpful.

174
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,030
Can I get in?

175
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,230
Come in, please.

176
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,000
The materials are in it.

177
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
I've bought you some dessert.

178
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,360
People say when someone uses his brain,

179
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,630
he should eat something sweet

180
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,150
that will stimulate dopamine

181
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,840
and improve memory.

182
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,390
It's thoughtful of you. Thanks.

183
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,080
Don't stand on ceremony.

184
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
Have you been

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,390
too busy preparing?

186
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
It's quite messy here.

187
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,720
Sorry.

188
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,630
These days,

189
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,720
I didn't have time to tidy it up.

190
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,550
Let me do this. You just sit.

191
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,870
I can't let you do that. Leave it to me.

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,870
Yichen.

He said he also sent you an invitation.

Go up and put your luggage.

217
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,360
I'll be bored to go alone.

When we were happy, we stayed together.

381
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,520
Otherwise, we broke up.

382
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,590
I was so free

383
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,070
and didn't want to know about them.

384
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,310
I just wanted them to make me happy.

385
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,510
But since I knew you,

386
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,110
I've made many exceptions.

387
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,510
I want to learn more about you.

388
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,200
I want more from you, too.

389
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
I even find myself

390
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,920
very strange.

391
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
But you're what you used to be.

392
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,070
I'm not.

393
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,750
I've been worried about losing you.

394
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm not as big-hearted as before.

395
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,950
Li Li,

396
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,070
it takes time to know about each other.

397
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,030
But I don't want to get stuck deeper.

398
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,310
Our relationship

399
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,920
will not work out, will it?

400
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,200
That's not true.

401
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,680
You're saying this

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,030
only because you don't want

403
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
to break up for the moment.

404
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
Li Li,

405
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,880
I want to be serious with you.

406
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,400
Let's be together.

407
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,270
If you're too worried

408
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,400
to love wholeheartedly,

409
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,720
I'd officially invite you.

410
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
Please be my girlfriend.

411
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,030
From this day on,

412
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
we'll be the rightful couple.

413
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,870
Li Li,

414
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
will you accept me?

415
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,350
Yes.

416
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,700
(Xinggang Hospital)

417
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,500
(Outpatient)

418
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Now,

419
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,440
I'm taking you

420
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,830
to see our attending doctor,

421
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,670
Director Wei.

422
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
Director Wei.

423
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,070
I was just coming to find you.

424
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,390
Director Wei De

425
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,960
is the attending doctor

426
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,200
for this clinical test.

427
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,400
This is Ji Xing, CEO

428
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,640
of Xingchen Technology

429
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,070
that works out

430
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,080
the intervertebral cage.

431
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,830
- Hi, Director Wei.
- Hi.

432
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,030
This is Miss Li from our sales department.

433
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,310
- Nice to meet you.
- Director, the report is ready.

434
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,550
My assistant physician will come.

435
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,590
He'll take care of the follow-up.

436
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,590
- OK?
- No problem.

437
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,510
I have a meeting.

438
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,630
I'll let you guys talk.

439
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,630
OK.

440
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,350
Ji Xing.

441
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,720
You know each other?

442
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,030
We were schoolmates at Xinggang University.

443
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,870
What a coincidence!

444
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,200
This is Shao Yichen,

445
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,590
Director Wei's assistant physician.

446
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,030
Since you know each other,

447
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,070
it'll be more convenient to communicate.

448
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
That's right.

449
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Well, you guys talk.

450
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,640
I have work to do. Excuse me.

451
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,870
Go ahead.

452
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,560
Come and sit.

453
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,110
Recently,

454
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,200
how have you been doing?

455
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,520
Good.

456
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,310
Our company is on track, too.

457
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,590
Why are you here?

458
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,590
I was just transferred from People's Hospital.

459
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,160
The Orthopedic Innovation Center

460
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,880
was just established, huh?

461
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,830
Besides,

462
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,960
Director Wei is a good pal

463
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,790
of my college adviser.

464
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,110
So, I was recommended.

465
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,270
In this hospital,

466
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,480
I also take part

467
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,030
in clinical tests of some innovative projects.

468
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,200
But I didn't know

469
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,720
Xingchen was the first company

470
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
I would cooperate with.

471
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,590
What? Will you

472
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,750
reject the job

473
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,720
because we're from Xingchen?

474
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,110
No. Why would I?

475
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,720
We'll count on you and Director Wei, then.

476
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
No problem.

477
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Do I have to

478
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,200
call you Miss Ji?

479
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,320
Whatever.

480
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,980
(Ji Xing)

481
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,240
Mr. Han, Xingchen's first clinical test

482
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,790
of its intervertebral cage

483
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,880
will start at nine tomorrow morning.

484
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,200
If you have time, will you

485
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,720
come to Xinggang Hospital and watch it?

486
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,400
(Han Ting)
It's eight at night.

487
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,640
Such an "early" invitation.

488
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,830
Sorry. I was too busy to remember that.

489
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,820
(Ji Xing)

490
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,000
(Han Ting)
It's OK.

491
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,160
The second payment

492
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
has arrived, after all.

493
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,000
You won't be scared.

494
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,830
What a man!

495
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,570
(Ji Xing)
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,830
I know you're extremely busy.

497
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,960
Next time, I'll invite you earlier.

498
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,310
It depends.

499
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,540
(Han Ting)

500
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
It depends?

501
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,000
So, will he or will he not come?

502
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,070
Whatever.

503
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
There you are, at last.

504
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,400
There's so much traffic.

505
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,590
Has everybody arrived?

506
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,240
Yes. They're outside the operating room.

507
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,640
- OK.
- Mr. Han is here, too.

508
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,830
He's in Shao Yichen's office.

509
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,670
Let's hurry.

510
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,670
Come on.

511
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,790
What about the previous patients?

512
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,200
They recovered well.

513
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
Sorry, I'm late.

514
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,510
Ji Xing, come and sit.

515
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,000
Sit here.

516
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,680
Let's go on, Dr. Shao.

517
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
OK.

518
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,920
The advantage of titanium alloy

519
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,960
lies in its high compatibility.

520
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
The trabeculae

521
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,270
contributes to bone growth.

522
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,320
Right.

523
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,790
I've checked the cage

524
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,720
Mr. Su brought us.

525
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,960
It is exactly the product

526
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
we've been expecting.

527
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,630
So much for this.

528
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,680
I'll go get prepared.

529
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,110
OK.

530
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,670
Don't worry.

531
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,720
It'll be OK.

532
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,720
The doctor team...

533
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,590
Did you designate him?

534
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,550
Only later did I learn

535
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,480
he was Prof. Wei's assistant.

536
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,790
But Shao Yichen is very professional.

537
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,590
You think so highly of him.

538
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,520
I do?

539
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,270
Are you confident?

540
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,510
I'm nervous, anyway,

541
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,200
as if I would take an examination.

542
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,200
How long did the printing take?

543
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,270
Half an hour.

544
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,830
When quality is assured,

545
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,310
make the printing of a single piece

546
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,720
as short as you can.

547
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,820
(Outpatient)

548
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,140
(Operating Room, Recovery Room)

549
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,030
Don't be afraid. It'll be OK.

550
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Don't be nervous.

551
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,310
How's it, doctor?

552
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,310
The surgery is successful.

553
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,590
Your customized intervertebral cage

554
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,680
works perfectly for the volunteer.

555
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,750
That's great.

556
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,310
We made it!

557
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,110
We made it.

558
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,030
Thank you, doctor.

559
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,150
Thank you.

560
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,030
Thank you so much.

561
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,720
If you hadn't

562
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,400
given him this chance,

563
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,510
my son

564
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,510
may not stand up

565
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,000
for the rest of his life.

566
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,950
Miss Ji,

567
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,110
your company will be successful.

568
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,790
Good people deserve good things.

569
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
As long as he recuperates properly,

570
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,590
there won't be a problem.

571
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,790
- Thanks, Director Wei.
- Thanks.

572
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,510
Thank you, Dr. Shao.
You had a hard day.

573
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,440
Shao, later,

574
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,270
confirm the follow-up with them.

575
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,680
I have work to do.

576
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,520
OK.

577
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,720
You go ahead.

578
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
OK.

579
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,830
Thank you, doctor.

580
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,110
I'll go get changed.

581
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,030
Later, we'll talk in my office.

582
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,590
I have to take this.

583
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,480
You guys talk.

584
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,590
Congratulations.

585
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,550
This clinical test

586
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
is such a success

587
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
and the quality of your product

588
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,150
has contributed to it.

589
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,280
Take your seats.

590
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,110
According to Director Wei,

591
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,510
for the following clinical tests,

592
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,510
if you're in need,

593
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,030
we can keep cooperating.

594
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,120
That's great.

595
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,000
The successful transplant
of the intervertebral cage

596
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,400
is just the first step.

597
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,360
Later, we'll follow up

598
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,320
on the patient's recovery

599
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,480
and rejection.

600
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,800
We can't let our guard down.

601
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
Am I right, Dr. Shao?

602
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Yes.

603
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,280
You're right, Mr. Han.

604
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,440
OK. If you don't mind, we should go.

605
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
Xing, shall we invite our employees

606
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,880
to have lunch for celebration?

607
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,630
Mr. Han, Yichen,

608
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,110
join us if you have time.

609
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,920
OK. Let's have lunch if you have time.

610
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,030
It's OK with me.

611
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,880
Today is a good day, anyway.

612
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,320
It's worth celebrating.

613
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,280
Sorry, everybody.

614
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,360
Mr. Han postponed

615
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,200
his schedules for today.

616
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,190
He has a lot more things to handle.

617
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,880
Sorry. Next time, I'll invite you earlier.

618
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,760
It doesn't matter.

619
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,800
I just think

620
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,710
it's too early to celebrate yet.

621
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,550
On the day of surgery, the patient

622
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,230
must be carefully observed.

623
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,840
I guess Dr. Shao

624
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,190
doesn't have time for lunch,

625
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,030
right?

626
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,710
Rest assured, everybody.

627
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,320
I'll keep focusing

628
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,110
on the follow-up of the volunteer.

629
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,070
But I do have some work to do.

630
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,550
I'm not going

631
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,710
to today's celebration lunch.

632
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,920
Sorry, guys.

633
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,440
OK. We'll dine together another day.

634
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,590
Let's celebrate after the total success.

635
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,530
OK.

636
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,800
Let's go have lunch.

637
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,790
All right.

638
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,640
Come on.

639
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,030
As for the follow-up,

640
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,030
call me if necessary.

641
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,670
OK. Don't worry.

642
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,640
Bye-bye.

643
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,460
(Xinggang Hospital)

644
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,320
Oh,

645
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
Dongyang also has

646
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
some close clinical institutions.

647
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,230
Shall I share them?

648
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,280
But the clinical test has just started.

649
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
I want to cooperate with this hospital

650
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,110
on more surgeries.

651
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,190
Let's go have lunch.

652
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,280
Get in the car.

653
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,150
Xing, you go with Mr. Han.

654
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,190
I'll wait for Li Li.

655
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
OK. I'll send you the location.

656
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,150
Where's Xing?

657
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,590
Why are you here alone?

658
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,630
They've gone to the restaurant.

659
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,510
They sent me the location.

660
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,590
Let's go together.

661
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,430
I'll get a taxi.

662
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,590
You go alone.

663
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,510
I'm not going.

664
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,070
My boyfriend is here.

665
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,350
I should go.

666
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,990
Ms. Yuan.

667
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,710
Mr. Chang,

668
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,440
you're in such a good mood.

669
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Ms. Yuan, rest assured.

670
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,920
This is

671
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,880
my private mansion.

672
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,710
No one will disturb us.

673
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,200
Be seated, please.

674
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Enjoy it.

675
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,590
What do you want me for, Mr. Chang?

676
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,480
I just heard

677
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,840
the clinical test

678
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,590
of Xingchen Technology

679
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,640
was successful.

680
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,550
Aren't you worried?

681
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,070
About what?

682
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,800
When a Dongyang-owned company

683
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,760
achieved something,

684
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,670
I would be only glad.

685
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,190
I'm worried about you, Ms. Yuan.

686
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,670
Since Han Ting returned to China,

687
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,400
he's been doing great in business.

688
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,800
He even cleared your men

689
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,440
out of the core team.

690
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,440
If you let him go on like this,

691
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,800
don't you fear

692
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,710
he'll replace you someday?

693
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,070
Mr. Chang,

694
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,320
just get to the point.

695
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,190
I want to work with you

696
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,710
to make Han Ting

697
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,400
no longer the CEO

698
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
of Dongyang Medical.

699
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,800
I'll pretend I didn't hear

700
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,550
what you just said.

701
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,320
Why?

702
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,280
Do you suddenly

703
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,440
care for your cousin

704
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,590
instead of trying to take him down?

705
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,030
You developed Dongyang Medical.

706
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,030
I don't believe

707
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,550
you'll give away the company you have

708
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,390
worked on for ten years.

709
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,230
Our companies

710
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,880
have been competitors for years.

711
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,070
Relatives are favored over outsiders.

712
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,190
I'm sure you know this.

713
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,170
Ms. Yuan, you put it so prettily.

714
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,320
I'll get to the point, then.

715
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,400
Now, you don't do anything

716
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,440
only because you think Han Ting

717
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,840
can't realize his pledge.

718
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,630
You'll just wait until he leaves.

719
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,760
But Ms. Yuan,

720
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,590
let me ask you one question.

721
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,030
Are you really so sure?

722
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,760
Han Ting is your cousin.

723
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,190
You know more about him than I do.

724
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,400
Will he just sit around doing nothing

725
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,440
until you make him desperate enough?

726
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
I bet,

727
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,840
since he dares to make

728
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,760
such a pledge,

729
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,400
he will win the gambling.

730
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,280
One more thing.

731
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,960
Someone has been buying fractional shares

732
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,840
of Dongyang Medical.

733
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,550
Who do you think

734
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,150
is behind all this?

735
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,670
You take Han Ting as your family.

736
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,190
But he isn't grateful.

737
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,550
It's our family business.

738
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,110
You don't need to bother.

739
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,070
Everybody wants to be like this creature.

740
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,840
It attracts wealth

741
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,280
without giving out any.

742
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,670
But in this world,

743
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,840
no one can get what he wants

744
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,630
without paying a price.

745
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,030
Ms. Yuan,

746
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,070
in some cases,

747
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,280
you choose between the lesser of two evils.

748
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,440
I never force anyone.

749
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,710
I can wait.

750
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,590
When you change your mind,

751
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,630
come to me for some tea at any time.

752
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,680
The tea is good.

753
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,800
Call me if you need anything.

754
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,880
OK.

755
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
- I'll let you work.
- Thanks.

I was watching you for a while.

760
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,920
With this bottle of wine,

761
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,920
you're drinking all night.

762
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,880
None of your business.

763
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,630
If I guess correctly,

764
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,880
you're lovesick, right?

765
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,120
Tell me about it.

766
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,230
Come on. Who are you?

767
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,030
Just a passer-by.

768
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,400
You and I are basically the same age.

769
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,590
Tell me about it.

770
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,150
A bottle of whisky and a fruit tray.

771
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,400
- OK.
- Thanks.

772
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,030
It's your treat.

773
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,710
No problem.

774
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,680
Tell me.

775
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,670
We don't know each other, anyway.

776
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,280
Telling you will not disgrace me.

777
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,800
I'm in love with a lady.

778
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,230
She has a beautiful name.

779
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,470
Li Li.
