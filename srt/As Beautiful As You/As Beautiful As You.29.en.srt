23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
(Xingchen always talks with its products.)

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,790
(Our original dream and goal)

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,590
(Personnel)
(are to offer medical resources)

26
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,590
(to every common guy)

27
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,350
(and enable ordinary people)

28
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,870
(to have customized medical products.)

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,950
(The starlight is faint,)

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,950
(but it can light up somewhere.)

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,660
(The starlight is faint,
but it can light up somewhere.)

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,380
(Junk company, close down.)

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,660
(An entrepreneur like me resonates.)

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,660
(Don't talk big unless you can do it, OK?)

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
What are you doing here?

36
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,750
Good.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,590
You turned it around.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,870
There are still many cursing comments.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Stop reading, then.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,910
How are you feeling? You must be tried.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
Shall I take you out for a walk?

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Where are we going?

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,360
To see the best night view in Xinggang.

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Let's go.

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,030
When I worked in Guanghua,

46
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,310
after a late night working,

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,310
I saw this night view,

48
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,280
I would find this city very strange.

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,870
I had no place here.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
I worked so hard

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
and I was excellent.

52
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,120
Why could I not get what I wanted?

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,560
Because I wasn't powerful enough then.

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,190
Later, I established Xingchen.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,960
In the middle of the night, I also sighed.

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
"Wow, I could finally

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,150
have a place

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,240
in this city."

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,710
But today...

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,910
This city looks strange again

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,080
just as how it looked

62
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,150
in the very beginning.

63
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,310
Not because I'm not powerful enough,

64
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,360
but because I've grown.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
I realize

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,870
I've got something

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,750
and I've lost something.

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
Today, I had a fight

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,310
where both parties were hurt.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,400
To be honest,

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,270
I don't care how Huang Weiwei feels.

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,750
She betrayed me.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,950
In her eyes,

74
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,240
maybe I also hurt her.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,560
It's hard to tell.

76
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,000
The only thing I feel bad about is...

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,070
I think I lost something

78
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,160
that I would never get back again.

79
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,680
Look at the road in front of you.

80
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,750
When you walk on it,

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,190
you'll meet someone and experience something

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,270
that you can't avoid.

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,040
Nobody's comfort will help.

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,920
Before you feel everything personally,

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,750
you can't pass along it.

86
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,510
You must have experienced this

87
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,720
hundreds of times.

88
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
How does it feel?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,310
After experiencing too much,

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
you have no feelings at all?

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,430
Not really.

92
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,920
It's just an attitude.

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,270
This is life.

94
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,750
We give and take.

95
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,720
At best, it's an equal exchange.

96
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,870
Actually, it's just a deal.

97
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,390
Whatever you want to get,

98
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,360
you have to pay something for it.

99
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,480
When you see it through,

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,800
you'll be used to that.

101
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,710
What?

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,920
Nothing. I just want to touch you.

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,950
Are you feeling better now?

104
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,830
I'm very happy now.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
(Because of you.)

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,520
Done.

107
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,510
Oh, wonton is ready?

108
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,110
It's a treat for you.

109
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,410
(Laosi Wonton Shop)

110
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,270
I hear

111
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,120
no tech companies

112
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,310
dare to employ Huang Weiwei.

113
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,750
Han Yuan paid her

114
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,800
and then discarded her.

115
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,040
She has totally

116
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,310
ruined herself.

117
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,070
It's her own choice.

118
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,120
She deserves it.

119
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
I didn't expect Ji Xing to be so resolute.

120
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,800
She's grown really fast.

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,120
Where's the stuff I want?

122
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
You guessed right.

123
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,310
Han Yuan and Chang He

124
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,830
colluded a long time ago.

125
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
They saw each other three times a month.

126
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,870
In order not to attract attention,

127
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,720
they met somewhere very secret.

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,720
It's also Han Yuan

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,680
who told Chang He

130
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,040
about our acquisition offer

131
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,390
for Zhu's Medical Instrument.

132
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,720
Since the last board meeting,

133
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,190
she's been investigating

134
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,950
outside partnership of Dongyang Medical.

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,800
Has she figured out

136
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,720
your relationship with Hanhai?

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,190
Then your investment in Hanhai

138
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,070
will be revealed.

139
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,840
If Ji Xing knows

140
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,750
Hanhai has developed

141
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,840
with your full support...

142
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,720
I'll find the right opportunity to tell her.

143
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,840
It's better

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,390
than she's informed by someone else.

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,200
This...

146
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,550
What is this? So sour.

147
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,750
Son,

148
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,240
are you being upset

149
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,270
because I'm in your bar?

150
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,600
No.

151
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,790
It's not about you.

152
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
Then...

153
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,710
You...

154
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Ms. Han,

155
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,910
I have a friend.

156
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,870
When he confessed his love,

157
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,870
the girl said they could be brother and sister.

158
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,910
What do you think he should do now?

159
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,120
Don't be discouraged.

160
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
In love,

161
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,030
you must not shrink.

162
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
You...

163
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,120
No, I mean...

164
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
You just tell your friend

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,510
not to back down.

166
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,910
You know what?
When I pursued my father,

167
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,080
if I gave up,

168
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,790
you wouldn't have existed.

169
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
But I fear

170
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,630
if I keep pursuing her, she'll stay farther.

171
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,270
You have to endure hardships.

172
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,270
You know what?

173
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,840
I always think

174
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Ting and Ji Xing

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,240
must have communicated

176
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,150
when they were in college.

177
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,200
Look how far Ting has gone

178
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,550
over all these hardships.

179
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,870
Son, you're still staying put.

180
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,910
You aren't even in the position to run.

181
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,670
No way. You have to be fast.

182
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
For your father,

183
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,670
I even went to Taiwan, China.

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
Right.

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,160
Come on, Ms. Han.

186
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,000
A friend of mine, not me.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,320
I understand.

188
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,840
It's not you, Mr. Lu.

189
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,200
Ms. Han, you know that?

190
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm your mother, OK?

191
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,120
During the Spring Festival,
when I used your phone

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
to give some presents

193
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,120
to Miss Xiaomeng,

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
I got to know

195
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,320
you were her bitter enemy, Mr. Lu.

196
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,910
Every day,

197
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,960
in another girl's live-streaming,

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,630
you kept giving presents

199
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,670
and helping her beat Miss Xiaomeng.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,670
Now, you want Miss Xiaomeng

201
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,790
to accept you soon.

202
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,360
Do you think it's possible?

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,390
I get it.

204
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,390
Come on,

205
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,670
Mr. Lu.

206
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,550
Ms. Han, stop calling me that.

207
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,240
Fine, fine.

208
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,870
Mr. Lu...

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Linjia.

210
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,360
Give me another drink.

211
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,670
Here. It tastes awful.

212
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,150
OK. Just a second.

213
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,630
Put less lemon.

214
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,670
(Shao Yichen&amp; Wei Qiuzi)
Next, the bride and groom

215
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,840
will make wedding vows.

216
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,750
Qiuzi,

217
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
thank you.

218
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,670
In my toughest

219
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,790
and most important times,

220
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,270
you were there by my side.

221
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
In the future,

222
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,510
I'll be there for you, too.

223
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,510
Together with you,

224
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,200
I'll keep our family well.

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
Qiuzi,

226
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,200
for the rest of my life,

227
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,470
I'll love you every day.

228
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Yichen,

229
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,030
since the day

230
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,080
we were in a relationship,

231
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,720
you've always been the one

232
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,790
I want to spend my life with.

233
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,270
A simple life

234
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,030
is what you want.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,510
And what I want

236
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
is to see you every day.

237
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,120
This is the future I want most.

238
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,550
We just heard

239
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,600
what the couple said

240
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,670
from the bottom

241
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,200
of their hearts.

242
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,470
I know.

243
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,840
The life they want

244
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,030
is very simple.

245
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,910
I'm happy for them.

246
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,030
All they want is to laugh in the living room,

247
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,600
cook in the kitchen,

248
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
and hug in the bedroom.

249
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,870
Then, let's

250
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,910
sincerely wish

251
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,270
the couple

252
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
can always love each other

253
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,000
and always be happy.

254
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,720
Bride and groom,

255
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,630
exchange your wedding rings.

256
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's give them

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,120
our applause and best wishes.

258
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,630
We witnessed the happiest and sweetest moment

259
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,390
of the couple.

260
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,360
Next,

261
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,270
we'll spread the happiness.

262
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,360
Unmarried guests,

263
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,600
please come up here

264
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,630
to fight for the bouquet of happiness

265
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,750
from the bride.

266
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,790
Come up, please.

267
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,910
Let's go.

268
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,670
Bride, please turn your back

269
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,670
to the guests.

270
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,510
Out for a walk?

271
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
OK.

272
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
Come on.

273
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,240
Next, let's

274
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,390
countdown from three.

275
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,550
Get ready. Three, two, one!

276
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,750
- Here.
- Give it to me.

277
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,870
Great.

278
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,960
Congratulations, madam.

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Congrats on getting it.

280
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,550
Congrats, Li Li. You got the bouquet.

281
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,960
I believe in the near future,

282
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,960
you will also get

283
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,510
your happy life.

284
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,240
Friends, next comes

285
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,550
the photo session.

286
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,510
Dear guests,

287
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,200
follow an order to take a photo

288
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,670
- with the couple.
- Let's go.

289
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,910
There you go.

290
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,870
I just realized today

291
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,600
that a wedding could be so romantic.

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,000
The light, the vibe,

293
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,080
the flowers,

294
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,960
and the music.

295
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,320
With all these things,

296
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,670
everybody easily gets moved.

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,510
I got the bouquet.

298
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,840
Why do I think

299
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,790
the bride threw it to you deliberately?

300
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
I fought for it anyway.

301
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,390
A bouquet won't prove valuable

302
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,490
until its meaning is fulfilled.

303
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,030
What kind of wedding do you want?

304
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,840
A church wedding?

305
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,480
Or a seaside wedding?

306
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Actually, I think

307
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,200
a wedding trip is good.

308
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,040
Li Li.

309
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,230
Li Li.

310
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm not getting married again.

311
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,440
You know all about my situation.

312
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I'll take care of you all my life.

313
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
But I really don't want

314
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,720
another marriage.

315
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
But I give you my word.

316
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,870
I'll try my best to give you

317
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,120
all the other things you want.

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,910
What can you give me?

319
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,600
Keep me company all the time?

320
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,030
Or stay with me

321
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,910
for the rest of your life?

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
You can't even give my marriage.

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
What do I need

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
your promises for?

325
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,080
Forget it.

326
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,960
I won't give you a hard time. Let it be.

327
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,030
Why did you not fight for the bouquet?

328
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,880
A bridal bouquet represents love and beauty.

329
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,000
I have both. Why would I fight for it?

330
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,310
This is

331
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,880
a good model answer.

332
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,750
That is my truth.

333
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,480
You don't think

334
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm still sad, do you?

335
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,240
No.

336
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,310
I just fear it may stir up your feelings.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,310
A saying goes like this.

338
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,680
"Before leaving the wrong guy,

339
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,310
we can't meet a Mr. Right."

340
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,640
So, I'm your Mr. Right.

341
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,070
What do you think?

342
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
Many people spend a lifetime

343
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,720
looking for something that pleases them.

344
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,480
When I'm with you,

345
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
my heart beats faster.

346
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to spend my life with you like this.

347
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,680
You can't be proposing to me, can you?

348
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
What are you thinking?

349
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,070
I don't want our proposing anniversary

350
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,640
to be their wedding anniversary.

351
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
When will you propose to me, then?

352
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,440
If you want it,

353
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,270
I can do it now.

354
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,950
Ji Xing,

355
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,800
will you...?

356
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,790
Will you take my car home?

357
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,720
Annoying. I'll take a taxi.

358
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,350
Just kidding.

359
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
Are you going or not?

360
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,590
Will you take a bike?

361
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,790
I'll take a tricycle.

362
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Now, you're watching

363
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,270
- the wedding of my friends,
- Wait.

364
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,510
Miss Wei Qiuzi

365
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,680
and Mr. Shao Yichen.

366
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,200
These little accessories
are of the palace style.

367
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,310
And this is my friend.

368
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
Pretty, huh?

369
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,870
Hello.

370
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,830
Xiaomeng, come to my bar.

371
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,790
I'm busy. I won't go.

372
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
You said you liked Dashu, right?

373
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,480
I have him sing at my bar.

374
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,560
Be right there.

375
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,280
Dashu!

376
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,300
♪It was the first snow♪

377
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,200
It's really him.

378
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,790
It's Mr. Dashu.

379
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,510
See? I'm awesome, huh?

380
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,750
I know you like him.

381
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,000
I have him here for you.

382
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,280
Don't say anything.

383
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,350
Just listen.

00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,720
♪You look a little bit silent♪

386
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,510
It's the first time I've seen him personally.

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,110
He's more handsome than he is on TV.

388
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,440
I don't agree.

389
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,000
Shh. Don't talk.

00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,680
Do you think I can take a photo

396
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
with Mr. Dashu?

397
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,680
That's not necessary.

398
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,790
Mr. Dashu.

399
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,790
May I take a photo with you?

400
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,630
Sure.

401
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,910
Lu Linjia.

402
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,000
Take a photo of us.

403
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,110
Mr. Dashu,

404
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,310
the audition is almost done.

405
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,320
Thank you.

406
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,550
I'll contact you later.

407
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,590
OK.

408
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,790
Thanks for today.

409
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,840
Lu Linjia,

410
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
you only took one photo?

411
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,550
I wanted a photo with my idol,

412
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,640
but you did a selfie.

413
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,000
The three of us are in the photo now.

414
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,400
Isn't he also in it?

415
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,680
Zoom up and he's gone!

416
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,590
There'll be more chances.

417
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,760
Tell me.

418
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,030
Is Dashu your cup of tea?

419
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,640
What are you talking about?

420
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,440
I just admire his talent.

421
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,200
Then tell me. What kind of man do you like?

422
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,830
Why did you say
we would be brother and sister?

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,030
Why on earth do you keep

424
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,510
asking questions?

425
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,720
You used to like Snow White.

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,800
What if you like Snow Black later?

427
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,830
You're so changeable.

428
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,070
Why did you always bring up Snow White?

429
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,880
Tell me. Do I have a chance?

430
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,110
No, for the moment.

431
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,520
Xiaomeng.

432
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,150
Xiaomeng.

433
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,870
Where are you going?

434
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,110
To see Dashu.

435
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,030
I'll prove my love over time.

436
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,510
Why are you back so late?

437
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,920
And you're so drunk.

438
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
Li Li.

439
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,670
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,630
That day,

441
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,680
I shouldn't have said that.

442
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,200
I didn't care about your feelings.

443
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
My apologies.

444
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,720
Did you not care

445
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,790
or did you not want to care?

446
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,440
Don't be mad, Li Li.

447
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,640
You really matter a lot to me.

448
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
You know what?

449
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,510
Every time you feel sad for me,

450
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,200
I'll feel even worse.

451
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,590
I haven't had this feeling for a long time.

452
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,000
I can't give you a family.

453
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,750
But this ring

454
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,270
shows my love for you.

455
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't leave me, will you?

456
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,240
Xiao Yixiao,

457
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,200
let's break up.

458
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,830
Why must a relationship

459
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,030
be defined and maintained

460
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,510
through marriage?

461
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Ms. Yuan,

462
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,240
Xingchen Technology

463
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,440
will start its Series A financing soon.

464
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,680
You're not going

465
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,240
to let Han Ting continue, are you?

466
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,000
What is destined to happen will happen.

467
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,510
We can't always stop it.

468
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,680
Why are you so anxious?

469
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,350
Getting along with such a tough man

470
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,720
like Han Ting

471
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,640
is like a tightrope act.

472
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,070
I can't help feeling anxious.

473
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,440
Mr. Zhou, this is crazy.

474
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,030
Even if Xingchen gets financing,

475
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,000
Han Ting can't fulfill his pledge

476
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,830
to double the stock price.

477
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,400
But I always think

478
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,590
Han Ting's pledge

479
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,830
can't be that simple.

480
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,750
When he was back from Germany,

481
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,400
he was so confident.

482
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,790
And he invested in Xingchen

483
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,000
after he made his pledge.

484
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,560
Think about it.

485
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,440
Could he have some other plans

486
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,830
before he came back?

487
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,720
Ms. Yuan, Mr. Zhou.

488
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,790
I hear Yang Qiong, the former product director

489
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,590
of Dongyang Medical,

490
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,590
has been resentful since he was

491
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,720
deployed to Dongyang Base.

492
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,400
He thought he was replaced by Luo Ping

493
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,160
because Mr. Han excluded his dissidents.

494
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,590
I'm thinking if we can have him

495
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,440
get more information.

496
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,310
Maybe he can get a lot

497
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,590
that we aren't aware of.

498
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,030
Let's make use of Yang Qiong, then.

499
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,670
Got it.

500
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,550
- Mr. Han.
- Sit.

501
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,640
What do you want me for?

502
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,630
Mr. Han,

503
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,030
a subordinate of mine

504
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,790
applied for the Pioneer Project.

505
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
I really didn't know

506
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,790
we would replace Xingchen.

507
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,830
I'm so sorry.

508
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
So, this is why you want to see me.

509
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm always professional.

510
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,350
Yes, of course.

511
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,240
I certainly believe you, Mr. Han.

512
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,640
Hanhai and Xingchen are competitors.

513
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Even if you, Mr. Chen,

514
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,270
applied for it personally,

515
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
that would be a very normal

516
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,940
market behavior.

517
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,310
I just fear Miss Ji will misunderstand us.

518
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,070
What scares you?

519
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,680
You and Miss Ji are in a relationship.

520
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I don't want

521
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,030
to offend your future wife.

522
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,510
Mr. Han,

523
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,200
what did I say wrong?

524
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,210
Nothing.

525
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,070
I just sighed.

526
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,440
Even a man like you

527
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,480
who pursues technical dreams

528
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,400
can also be overcautious

529
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,640
for this worldly wisdom thing.

530
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,960
- Have some tea.
- OK.

531
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,630
Mr. Han,

532
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,070
I heard

533
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,790
Xingchen would start

534
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,400
Series A financing, huh?

535
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,870
Yes.

536
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,720
Mr. Han, don't blame me for nagging.

537
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,480
Xingchen and Hanhai

538
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,200
fought for the Pioneer Project

539
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
and it was just the start.

540
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,790
I'm worried

541
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,160
more things like this

542
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,030
will happen in the future.

543
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,350
It's not convenient to reveal

544
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,680
your relationship with Hanhai.

545
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,680
And Miss Ji is your girlfriend.

546
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,350
In terms of our competition

547
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,440
with Xingchen,

548
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,680
I really don't know how far to go.

549
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,680
You once mentioned

550
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,480
to merge Hanhai and Xingchen.

551
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,200
If I want this plan to continue,

552
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,480
what do you say?

553
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,070
That's great.

554
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,030
But it's not a pure merger,

555
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,590
but an organic integration.

556
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,030
Keep Hanhai's comprehensiveness

557
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,200
as well as Xingchen's innovativeness.

558
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,590
Think about it before you reply.

559
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,790
I don't need to.

560
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm OK with it.

561
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
When I'm back, I'll work out

562
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
the merger proposal.

563
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,880
I'll let you know.

564
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,630
OK.

565
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm on it now.

566
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,190
Xing.

567
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,510
Did you see?

568
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,720
Hanhai replaced us in the Pioneer Project.

569
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,590
Yichen told me.

570
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,680
But we were verified

571
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,440
for that project, weren't we?

572
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,440
Be seated.

573
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,640
We were verified.

574
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,720
But at the very last moment,

575
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,070
Hanhai applied, too.

576
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,680
And they got the spot.

577
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,000
Do we still stand a chance

578
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,110
to fight for it?

579
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,640
What is the reason

580
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
for our disqualification?

581
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,240
Hanhai is more famous.

582
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,200
This is normal.

583
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,070
Then why didn't they

584
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,790
just give Hanhai the spot?

585
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,200
Why did they offer an open application?

586
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,110
Besides, doesn't this project

587
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,110
help small and medium-sized businesses?

588
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,920
Look at it this way.

589
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,640
It also proves

590
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,310
our company has grown better.

591
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,270
Even Hanhai takes us

592
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,720
as its competitor.

593
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,910
Come in.

594
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,680
Miss Ji, Mr. Chang of Tongke is here.

595
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,400
I have him wait for you in the meeting room.

596
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,520
OK.

597
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,830
Xing,

598
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,240
what is Chang He doing here?

599
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,200
When I see him, I'll know.

600
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,510
I should go.

601
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,590
OK.

602
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
Miss Ji,

603
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm here uninvited.

604
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,310
Am I disturbing your work?

605
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Not at all. Mr. Chang,

606
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,920
your presence is an honor.

607
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,440
Before getting down to business,

608
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,000
I want to apologize to you.

609
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,000
When we had dinner last time,

610
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,030
I saw you and Mr. Han.

611
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,310
In a good mood, I drank too much.

612
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,070
Later, I got to know

613
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,510
Mr. Han was allergic to alcohol.

614
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,830
I nearly forgot it.

615
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,070
No discord, no concord.

616
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
Miss Ji,

617
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,510
you know what I'm here for,

618
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,200
don't you?

619
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,750
Does my company stand a chance

620
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,510
for your Series A financing?

621
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,640
Either you think I want to use Xingchen

622
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,720
to make some money

623
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,070
or you think

624
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,590
I seek cooperation

625
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,790
to develop a new manufacturing model,

626
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,000
what I expect is some progress.

627
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,480
It'll be a win-win, right?

628
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,640
You have a point, Mr. Chang.

629
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,870
But

630
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,000
Xingchen's every big decision

631
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,790
is regulated by Mr. Han.

632
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,310
It's OK. I don't invest in Xingchen

633
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,030
to kick Dongyang Medical out.

634
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,110
I don't mind cooperating with him.

635
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,440
And I think you and Mr. Han

636
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,030
can separate your career
from your relationship.

637
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,240
My competition and my investment

638
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,270
are very different things.

639
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,030
For a merchant,

640
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,790
the top priority is always

641
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,400
the maximum profits of his company.

642
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,400
No offense,

643
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,640
but love is changeable.

644
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,790
I know many businesswomen

645
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,720
who sacrificed their interests for love

646
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,160
but were hurt in the end.

647
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,310
Some other businesswomen

648
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,590
can also coordinate work and love very well.

649
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,110
I'm sure you understand.

650
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,430
I do.

651
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,030
I want maximum profits, of course.

652
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,720
Either Mr. Han

653
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,640
or any other investor...

654
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Maybe they can offer more profits

655
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,830
than you do.

656
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,720
And of course,

657
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,240
we may cooperate with you

658
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,080
in the end.

659
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,590
Business negotiations take time.

660
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,110
If you say other investors

661
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,720
are more competitive, I'll believe it.

662
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,910
But Han Ting...

663
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,110
My investment

664
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
only leads to fractional shares.

665
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,400
Xingchen will still be yours.

666
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,440
But Han Ting will centralize the shares.

667
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,190
Xingchen will be his.

668
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,590
To be honest,

669
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,670
I think a neutral third party is the best

670
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,590
for our Series A financing.

671
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,320
Fine.

672
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,190
Let's talk in detail when possible.

673
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,320
But anyway,

674
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,960
I still want you

675
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,510
to think carefully about it.

676
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,840
See who gives you a better offer,

677
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,800
someone else or me.

678
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,950
OK.

679
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,200
Li.

680
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,190
What's up?

681
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,550
Are you available tonight?

682
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,000
I want to invite you to a movie.

683
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Why do you suddenly want that?

684
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,550
I hear

685
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,800
a comedy film has been on

686
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,000
and it's very popular.

687
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
I think

688
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,670
after you watch it,

689
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,070
you may feel happier.

690
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,030
It'll be my treat.

691
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,320
OK.

692
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,070
I'll get to work. See you after work.

693
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,240
Hello.

694
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,480
I'd like to see Miss Zeng.

695
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,670
OK. Come with me.

696
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,440
Miss Zeng, you've got a visitor.

697
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,120
Get him in.

698
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,920
Such a beautiful view here.

699
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,030
Mr. Chang?

700
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,670
What brings you here?

701
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,510
This is Dongyang Building.

702
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
It's my first time here.

703
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,360
Don't you give me a seat?

704
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
My place

705
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,840
is your territory, too.

706
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,510
You flatter me.

707
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,710
I texted you, but you didn't reply.

708
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,800
I had to come personally.

709
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,110
I was dealing with a contract

710
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,030
and didn't check my phone.

711
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,710
What's this?

712
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,110
I had my man pick you

713
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,070
some offices to choose from.

714
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,280
Pick one and tell me.

715
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,510
If you're not satisfied,

716
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,710
I'll look for more.

717
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,440
You want me to move away?

718
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,440
Why?

719
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,000
I haven't taken revenge yet.

720
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,000
Leave the revenge thing to me.

721
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,000
I just came out of Xingchen Technology.

722
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,510
Xingchen?

723
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,670
What were you doing there?

724
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,720
To see Ji Xing.

725
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,590
I talked with her about Series A financing.

726
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,230
This is the way you avenge me?

727
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,510
You don't like it?

728
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,480
Unless Ji Xing falls out with Han Ting,

729
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,840
she won't accept your offer.

730
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,320
Nothing is absolute.

731
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,030
To achieve something,

732
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,230
we can always find a way.

733
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,000
OK. I'll be right there.

734
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,230
Li, here's the coffee.

735
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,590
I have an emergency.

736
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm sorry.

737
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,920
We'll watch it another day.

738
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,510
For Xiao Yixiao?

739
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,190
This gentleman is drunk.

740
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,630
Because he's our boss's friend,

741
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,840
we don't dare to move him.

742
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
You're the emergency contact on his phone.

743
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,800
We had to call you.

744
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,710
Thanks. I got it.

745
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,510
Xiao Yixiao.

746
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,510
Xiao Yixiao, wake up!

747
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,920
There you are.

748
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,840
I'll drive you back.

749
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,070
Where will you drive me?

750
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,190
To your place or mine?

751
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,550
Xiao Yixiao,

752
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,590
since you can't give me what I want,

753
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,710
let's not contact anymore.

754
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,000
We're over.

755
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,590
Then why are you here?

756
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,320
Li Li,

757
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,230
let's get back together.

758
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,280
OK.

759
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,510
Really?

760
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,280
Marry me tomorrow.

761
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,590
I got you a designated driver.

762
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,070
You go back home alone.

763
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,780
(Dongyang Group)

764
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,510
Zhong.

765
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,840
You called me in a hurry.

766
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,680
What happened?

767
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,920
Mr. Su, I had meant to work overtime

768
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,440
to sort out the quotation.

769
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,190
But suddenly, my monitor went black.

770
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,070
When I restarted it,

771
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,590
the file was gone.

772
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,030
Don't panic. Let me check.

773
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:12,670
I think I can solve it.

774
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,030
I'm sorry, Mr. Su.

775
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,190
I had meant

776
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,190
to ask our webmasters for help.

777
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,590
But they were off work.

778
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,630
I had to call you, then.

779
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,840
It's OK. I'm available.

780
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,980
(Windows can't find "mscofig".
Confirm and try again.)

781
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,740
(Quotation)

782
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,280
Done.

783
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,800
Thank you so much, Mr. Su.

784
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,110
You did me a big favor.

785
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
If you don't mind,

786
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,230
I should go.

787
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,200
Mr. Su.

788
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,600
Anything else?

789
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,590
I like you.

790
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,440
You...

791
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,190
I know you adore Miss Li.

792
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,400
So, I just want you to know

793
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,800
how I feel for you.

794
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,590
Since I came here,

795
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,070
you've helped me a lot.

796
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,840
Since then,

797
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,070
I've been in love with you.

798
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,510
You're the vice general manager,

799
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,880
but you don't put on airs.

800
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,550
When you work,

801
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,190
you're so serious.

802
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,190
I hope

803
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,630
you'll consider me.
