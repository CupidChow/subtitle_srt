Don't push it.

Everybody is at the table.

35
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,240
Why are you still checking your phone?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,680
You fool around all the time.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,430
What kind of girl would like you?

38
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,840
Don't worry. If no girls like me,

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll accompany you forever.

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,870
It's good for Linjia to be so dutiful.

41
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,710
Brother, don't say that.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,800
What if he's forever single?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Right?

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,590
Mr. Han, all the dishes are served.

45
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,710
OK.

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,630
Where's Ting?

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,590
Didn't you go get him to dinner?

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,080
He left for something urgent.

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,000
What's so urgent?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,970
It's the New Year's Eve.

51
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,280
Why did he not have dinner first?

52
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,870
It's about Xingchen, I guess.

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,030
Xingchen?

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,430
He invested twenty million in Xingchen.

55
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,080
He offered the money, fine.

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Now, he's even offering himself.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Yuan,

58
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,150
you're Ting's cousin

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,630
and you should help him.

60
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,750
He's just back in China

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000
and don't let anyone fool him.

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,910

63

Ting always

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,190
knows how far to go.

66
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,280
Come on. Let's eat.

67
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Eat.

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,120

72
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,350
Thanks.

73
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,920
Hi, Mr. Han.

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
Why did you not answer the phone?

75
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,510
My phone is dead. What's up?

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,630
I'm on my way back.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,070
Don't worry.

78
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,160
It's the New Year's Eve

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,360
and why did you run about?

80
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,870
Without Han,

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,430
we wouldn't have found you.

82
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,240
OK. I get it.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,750
Talk when I'm back. Bye.

84
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,120
I didn't know

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,600
why my parents came so unexpectedly.

86
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,750
Sorry for the trouble.

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,000
It's OK. Glad you're not lost.

88
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,160

91

Why did you not

92
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,040
tell me earlier?

93
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Because of your mother.

94
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,680
She wanted to give you a surprise.

95
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Come on.

96
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,600
- Han.
- Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Thank you.

98
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,600
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

99
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,310
Mr. Han, give it to me.

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
Sorry to have troubled you.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,640
Go back home.

102

it's the New Year's Eve.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Han was looking around for you.

105
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,680
Now, it's so late.

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
We can't let him

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,070
go home hungry, can we?

108
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,920
That's right.

109
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
You also know what day it is?

110

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,430
Han, do you have any plans for tonight?

113
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
No, actually.

114
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,270
That's great.

115
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,510
Stay and have dinner.

116

117
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah. Drink with me.

118
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,070

119

- OK.
- Give it to me.

127

No need. The kitchen is too small.

128
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,920
Make yourself at home.

129

Let's call it Dahuang.

It's Dahuang?

139

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,120
He's warm-hearted, too.

190
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,870
Yeah. And he's handsome.

191
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,600
The more I look at Han, the more I like him.

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,910
I think he and Xing

193
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,240
make a perfect couple.

194
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,840
Come on, stop daydreaming.

195
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,750
Han appears

196
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,200
to be easygoing.

197
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,080
But he's a CEO, after all.

198
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,600
How can he be perfect for Xing?

199
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,670
Xing is good, too.

200
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,150
She has a company now.

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
She works in Xinggang all alone.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,030
If she's in love with Han,

203
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,510
she can be taken good care of.

204
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,350
Understand?

205
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,510
You're really thinking too much.

206
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,840
It's the fate thing, actually.

207
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,680
Besides,

208
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,270
it doesn't matter what we think.

209
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,840
What matters is how the two of them think.

210
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,670
You have a point.

211
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,870
It's been years. You still recognize him?

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,390
You don't struggle at all. Good cat.

213
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,200
Because I'm charming.

214
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,320
Because Dahuang has a good memory.

215
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,320
Why did I not see it last time?

216
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,750
Last time?

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,790
Come on. Let's keep drinking.

218
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,790
I'll sing you a song.

219
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,320
♪I want nobody, nobody but you♪

220
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,840
OK. Another day.

221
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,960
Get down here.

222
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
♪Come back♪

223
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,440
Bye-bye!

224
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,510
No idea. Maybe it didn't want to see you.

225
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
You told me you would go home.

226
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,200
Now, you're much better

227
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,230
at fooling me.

228
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,200
If Mr. and Mrs. Ji hadn't come,

229
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,960
what would you do tonight?

230
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I'd stay in my office,

231
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,910
work overtime and have dinner.

232
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
How did you know I was in Xingyue Club?

233
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,600
Xiao Yixiao told me.

234
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,750
Thanks for today.

235
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,510
Dahuang has been really plump.

236
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,800
So heavy.

237
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,120
You left without telling anyone.

238
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,200
Without me,

239
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,030
it would have been dead.

240
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,710
It's been ten years.

241
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
I just didn't know

242
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,630
I could see you again.

243
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,790
It's all good.

244
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,670
It is.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
Look. It's nice and plump.

246
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
It does nothing but eat.

247
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,550
Such a happy life.

248
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,870
Xing, come serve the dishes.

249
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Coming.

250
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,390
Twelve dishes in total.

251
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,870
A lucky even number.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,320
I didn't mean to order so much.

253
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,840
Mr. Xiao gave me a lot more.

254
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,480
For Mr. Han's sake.

255
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,480
What are you waiting for? Let's eat.

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,270
Han, don't stand on ceremony.

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,670
Make yourself at home.

258
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,150
- OK. Thanks.
- Here. Eat.

259
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,510
Yeah. We don't have too many rules.

260
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,710
Just be comfortable.

261
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,040
Taste this.

262
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,630
The most delicious beef ball in the world.

263
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,470
My father made it.

264
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,600
You're so honey-lipped.

265
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,600
Come on, Han.

266
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,030
Drink with me.

267
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
- Come on.
- Sorry, Mr. Ji.

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,870
I'm allergic to alcohol.

269
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,680
You don't drink wine?

270
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,080
That's great.

271
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
You drink alone, then.

272
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,630
OK. I'll drink alone.

273
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,550
Let me drink with you.

274
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,790
- OK.
- I'll drink.

275
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,710
Cheers.

276
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,270
The dishes taste very good.

277
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,600
But not as good as before.

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
Maybe

279
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,720
the previous cook has a day off.

280
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,000
When you want some dishes,

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,840
let me know.

282
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
I'll have the chef cook for you.

283
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,480
OK. Thank you, Mr. Han.

284
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,200
It's so good to celebrate together.

285
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,310
Last year, we had it with...

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,640
So many dishes. Just eat.

287
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Come on.

288
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,070
New year, new start.

289
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,200
Let's drink together.

290
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,110
- That's right.
- Cheers.

291
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,400
Happy Chinese New Year!

292
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,440
I'm grateful to my work

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
for keeping me busy all day long.

294
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
I sleep the minute I get into bed.

295
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,550
As time goes by, something has

296
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,390
faded away.

297
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm doing good now.

298
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Very good.

299
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,480
Exactly.

300
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,920
I believe my daughter

301
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,720
will meet her Mr. Right.

302
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,480
Yeah. That's right.

303
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,880
Your Mr. Right

304
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,240
is yet to come.

305
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,440
Come on. Let's drink again.

306
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

307
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,070
Han, welcome.

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,000
Thanks.

309
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,110
Taste this.

310
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,680
My father marinated it.

311
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,630
And this.

312
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,070
Pot-stewed food from my hometown.

313
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,070
Really delicious.

314
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,400
My father brings some every time he comes.

315
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,320
Taste it. Get some.

316
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,390
Here it is.

317
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
Xing,

318
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,160
I hear there'll be a fireworks show

319
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,880
on the New Year's Eve in Xinggang.

320
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
After dinner, take Han there to have a look.

321
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Don't be stuck at home.

322
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,830
When we're done cleaning, we'll watch TV.

323
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,920
Watch the gala, huh?

324
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,190
Yeah.

325
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,350
Your mother and I

326
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,830
will spend some time alone.

327
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,830
You guys go have fun.

328
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,030
Mr. Han, won't you go home to stay up late?

329
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,720
I'll do it with you.

330
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,800
Nothing different.

331
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,280
OK.

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Good. Come on.

333
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,720
The drumstick Xing loves most.

334
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,030
- Taste it.
- Thanks.

335
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,070
One for you.

336
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,720
- I don't want it.
- Let's drink.

337
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,790
To Mr. Han's staying with us for dinner.

338
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,830
OK. Welcome, Han.

339
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,830
Hope you'll come often.

340
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,310
Hello, sweethearts.

341
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,030
Welcome to my live-streaming room.

342
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,400
This is Smart Lemon.

343
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,480
For the new year,

344
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,720
wish you prosperity

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,000
and good luck.

346
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,590
Tonight, I won't sing songs.

347
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,920
I'll do something special.

348
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,240
Let me show you

349
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,920
my New Year's Eve dinner.

350
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,790
Jiaozi.

351
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,880
I made it all by myself.

352
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,920
This is radish wrapper.

353
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,790
This is spinach wrapper.

354
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,110
This is the original wrapper.

355
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Nice jiaozi.

356
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,550
Yeah. Really nice.

357
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,440
Thanks for your compliments.

358
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
If you're interested,

359
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,550
I will make a video

360
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,680
for the next episode

361
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,200
where I teach you how to make it.

362
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,310
Actually, this...

363
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,000
Why, Ms. Han? You freaked me out.

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,510
Everybody is in the dining room.

365
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,830
But you are checking your phone here.

366
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,030
Do you think it's appropriate?

367
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,830
Oh, Miss Xiaomeng.

368
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,920
So, you're watching her live-streaming?

369
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,790
I don't mean to watch it.

370
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,310
The app recommended it.

371
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,510
Fine. I get it.

372
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,270
I know Miss Xiaomeng.

373
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,830
Do you need to hide from me

374
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,350
- when watching her?
- Give it back.

375
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,630
Let me watch for a while.

376
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,200
I've never watched it before.

377
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,550
Go get me a pack of spicy sticks.

378
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,110
What? How long will you watch?

379
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,200
A while. Just a while.

380
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,240
Go. I haven't eaten it for long.

381
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,200
Good son, go ahead.

382
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,240
Don't stand in my way.

383
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,520
Don't click anything.

384
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,480
I know.

385
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
How adorable!

386
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,110
Simply speaking...

387
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, she can't see me.

388
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,920
When you're in love,

389
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,270
you must taste this sweet filling.

390
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,270
For sweet love.

391
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,310
If you want a good career,

392
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,790
take the chestnut flavor.

393
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,720
Do you know what it implies?

394
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,830
Good luck.

395
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
And this one with some date.

396
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,790
Such a detailed introduction.

397
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,160
Very professional.

398
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,070
And the most common type.

399
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,510
A coin in it.

400
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,920
Pay attention.

401
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,110
Do disinfect the coin

402
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,030
with boiling water

403
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,200
before you put it in.

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,240
Smart Lemon, can I use paper money?

405
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,070
You can't, sweetheart.

406
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,110
Coin.

407
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,720
Everybody wants a good omen, right?

408
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,640
The tinkle of coin.

409
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,550
Everybody, I hope

410
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
you'll be prosperous in the new year,

411
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
make a big fortune,

412
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,590
and earn a lot of money.

413
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,160
Just like my best friends.

414
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,480
Is everybody watching the gala?

415
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,510
They don't have time for me.

416
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,790
Very few viewers now.

417
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,480
Don't be sad.

418
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,750
It's the New Year's Eve.

419
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,680
I'll give you a gift

420
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,510
as a good omen.

421
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
Where is the gift I want?

422
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,790
But it's OK.

423
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,350
Oh, it's here.

424
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,640
This one is good. For the full screen.

425
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,830
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lu,

426
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,200
for your gift.

427
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,240
May you always be happy in the new year.

428
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,100
(Carnival)

429
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,800
Such a good gift.

430
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
Oh, cutie.

431
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,400
Thanks.

432
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,960
Thank you again, Mr. Lu,

433
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,480
for your continuous gifts.

434
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,790
Thank you so much.

435
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,270
In the new year,

436
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,780
(Isn't he Snow White's fan?)
wish you a great career,

437
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,130
(He once satirized Lemon.)
a fancy business,

438
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,440
(Is his account hacked?)
and a happy life.

439
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
All right. It's getting late.

440
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,200
You'll get back to your family.

441
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,510
I'll stop the live-streaming, too.

442
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,270
Bye-bye. See you next time.

443
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,830
- OK.
- Thank you.

444
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,640
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Happy Chinese New Year, sir.

445
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,900
(Roast sweet potatoes)

446
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
Thanks.

447
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,590
When I was in college,

448
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,000
I loved the roast sweet potatoes
outside the school gate.

449
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,510
Have you decided where to move your office?

450
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,080
Not yet.

451
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
We saw some offices.

452
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,680
The satisfactory ones have a very rent.

453
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,030
Move to Dongyang.

454
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,800
Dongyang?

455
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,960
Are you kidding me?

456
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,480
That's such an expensive place.

457
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
We can't afford one.

458
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,880
A company

459
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,270
invested by Dongyang

460
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,590
will have its IPO.

461
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,350
It has moved away for expanded business.

462
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,270
You can use their office.

463
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
As for the rent,

464
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,840
you'll have a discount.

465
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,870
Really?

466
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,880
Thank you, boss.

467
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,070
For the sake of your recent working attitude,

468
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,960
the second batch of eight million...

469
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,510
After the Spring Festival,

470
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,240
you can apply for it.

471
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,310
I'll approve four million first

472
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,550
in case you take money from me

473
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,920
but claim to be short of money.

474
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,110
You're indeed

475
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,480
my angel investor.

476
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,070
I have demands.

477
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,400
Don't worry.

478
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,790
Before the agreement expires,

479
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,070
I'll complete the product experiment.

480
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,080
I trust you.

481
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,790
I will not break your trust.

482
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,830
Hope Xingchen will become better.

483
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,200
Why do you make a wish to fireworks?

484
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,750
Fireworks look most like meteors.

485
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,350
Make wishes to fireworks

486
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,830
and all of them will come true.

487
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,510
Ji Xing, may all your wishes come true.

488
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,640
Thank you, Mr. Han. The same to you.

489
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,070
Don't call me Mr. Han in private.

490
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,430
Call me Han Ting.

491
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,590
Happy Chinese New Year, Han Ting.

492
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,240
Wow, splendid.

493
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,200
I just gave Miss Xiaomeng

494
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,590
some gifts.

495
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,640
What's your look?

496
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,680
(Gifts)
Son, look. Xiaomeng

497
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,960
has got so many gifts

498
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,830
and how happy will she be!

499
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,960
Ms. Han.

500
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,350
Who? Who called me?

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,240
Do you hear? Someone called me.

502
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,630
Who?

503
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,240
This family

504
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,030
can't do without me.

505
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,350
Coming.

506
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,640
Who called me? What's up?

507
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,750
(Will she think I have feelings for her?)

508
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,240
Don't get me wrong.

509
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,510
(Lu Linjia)

510
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,880
(Will I even make it worse?)

511
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,140
(Recall)

512
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,110
(There must be an unknown reason.)

513
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
(What is Lu Linjia up to?)

514
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,660
(Lu recalled a message.)

515
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
(What did he recall?)

516
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,550
(No way. I should text him first.)

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,550
(Smart Lemon)
Stop hesitating. I understand.

518
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,510
I know you had a slip of the hand.

519
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,400
Regretting it, huh?

520
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,750
I'll give you the money back.

521
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,680
She's obviously

522
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,750
despising me.

523
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,960
Funny.

524
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,200
(Lu Linjia)
Don't give it back.

525
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm happy to do that.

526
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,820
(Dongyang Group)

527
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,590
Xing, you're back in triumph.

528
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,080
That's right.

529
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,030
Isn't it too early to say

530
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,030
if it's a final triumph?

531
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
Mr. Han.

532
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,520
Mr. Han.

533
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
Why do you not get up there?

534
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm waiting for my colleagues.

535
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,310
You go up. You have to open the door.

536
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,640
I'll stay and wait for them.

537
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,680
It's OK. I...

538
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,520
Just go.

539
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,590
OK.

540
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,500
(Dongyang Group)

541
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,440
In a good mood, huh?

542
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
When I'm back here now,

543
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
I do have different feelings

544
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,030
from those a few months ago.

545
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,960
You feel proud, right?

546
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
Kind of.

547
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Since we decided to move

548
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
to Dongyang,

549
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,640
we've received many more resumes.

550
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,240
From new graduates

551
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,350
or newbies, right?

552
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,310
Newbies are good.

553
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,640
They're vigorous with dreams.

554
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,680
And they don't have bad working habits.

555
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,920
So, Xingchen aims to be

556
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,750
a training place for employees.

557
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,640
What's this?

558
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,680
Dahuang's alimony for the past ten years.

559
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,640
From now on, you and I will share

560
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,750
its living expenses.

561
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,680
No need. I can raise it myself.

562
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,830
It's for Dahuang.

563
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,200
Send me its life photos regularly.

564
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,720
I want to know how it lives.

565
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,190
OK.

566
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,860
(Stored-value Card)

567
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,790
Wait, wait!

568
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,920
Mr. Han.

569
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,790
Xing.

570
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,080
Weiwei.

571
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,920
Are you moving in here?

572
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,310
You know it?

573
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,240
Everybody in Guanghua

574
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,750
knows it now.

575
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You got some investment

576
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,750
and now you're a boss.

577
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,070
You're a legend in Guanghua.

578
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,030
Everybody is jealous of you.

579
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,310
Legend? That's crazy.

580
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm just lucky.

581
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,550
Now, we're pretty close.

582
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,510
- Shall we have lunch together when possible?
- OK.

583
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,310
- Here I am. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

584
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,510
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

585
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,150
See you, Mr. Han.

586
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,350
Come on, legend.

587
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,580
(Dongyang Group)

588
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,430
Xing,

589
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,270
why are you calling so early?

590
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,030
Today, we're moving to a new office.

591
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,000
Let me show you.

592
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,440
Big, isn't it?

593
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,240
Isn't it?

594
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,000
My office is over there.

595
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,680
You've got an office?

596
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,750
That's great.

597
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,480
Ji, come over here.

598
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
Your father is making breakfast.

599
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,350
Come have a look.

600
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
- At what?
- Your daughter's office.

601
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,310
It's really big.

602
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,960
Let's visit her someday.

603
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,800
OK.

604
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
But Xing,

605
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,160
you must always remember.

606
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,070
Never get arrogant.

607
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,480
Don't flatter yourself

608
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,590
too much.

609
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,680
You can't waste

610
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,480
Han's investment, right?

611
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,200
OK. I get it.

612
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,200
Look who is here.

613
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

614
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,110
Hi, Li Li.

615
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,750
You look more beautiful.

616
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,830
Thanks, Mrs. Ji.

617
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,240
The two of you should take care of each other.

618
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,920
When you're there to help Xing,

619
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,070
we'll be relieved.

620
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,750
Now, she is my boss.

621
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,000
She always helps me.

622
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,270
We help each other.

623
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,160
OK. I'll say no more. We'll get to work.

624
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,680
Bye-bye, Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

625
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,550
OK.

626
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,880
- Bye.
- See you.

627
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,200
This is for your new office.

628
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
Bluebell Cologne. Fresh smell.

629
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,830
Li, how come you always know

630
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,670
what I want?

631
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
Don't be excited.

632
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,550
It's a giveaway from the checkup card

633
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,640
I bought for Su Zhizhou.

634
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,750
Why did you buy him a checkup card?

635
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,510
For the Spring Festival,

636
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,790
he bought presents for everybody.

637
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,160
You both had cushions

638
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,070
while I had expensive skincare products.

639
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,720
I don't want to owe him anything.

640
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,640
So, I bought the card in return.

641
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,000
The checkup card.

642
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,510
It's only available for once.

643
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,920
He'll understand what I mean, right?

644
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,110
Then he'll stop

645
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,070
wasting time on me.

646
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,070
Well, so sad for Zhizhou.

647
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,960
Why don't you feel sad for me?

648
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,270
Do I need to?

649
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,440
Yes, of course.

650
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,510
So many men pursue you.

651
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,720
Why would I feel sad for you?

652
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,270
It makes sense.

653
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,910
I'll go pick someone up.

654
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,750
I'm going back to my new office.

655
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,590
OK.

656
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,960
I feel as if I was dreaming.

657
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,880
I have my own office.

658
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,110
It's so big.

659
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,720
I guess it's how it feels

660
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,240
when your dream comes true.

661
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,160
- Li?
- Miss Li.

662
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,920
You guys talk. I'll get to work.

663
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,720
Here.

664
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,790
You bought me such expensive skincare products.

665
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't buy me anything so expensive again.

666
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,200
This is a present in return.

667
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,510
Thank you, Li.

668
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,830
It's so nice of you.

669
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,590
It's a checkup card.

670
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,350
You...

671
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,680
Why did you tell me?

672
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,030
Shouldn't I guess?

673
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
A present in return

674
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,270
focus on courtesy

675
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,480
instead of surprise.

676
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,750
I'll get to work.

677
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,550
OK. Thanks, Li.

678
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,300
(Checkup Card)

679
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,110
Checkup Card.

680
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,830
Li must be caring about my health.

681
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,780
(Xingchen Technology)

682
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,310
Look who is here.

683
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Xia?

684
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Hello, there. I'm back.

685
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,760
Sorry.

686
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,510
For some reason,

687
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,880
I left when Xingchen was in big trouble.

688
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,750
Now, it's on track

689
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,680
and Xing still accepts me.

690
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,310
I invited Xia back.

691
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,510
She had a very good offer in a big company.

692
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,400
But she agreed to come back here

693
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,070
and set sail again with us.

694
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,590
Good. Xia, welcome back.

695
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,510
You're our technical backbone.

696
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,400
Hope you'll make a difference.

697
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,590
Hi, Xia.

698
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,310
I'm Li Li. Welcome back.

699
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,510
Hi, Li Li.

700
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,920
Xia, you still sit beside me.

701
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,310
We'll work hard together.

702
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,510
Come on. Let me help you.

703
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,400
- Thanks.
- Come on.

704
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
Here.

705
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
OK.

706
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,790
Now,

707
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,480
we have a good office environment.

708
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,070
You guys look around
and see what we'll do next.

709
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,880
Recruit employees.

710
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,510
That's right.

711
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,310
If those interviewees who rejected us

712
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,320
get to know

713
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,920
we've moved into such a good office,

714
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,590
they'll be regretting it.

715
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
Actually, some interviewees are good.

716
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
They're in our field, too.

717
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,590
How about we contact them again?

718
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,880
Why?

719
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,790
Employees

720
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,720
adapt to the environment

721
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
instead of the opposite way.

722
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,200
Before, they didn't value Xingchen.

723
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,160
Now, Xingchen

724
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,070
is too good for them.

725
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,670
It makes sense.

726
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,550
But we should call them.

727
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,200
Don't deny their talents

728
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,440
for such a small problem.

729
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,750
We need their talent.

730
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,510
- OK.
- Miss Ji.

731
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,800
You talk more like a boss now.

732
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,760
Now, let's be clear

733
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,960
about our functions.

734
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,030
I'm mainly in charge

735
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,280
of the overall administration.

736
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,110
Zhizhou is in charge of techniques.

737
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,000
Shang and Xia

738
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
give technical support

739
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,190
and report to Zhizhou.

740
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,280
Li Li is in charge of purchasing.

741
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,190
When our product is legally sold,

742
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,110
you'll do the sales.

743
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,840
Xing, I'll take Shang and Xia

744
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,800
to decorate the lab.

745
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
OK.

746
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,960
I'll go contact the suppliers.

747
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,550
Sure. Let's split up.

748
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,670
- OK.
- Come on.

749
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,510
Did you hear?

00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,510

751
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,360
has also moved in here.

752
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,360
Right above us.

753
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,480
Ji Xing is a boss now.

754
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
And I'm still an employee.

755
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Xingchen got financing

756
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,320
from Mr. Han.

757
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,840
Ji Xing has had her day.

758
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,190
She isn't what she used to be.

759
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,880
Now, she's an equal

760
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,360
with Miss Zeng.

761
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,340
Just like the saying goes,

762
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,860
every dog has his day.

763
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,780
Everyone's luck

764
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,020
changes all the time.

765
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,940
Who knows?

766
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,340
She may succeed for a while.

767
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,900
But she may not succeed forever.

768
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,020
Who? Who's coming over?

769
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,740
Miss Zeng?

770
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,940
Ji Xing.

771
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,860
Now, I should call you Miss Ji.

772
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,060
Congrats on your new office.

773
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,140
Thank you.

774
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,700
It's so nice of you.

775
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,580
(Boundless Plain with Stars?)

776
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
File of raw materials.

777
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,740
Do you know who she is?

778
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,300
No.

779
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,980
Xing's former boss,

780
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,660
Zeng Di from Guanghua.

781
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,060
Sit, Miss Zeng. I'll get you some water.

782
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,900
No, thanks.

783
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,220
I'm here to cheer for you.

784
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,260
Work hard.

785
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,740
After all, you used to work

786
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,580
for Guanghua.

787
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,700
You must not

788
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,940
disgrace us.

789
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,580
I'll do my best

790
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,340
and try hard not to disappoint you.

791
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Ambitious.

792
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,460
I'll wait and see.

793
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,820
OK.

794
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,380
Nice painting.

795
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,380
Let me walk you out.

796
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,140
Zhizhou,

797
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,540
check this painting.

798
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,580
Xing,

799
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,060
is this painting authentic?

800
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,020
It's from Han Ting. I think it's authentic.

801
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,060
This painter

802
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,380
has very few works.

803
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,100
This is the only painting he has sold

804
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,700
in the past five years.

805
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,340
Boundless Plain with Stars.

806
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,340
In the auction house, its final price is...

807
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,940
Seventy thousand?

808
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,700
- Seven figures!
- Seven figures!

809
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,220
If we had known about its price,

810
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,540
we could have sold it

811
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,940
when we were short of money.

812
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,540
We needn't have written codes so hard.

813
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,180
- It's...
- That's right.

814
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,940
I needn't have run about for new projects.

815
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,780
Yeah.

816
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,460
Don't touch it.

817
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,460
What if you stain it?

818
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,620
This isn't Mr. Han's painting.

819
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,740
It's actually his love.

820
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,220
Such extravagant love.

821
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,860
Don't say stuff like that.

822
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,340
Umm...

823
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,180
Han Ting and I are in no relationship.

824
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,340
Oh...

825
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,700
Mr. Han, you asked to see me?

826
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,620
Take your seat.

827
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,380
How long have you worked here?

828
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,900
For 13 years, Mr. Han.

829
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,300
Served as Zhang Xinhua's assistant

830
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,140
for seven or eight years, huh?

831
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,780
Ten years, exactly.

832
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,740
You're experienced with accomplishments.

833
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,820
If I make you the sales director,

834
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,660
what ideas do you have for the management

835
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
of the Sales Department?

836
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,660
Mr. Han,

837
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,700
I won't be a good top leader.

838
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,140
I'm quite satisfied

839
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,740
with what I am now.

840
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,820
When I make contributions to our company,

841
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,060
I don't care too much about positions.

842
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,740
You either forge ahead or fall behind.

843
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,900
I read your resume.

844
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,740
Do you really want

845
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,780
to be a deputy director all your life?

846
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,260
Mr. Han,

847
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,500
thank you for your appreciation.

848
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,100
But Zhang has promoted me.

849
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,020
I would rather resign

850
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,420
than stand against him.

851
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,820
Hope you can understand.

852
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,400
(Zhang consumed unreasonable money.)

853
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,220
(He transferred money
to Xinghua Technology for nothing.)

854
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,500
Mr... Mr. Han.

855
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,260
How...?

856
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,460
How are you going to deal with him?

857
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,180
Since he has promoted you,

858
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,980
I guess you know exactly

859
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,700
what you should do

860
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,420
to make him end up well.

861
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,140
I get it.

862
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,180
Thank you for your mercy.

863
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,540
You have to know.

864
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,620
Accepting my offer

865
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,820
will not hurt him,

866
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,940
but give him a way out.

867
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,540
When you're in his position, I believe

868
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,220
you'll learn from his lesson

869
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,900
and you won't make the same mistake.

870
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,180
If...

871
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,380
If I accept your offer...

872
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,780
Zhang started to work here earlier than me.

873
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,380
He's been working here for 15 years.

874
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,860
Without a bad influence on our company,

875
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,300
I'll give him a decent ending.

876
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Li, come over here.

877
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
Come and look.

878
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,420
It's such a fancy bag.

879
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,580
What bag?

880
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,220
Look. This is it.

881
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,500
I planned to buy it.

882
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,380
But I resigned impulsively
and lost my year-end bonus.

883
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,420
Yeah. This bag is pretty.

884
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,140
But it's way too expensive.

885
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,140
We make money to buy things, don't we?

886
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,300
The price isn't a concern.

887
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,860
It's perfect for you.

888
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,380

I get it. Rest assured.

906

We have the wrapper and the certificate.

907
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,540
Far better than those knockoffs.

908
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,380
How much is it?

(Su Zhizhou: How much is it?)

910
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,100
So expensive?

911

It's the lowest price.
