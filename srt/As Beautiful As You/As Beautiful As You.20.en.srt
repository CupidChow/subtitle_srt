=Episode 20=

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,430
I'm in love with a lady.

24
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,920
She has a beautiful name.

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,150
Li Li.

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,350
- Lili?
- Yes.

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,680
Sounds uncool.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,200
It's L-I, Li.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,350
It means "more beautiful than phoenix".

30
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,310
Just like her name,

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,120
she's gorgeous.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
I've never met a girl

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
as beautiful as her before.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,350
So, it's like I fell in love with her

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,710
at first sight

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
and then loved her deeper.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,710
Then pursue her.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
I did.

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,680
But she has a boyfriend.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,400
Even if she doesn't,

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm not her cup of tea.

42
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,430
She's dazzling

43
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,750
while I'm ordinary.

44
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,910
Look at me all over.

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,400
Nothing makes me good enough for her.

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
Bro,

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,680
let me be honest.

48
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,520
What makes a man attractive

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,910
is that he's loyal to himself.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,910
You should find out what makes you special.

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,560
Stand up and let me see.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Yeah.

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,470
You're handsome and fit.

54
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,360
But...

55
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,960
Why are you dressed like this?

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Do you think

57
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,150
I still stand a chance?

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
Yes.

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Yes, of course.

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,750
To be honest,

61
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm the owner of this bar.

62
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,630
I've seen a lot of men

63
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,680
just like you.

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,280
Then tell me.

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,520
How should I be dressed

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,630
to make myself

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
look charming?

68
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,560
OK. For the sake we get acquainted,

69
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,150
let me give you a new look.

70
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
OK.

71
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,550
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,520
I'll write it down.

73
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,700
(Su Zhizhou, Xingchen Technology)

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,470
You're from Xingchen Technology?

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,800
You know our company?

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,960
Yes. I'm quite familiar.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Your investor

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,680
is my nephew.

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,150
Your boss Ji Xing

80
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,470
and her best friends.

81
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
Tu Xiaomeng and Li Li...

82
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,680
We're very familiar.

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,840
That's right.

84
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,470
Wait.

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,590
Is Li Li you just mentioned...?

86
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,600
Shh.

87
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,870
Keep it to yourself.

88
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't tell anyone else.

89
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,470
- Fine.
- I beg you.

90
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,710
I know. I get this a lot.

91
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll keep it secret for you.

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,470
Fine. Don't bother to write it down.

93
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,310
Come with me.

94
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,870
Where are we going?

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
How on earth

96
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,960
did you get

97
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,360
this ordinary programmer style

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,480
from all these fancy clothes?

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,270
Programmer style?

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,190
It feels comfortable, I think.

101
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
The root of all evil

102
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,680
is being ordinary.

103
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,160
How can you be

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
the most handsome guy?

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
Forget it. I'll pick an outfit for you.

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Weird.

107
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,000
Really weird.

108
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,870
Put on your suit.

109
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,470
Spin around.

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Twitch your mouth.

111
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,120
Why do you look

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
like a funny comedian?

113
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
Oh, I know.

114
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,310
Your appearance decides
how fashionable you look.

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Don't be discouraged.

116
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,120
You aren't as handsome as me.

117
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,510
But you're above the average.

118
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,480
How about we stop?

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,830
I don't think I'm a fashion type.

120
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,270
My fashionable outfits

121
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,390
would never fail.

122
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,070
There must be a perfect outfit for you.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,950
Attractive, young, and fashionable...

124
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,590
Oh, yes.

125
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,710
Morning.

126
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,030
Bonjour.

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Morning.

128
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,390
Who did that?

129
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,230
Me.

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Mr. Su.

131
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,920
You look quite...

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,440
Bright.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Thanks.

134
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,070
Our department will have a meeting.

135
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,680
The Purchasing Department should attend it.

136
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,870
Inform them.

137
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,910
OK.

138
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,230
Miss Li.

139
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
Anything urgent?

140
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,560
No.

141
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,950
If you're busy, get to your work.

142
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,270
I'm going out for a moment.

143
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,750
Your outfit is...

144
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,830
Extraordinary.

145
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,790
Xia.

146
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,070
Ask Miss Ji to sign this.

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,030
OK.

148
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
Extraordinary?

149
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,630
Is it a compliment

150
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,120
or is it sarcasm?

151
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,800
Li made a very clear point.

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,720
You look good.

153
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,000
But never dress like this again.

154
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
I told him I wasn't the wild type.

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,600
You're on vacation?

156
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,750
I have a day off. So, I'm here to see you.

157
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,800
See me?

158
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,800
But you didn't visit me

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,160
when you had days off before.

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
Oh, I see.

161
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,510
You took all the trouble

162
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,070
to recommend Shao Yichen to me.

163
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,070
He's a handsome talent, indeed.

164
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,920
No wonder my niece did so much for him.

165
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,480
Don't make fun of me, uncle.

166
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,000
I only recommended him.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He wouldn't be hired

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
until he was screened

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
by your hospital.

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,430
And remember.

171
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,870
Don't tell Yichen about this.

172
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,920
Or he'll feel sick about it.

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,950
Is he very busy today?

174
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,600
Why do I not see him?

175
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,360
He's been busy

176
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,270
with the clinical test

177
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,720
on 3D medical printing

178
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,630
I started with Xingchen Technology.

179
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
He's in the Innovation Center, I think.

180
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,640
Why don't you just call him?

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,960
OK.

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,960
Mr. Han.

183
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,240
This is the volunteer's recovery report.

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,040
The volunteer has started

185
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,510
basic rehabilitation exercises.

186
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,240
The intervertebral cage and his bones

187
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,510
fuse very well, too.

188
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,870
What have you been up to lately?

189
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
Yes. A tricky question.

190
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
Think carefully before you reply.

191
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Can you give me something

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,240
for reference?

193
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,510
No.

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,240
Recently,

195
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,360
I've left some small things

196
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
to my subordinates.

197
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,000
I signed up

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
for an inspection trip to Germany.

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,750
I want to study further

200
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,670
and quickly figure out

201
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,150
Xingchen's product positioning.

202
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,600
A barely good answer.

203
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,720
Boss, the meeting is coming up.

204
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,550
Don't limit yourself.

205
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,510
Think outside the box.

206
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,870
What do you mean?

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,800
Think for yourself.

208
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
Oh, Miss Ji, I guess you forgot

209
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,750
something very important.

210
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,680
What is it?

211
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,750
Regularly tell me

212
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,790
how Dahuang is doing.

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,960
Dahuang.

214
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,510
Pretty cat.

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
(Han Ting)
It looks thinner.

216
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,510
Feed it more tinned food.

217
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,360
OK, boss.

218
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,180
(Ji Xing)

219
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
You've been back for only a few days

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,390
and you're going out again?

221
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,080
Here. Have some juice.

222
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

223
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,390
I'm going to Germany.

224
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,360
Germany?

225
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a far and strange country.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,870
Why are you going there?

227
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,080
I'm going there

228
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
to learn something

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,590
from excellent old manufacturers

230
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,720
of medical devices

231
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
and broaden my horizons.

232
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,120
OK. I support you in your career.

233
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
We should work hard.

234
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,120
Unless we die...

235
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,510
We should always learn.

236
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,560
- Come on.
- Come on.

237
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,910
So cliche.

238
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,670
Dahuang,

239
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,920
cheer up for Mom, OK?

240
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,960
Oh, my cat.

241
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,790
It lies here so comfortably.

242
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,550
I was taking photos of it just now.

243
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,670
Good cat.

244
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,550
It's asleep.

245
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Qiuzi, come on in.

246
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,320
Yichen,

247
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,200
congrats on working at Xinggang Hospital.

248
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,280
Thank you.

249
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,630
I'm making soup. Have a seat.

250
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,470
OK.

251
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,720
Yichen,

252
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,150
you're done cooking?

253
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,000
I had meant to cook for you

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,910
for celebration.

255
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,360
You're my guest.

256
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,360
And you did me such a big favor.

257
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
How can I let you cook?

258
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
Qiuzi,

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,200
you were taking care of me

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,150
so that I had time

261
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,390
to prepare for the interview.

262
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,080
And the reference materials you gave me

263
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,480
really helped a lot.

264
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,350
Thank you.

265
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,870
You're always excellent.

266
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,550
Even without my help,
you would be admitted, too.

267
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,360
I brought you some wine. Taste it.

268
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,670
Oh, plum wine.

269
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,080
Yes. I tasted some and found it good.

270
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,440
So, I brought you one bottle.

271
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,870
What? How does it taste?

272
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,800
I haven't tasted it.

273
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
We'll drink together.

274
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,110
Taste it now.

275
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,320
OK.

276
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,840
Tastes good.

277
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,550
I knew you would like it.

278
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,080
Looks like you have

279
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,270
a similar taste to mine.

280
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,320
You made me my favorite dish,

281
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,160
Kung Pao chicken.

282
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,080
Taste it.

283
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,390
How does it taste?

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
Delicious.

285
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,750
Thanks.

286
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,670
Drink it.

287
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,510
Li, recently,

288
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,320
you've been glowing with romance.

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
You must be in sweet love.

290
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,350
I have?

291
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,200
This boyfriend seems different.

292
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,240
But considering how fast

293
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,870
Li has a new boyfriend,

294
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,550
I wonder when they'll break up.

295
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,360
This one is kind of different.

296
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,200
He's my cup of tea.

297
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,720
I really don't want to break up with him.

298
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,080
So, you're serious.

299
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,200
When will you have us meet him?

300
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,600
Not until Xing is back from Germany.

301
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,510
You guys can also

302
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,480
check him for me,

303
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
Ji Xing.

304
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,160
No problem.

305
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,200
Have you packed the euro cash

306
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
exchanged from the bank?

307
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,990
Yes.

308
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,000
It's here.

309
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,200
These days, I'll leave Xingchen

310
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
to you and Su Zhizhou.

311
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,600
If anything happens,

312
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,790
you can call me,

313
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,120
regardless of the jet lag.

314
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,150
And Tu Xiaomeng.

315
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,670
Dahuang is naughty.

316
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,600
If it disobeys you, deduct its cat food.

317
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,600
Don't worry.

318
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,630
Leave Dahuang to me.

319
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,150
I'll take good care of it.

320
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,200
Well, Xing,

321
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,720
if you have time, can you

322
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
buy me some skincare products

323
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,910
from the duty-free shop?

324
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,390
I'll send you the list later.

325
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,390
No problem.

326
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,870
Send me the photos.

327
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,790
Thanks.

328
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,230
Xing,

329
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
when you're there alone,

330
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,910
you have to stay safe.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,150
If anything happens,

332
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,360
tell us in the group chat.

333
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,750
I will.

334
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,120
Come and press the suitcase for me.

335
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,150
Like this.

336
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,510
I'll go help her.

337
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,870
- Have you packed your passport?
- Yes.

338
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,840
ID card.

339
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,390
You should carry it with you.

340
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,870
Why do you keep it here?

341
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,720
Why?

342
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,000
The shoes...

343
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
Don't press it now. Wait.

344
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
Put the shoes here,

345
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,870
or they would be broken.

346
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,790
- Don't put them here.
- High-heeled shoes.

347
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,600
I insist on putting them here.

348
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,150
- I have some. Don't go.
- Where?

349
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll put it here.

350
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,510
Hello, sweethearts.

351
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,080
I was so busy with my best friends

352
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,200
that I started late today.

353
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,870
You can't wait, can you?

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,270
Thank you.

355
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,390
Thank you for your gifts.

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,910
Today,

357
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,910
what do you want me to do,

358
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,910
to sing or talk with you?

359
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,790
Today, Smart Lemon looks

360
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,960
really smart.

361
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,750
(Lu Linjia)

362
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,320
You know I'm doing live streaming.

363
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,840
How dare you disturb me?

364
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,420
(Smart Lemon)

365
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,600
Long time no see.

366
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm here to give you some money.

367
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,120
Your live streaming in my bar

368
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,200
worked very well.

369
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,440
Many visitors claimed to be your fans.

370
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,790
It's your KPI.

371
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,080
The email has been sent

372
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,960
for fee confirmation.

373
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,080
Read it when it's over.

374
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,790
After you confirm it, I'll pay.

375
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,720
(Smart Lemon)
In this case,

376
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,870
I'm no longer sleepy.

377
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,320
I'll confirm it now.

378
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,790
Today, I'm in such a good mood.

379
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,360
What about you, guys?

380
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,360
How about

381
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
I sing a happy song?

382
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,590
Miss Ji.

383
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,510
Mr. Han?

384

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
I can hardly see you lately.

573
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,200
I'll make it up to you tonight.

574
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,960
Is your fridge that big?

575
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,400
I'll get them for my friends.

576
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,080
This one is for you.

577
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,440
But I don't drink.

578
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,790
That's why I give it to you.

579
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,720
When I drink next time,

580
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,160
you can clink it with me.

581
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,510
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

582
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,720
How will you go this afternoon?

583
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,510
A car will be sent.

584
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,550
On this scout trip, pay more attention.

585
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,720
Learn from good experience

586
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,400
and take warnings from bad examples.

587
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,510
This is so adorable.

588
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,910
OK.

589
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,440
Excuse me.

590
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,480
This one.

591
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,920
How long have I been here?

592
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,240
For six days.

593
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Shall I cancel

594
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,550
tomorrow's schedules for you?

595
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
(Ji Xing)
Are you available today?

596
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,680
I'll see you in the hotel canteen
in ten minutes.

597
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,980
(Han Ting)

598
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:57,870
Mr. Han.

599
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,920
What have you got?

600
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,440
I think every enterprise

601
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,790
makes me think

602
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,440
and introspect.

603
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
For example?

604
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,720
Hello. What would you like?

605
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,760
Water.

606
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
You said Deman,

607
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,200
Bivar, and AJ Tech are good companies.

608
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,030
I focused on these three companies.

609
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,400
I think their handlers

610
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,750
are very humble.

611
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,590
They give me a feeling

612
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,830
that they're really steady.

613
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,960
Here's your water.

614
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,440
Then I realize

615
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
some companies succeed for a reason.

616
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,200
And what you said at Shenzhen Summit...

617
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,960
"Start with small businesses
and seize the chance.

618
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,960
Conform to the market and seek for demands."

619
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,200
So, you came to Germany

620
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,310
to verify what I said.

621
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,440
No, I just...

622
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,030
After I experienced it personally,

623
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,440
I could truly feel it.

624
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,790
What about other companies?

625
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,510
I also visited Tabea and Seme.

626
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,200
They're a little bit boastful.

627
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
The bosses and the employees

628
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,550
kept talking about dreams.

629
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,110
But when asked about detailed businesses,

630
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,550
they couldn't say anything.

631
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,550
So, it's a very important thing

632
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,270
to follow an excellent leader

633
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,270
and learn from good companies.

634
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,920
Tell me. What do you want?

635
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,310
I'm going back to China the day after tomorrow.

636
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
Before that,

637
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,550
may I visit

638
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,440
Dongyang Base?

639
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,110
At two tomorrow afternoon,

640
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,200
see you in front of the hotel.

641
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,350
That's great. You approved.

642
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,510
Have you had lunch?

643
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,590
No.

644
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,030
The treat is on me.

645
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,000
Nice language.

646
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Here's the menu.

647
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,030
(Dongyang Group)

648
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,870
Dongyang Base

649
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,000
was established in October, 2017.

650
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,400
There was only one building.

651
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,200
Phase I covered nine acres.

652
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,440
So far, Phase II has been completed.

653
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,880
Twenty acres in total.

654
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,510
That is Phase III.

655
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,550
It's under construction.

656
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,030
What is that building for?

657
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,640
That's the R&amp;D center.

658
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,880
And the lab is over there.

659
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
Beside it is the production site.

660
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,790
Such a great place.

661
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,510
Welcome

662
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,440
to Dongyang Overseas R&amp;D Center.

663
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,830
Robot Huang is here for you.

664
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,350
Its name is Huang?

665
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,440
H-U-A-N-G.

666
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,270
Huang is a robot guide.

667
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,960
It will show us

668
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,550
around every exhibition hall.

669
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,110
Hello, Mr. Han.

670
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,000
- Hello.
- Follow me.

671
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,030
Please move forward with me.

672
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,960
Is its system

673
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,880
in Chinese?

674
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,070
By distinguishing

675
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,960
our appearances

676
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,310
and conversations,

677
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,400
it can tell we are Chinese.

678
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,540
In this exhibition hall

679
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,880
(Schematic of AI Medical)
are AI products

680
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,310
of Dongyang R&amp;D Base.

681
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,880
There are different sections
according to functions.

682
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,830
Please come along with me.

683
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,720
OK.

684
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,960
This wall of photos

685
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,590
records Dongyang's development in Munich.

686
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,620
(Unsuccessful Products)

687
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,710
Why are unsuccessful products

688
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,920
exhibited up there?

689
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,150
The glow of success fades away quickly.

690
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,630
But lessons from failure

691
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,510
urge us to move forward.

692
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,480
Then why were they

693
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,760
unsuccessful?

694
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
Technology bottlenecks.

695
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,590
Mainly the inaccurate analyses

696
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,630
about the market.

697
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,230
Actually, developing a new product

698
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,710
is like gambling.

699
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,440
Some people are just proficient
in principles and algorithms.

700
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,920
But no one can win all the time.

701
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,880
Dongyang is a big company

702
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,960
with great power.

703
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,320
It can tolerate errors.

704
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,400
Once a small company like us

705
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,960
makes a mistake, it may be destroyed.

706
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,670
I've been thinking

707
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,230
about Xingchen's product positioning.

708
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
I don't want to pick the wrong product.

709
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,320
I even studied all the products of Hanhai.

710
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,800
I thought about competing with them

711
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,550
but didn't want to be crushed.

712
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,760
It's good to be competitive.

713
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,710
But don't let your rival disturb you.

714
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,630
You should pick a product

715
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,960
based on your own conditions.

716
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,920
A company

717
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,000
can't be competitive

718
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,110
without a feature or a style.

719
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
There's even a basketball gym?

720
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,550
Yeah. I came here
every time I was stressed out.

721
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,150
When you were in Germany,

722
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,990
you were stressed out?

723
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,480
But later, I figured it out.

724
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,710
Stress would bring motivation.

725
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,320
I just need to get my mind right

726
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,230
and move past it.

727
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
Can you shoot?

728
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,390
Of course.

729
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,160
Let me teach you.

730
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,030

Sausage platter, tuna salad.

770
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,320
Beer bread.

771
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,950
Chicken nuggets.

772
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,550
That white beer

773
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,840
looks so good.

774
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,510
How about some more stout beer?

775
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,030
A glass of white beer

776
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,280
and a glass of stout beer.

777
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,920
OK. A moment, please.

778
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,670
You're a stranger here.

779
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
If you get drunk, no one will recognize you.

780
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,110
Why does it sound like I'm a drunkard?

781
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,710
I witnessed that.

782
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,550
You must be tired. Have more water.

783
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,960
Tastes great.

784
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,760
Come on, cheers.

785
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,110
Thanks for your care

786
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,150
these days.

787
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,280
You're welcome.

788
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,000
Doing sports really helps with stress.

789
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,710
Now, I have a lot of ideas.

790
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,630
I have a lot of concerns, too.

791
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,320
Regret starting a company?

792
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,640
No.

793
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,150
Don't stress yourself out.

794
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,240
Take your time.

795
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,510
I won't withdraw from Xingchen

796
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,920
just because you're slow.

797
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,070
Taste this salad.

798
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,440
It's super delicious.

799
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,470
Wait.

800
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,030
An investor cares most about the return,

801
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,320
doesn't he?

802
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,320
Do you actually

803
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,360
think less of Xingchen and me?

804
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,150
I don't mind if you're slow

805
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,030
because starting a company

806
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,110
is like living a life.

807
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,550
Everyone has his pace.

808
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,670
Don't bother to catch up with anyone

809
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,800
or any other company.

810
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,920
Make your own way.

811
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,230
One day, you will proposer.

812
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,760
You don't drink wine.

813
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,840
But you're so good at inspiring.

814
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,630
Slow down. Don't get drunk.

815
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,870
I won't.

816
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,070
When someone is happy,

817
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,230
he won't get drunk.

818
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,030
So, you're happy today?

819
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,800
The music here is so beautiful.

820
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,230
German sounds sexy.

821
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,000
Beautiful, indeed.

822
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,590
That's too bad you can't drink.

823
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,710
Be careful.

824
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,070
I'm OK.

825
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,110
Two glasses of beer won't get me drunk.

826
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,800
Good evening.

827
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,510
Oh, Han Ting.

828
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,590
When you were in Germany over the years,

829
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,630
did you have

830
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,760
a relationship with a girl?

831
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,840
Did you?

832
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,630
- No.
- Really?

833
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,630
Your appearance...

834
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,320
What?

835
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
In Germany, I had to learn German,

836
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,320
take classes,

837
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,110
and start up a business.

838
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,840
I was in no mood for love.

839
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,630
I didn't have a colorful life as you did.

840
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,360
You enjoyed work and love.

841
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,710
Why do I think you're satirizing me?

842
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,280
In your eyes,

843
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,320
do I only satirize you all the time?

844
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,640
Not really.

845
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,900
Then what do you think of me?
