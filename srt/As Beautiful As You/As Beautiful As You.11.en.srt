- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,720
I'll clean the cardigan
and give it back to you soon.

It's OK. Take your time.

I'll read your comments carefully.

You go get some rest early.

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
OK.

31
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,230
I should go.

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,760

I don't think this is what you look like.

It's the first time someone dares

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,150
to delete me on WeChat.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,870
Just you wait, Smart Lemon.

41
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,760
I'll let you know how it feels

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,960
to be deleted by me mercilessly.

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,550
Here. Have some fruit.

44
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,180
Why did you turn it off?

45
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,780
Why have you been so thin?

46
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,900
Have you worked too much?

47
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,100
I'm not thin. Look at my chubby face.

48
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,660
Don't laugh.

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,620
You're much thinner than last time I saw you.

50
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,420
You know what?

51
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,300
A mother's biggest wish

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,540
is to keep her child

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,220
happy and healthy.

54
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,180
It's OK to be ordinary,

55
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,620
but don't be worn out.

56
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,500
I'm doing great.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,140
I'm very happy.

58
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,060
How come I can't see that?

59
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,620
You can just fool your father.

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,100
Come on.

61
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,020
You've been emotional since little.

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,260
But in life,

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,820
we can't always get what we want.

64
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,700
Actually, I think it's good

65
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,140
when you make a fresh start.

66
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,820
The only thing that never changes

67
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,300
is the change itself.

68
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,940
Nothing is permanent.

69
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,340
I get it, Mom.

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,100
Think I'm nagging, huh?

71
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,180
Here's my point.

72
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,620
Look, at work

73
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,740
or in love,

74
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,100
what's gone is gone.

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,940
When you're at my age, you'll understand.

76
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,420
Throughout your life,

77
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,140
many people will pass by.

78
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,980
Some of them

79
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,100
can only have meals with you.

80
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,220
Some of them

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,700
can accompany you for several years.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,100
The one who'll accompany you for a lifetime...

83
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Maybe you'll meet him soon.

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,780
Yes, yes.

85
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,300
It's OK if I can't meet him.

86
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,100
Don't be silly, girl.

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,600
People get married.

88
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,700
You eat it.

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,700
The strawberries are so sweet. Eat more.

90
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
You just think I'm nagging.

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,340
You loved to watch the film

92
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,700
of the three siblings, right?

93
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,700
Let me find it for you.

94
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,740
I'm on it.

95
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,140
A boss like you must be busy.

96
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,060
Do you have time

97
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,180
to dine with your parents?

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,500
(Emergency Room)
The place of the accident was remote

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,180
with limited healthcare resources.

100
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,900
First-aid treatment wasn't available.

101
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,300
The patients lost too much blood.

102
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,020
There's not much else we can do.

103
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,540
Sorry for your loss.

104
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,980
(Affixes of German Words)

105
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Miss Smart Lemon,

106
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,380
we're an electric bike brand.

107
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,580
(Electric Bike Experience Store)
Are you interested

108
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,420
in advertising our brand?

109
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,780
Yes. What do you need me to do?

110
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,860
Come to our store anytime you want.

111
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,140
I'll send you the location.

112
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,180
You just need to advertise
in your live streaming.

113
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,700
(Electric Bike Experience Store,
Xingyuntai Road)

114
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,180
OK. I'll be there tomorrow.

115
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
How time flies!

116
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,900
Yeah.

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
Throughout the year,

118
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,900
how many times have I seen you?

119
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,700
When you had a job,

120
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,340
you didn't have much free time.

121
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,980
Now, you have a company and you're even busier.

122
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,340
Then think like this.
If your daughter's dream comes true,

123
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,020
you can tell your neighbors

124
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,140
that your daughter is awesome.

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,140
Just like how you bragged

126
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
when I was the first place at school.

127
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,540
I don't care if you can succeed.

128
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
I hope you'll finish work soon

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,820
and go home for the Spring Festival.

130
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,420
I will.

131
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,740
There's nothing new

132
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,100
with the Spring Festival.

133
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,540
But only when

134
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,020
the whole family stays together

135
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,940
and celebrate it excitedly

136
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,580
would it be the real festival, right?

137
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,580
I'll go home and stick to you.

138
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,100
Don't get bored of me

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
every few days.

140
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,820
Your father and I

141
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,140
have totally spoiled you.

142
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,740
You know what?

143
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,140
You're not what you used to be.

144
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
You're a boss.

145
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Learn from Han.

146
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,380
- OK.
- Be steadier.

147
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,300
I will.

148
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,900
Look how independent Han is.

149
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,380
He's more mature than his age.

150
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,780
He must have

151
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,100
suffered a lot.

152
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Speaking of this,

153
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,180
the moment I saw him,

154
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,300
I felt familiar with him.

155
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,780
Say goodbye to him for me.

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,220
Ask him to take care of himself.

157
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,180
When he has time,

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,900
invite him to our home.

159
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,980
I'll always welcome him.

160
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,500
OK. I'll bring your regard.

161
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,460
You care quite a lot about him.

162
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,340
I care more about you.

163
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,660
(Niu Electric Bikes)

164
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,460
Hello.

165
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,700
I...

166
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,100
Lu Linjia?

167
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,820
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,980
Advertisement day, huh?

169
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,020
Come on.

170
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,100
You're the advertiser?

171
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,220
I own a wide range of businesses.

172
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,780
Come on.

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,900
Add me on WeChat.

174
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,020
Now, text me your phone number.

175
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,100
I'll contact you when there's a job.

176
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,540
Hurry.

177
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,540
(Friend Confirmation)

178
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,540
You added me and then deleted me.

179
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,420
What do you mean?

180
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,100
To let you know how it feels to be deleted.

181
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,180
Are you just too bored?

182
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah. I'm too bored.

183
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,900
Are you insane?

184
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,900
I am insane.

185
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,940
What a weirdo!

186
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,180
Listen up, Lu Linjia.

187
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,140
Never dream of adding me

188
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,100
on WeChat again.

189
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Discard the advertisement?

190
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,900
Lu Linjia, what on earth do you want?

191
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,020
There you are, Mr. Lu.

192
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,860
Hi, Mr. Liu.

193
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,300
Let me introduce her.

194
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,780
This is a very famous

195
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,860
Internet celebrity.

196
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,900
Smart Lemon.

197
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,700
You'll take care of the rest.

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,340
Count on me.

199
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,380
I should go.

200
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,020
Smart Lemon, let's get in and prepare.

201
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,900
When you buy one now, you may possibly

202
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,220
get lavish presents.

203
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,420
OK, sweethearts.

204
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,420
That's all

205
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,980
for my live streaming

206
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,940
in the electric bike store.

207
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,380
Thanks for your support.

208
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,620
Bye-bye.

209
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Thanks for your hard work.

210
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,740
Thank you very much.

211
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,100
Mr. Lu kept recommending you

212
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,380
for your high real-time interaction rate.

213
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,500
I watched it and he was right.

214
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,820
Thanks for your hard work.

215
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,540
This electric bike is for you.

216
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,380
For me?

217
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,700
Thank you.

218
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,100
- Thank you so much.
- You deserve it.

219
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,140
If there's another chance,

220
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,980
let's cooperate again.

221
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,740
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

222
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,620
It's not that I don't want to thank you.

223
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,620
But anyway,

224
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,220
you deleted me.

225
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,100
OK, Boss.

226
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,380
I'm downstairs.

227
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,900
- OK.
- Assistant Tang.

228
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,620
Miss Ji?

229
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,420
Hi, Assistant Tang.

230
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,700
Well, I have something

231
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,740
to consult you.

232
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,220
- But I'm going to...
- Let her finish.

233
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,340
Go ahead, please.

234
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,860
Can we

235
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,020
buy a 3D printer

236
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,540
through Dongyang's channel?

237
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,460
The number of high-density printers

238
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,940
is way too small.

239
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,220
A small company like us has to

240
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,060
line up for a long time to get one.

241
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,300
Let her continue.

242
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,740
Here's the thing.

243
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,300
I'm done reading

244
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,170
Mr. Han's comments.

245
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,860
I made a new work plan.

246
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,460
Now, Xingchen has

247
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,380
three priorities.

248
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,380
To expand our team,

249
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,260
get a lab,

250
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,540
and buy a 3D printer.

251
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,940
The Spring Festival is coming.

252
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,180
I plan to recruit employees
and get a lab after that.

253
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,380
But the printer thing

254
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,060
must be solved before that.

255
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,620
Then...

256
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Ask her what she wants.

257
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,380
So, what do you want from me?

258
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,780
Is it convenient for you

259
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,740
to make a group chat of the suppliers and me

260
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,220
for communication?

261
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,260
What about Boss?

262
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,740
We don't need

263
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,460
to tell Mr. Han now.

264
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,980
Put me on speaker.

265
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,780
- OK.
- OK?

266
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,660
Thank you. It's so nice of you.

267
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,580
Thank you so much.

268
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,420
(Mr. Han)

269
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,380
Then...

270
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,820
(Mr. Han)

271
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,860
Come to my office.

272
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,220
Let's go.

273
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,220
Why did you not come to me for a request?

274
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
I didn't want to bother you

275
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,540
for something so small.

276
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,540
Instead of taking a shortcut,

277
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,460
you chose to do it the hard way.

278
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,860
Can I?

279
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,060
Are you saying

280
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,820
I can buy a 3D printer

281
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,740
through Dongyang's channel?

282
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,180
It depends on whether you approve.

283
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,380
Another 5% of the stock.

284
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,900
I'll find a way out myself,

285
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,740
Mr. Han.

286
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,620
I'll let you work. I should go.

287
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,780
Li Li, help.

288
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,740
Is there any way

289
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,340
we can buy a 3D printer soon?

290
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,060
I'll see what I can do.

291
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,300
Queen Li Li,

292
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,140
you're awesome!

293
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,030
(Sales Director Li Li
breaks her client's family as a mistress.)

294
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,220
(To maintain connections,
she has a long affair with her client.)

295
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,620
Emergency?

296
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,140
Dining with you is always the priority.

297
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,700
If something bothers you,

298
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,340
I can take care of it.

299
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,100
If someone curses me,

300
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,460
Mr. Xiao, will you curse him in turn?

301
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,740
Who's so daring?

302
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,740
How dare he curse you?

303
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,140
Someone unimportant.

304
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,420
Never mind.

305
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,260
For such a little problem,

306
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,620
I don't need your help, Mr. Xiao.

307
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,420
Our current relationship is comfortable.

308
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,180
It's pure, too.

309
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,060
I don't want to sabotage it.

310
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,140
Once something else is involved

311
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
and we rely on each other,

312
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,740
it will be hard

313
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,660
to get out of it.

314
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,460
Whatever you say.

315
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,660
I'm back.

316
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,180
Xing, you're back from work so early.

317
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,460
What happened to you?

318
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,620
You're so energetic.

319
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,700
You know what?

320
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,300
I've got a bike.

321
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,780
An electric bike.

322
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,620
I've got a plan.

323
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
I'll buy you a helmet

324
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
and take you for a ride.

325
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,060
OK.

326
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,300
Why did you buy an electric bike?

327
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,220
I didn't buy it.

328
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,780
It's because of Lu Linjia.

329
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,660
He got me a job.

330
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,260
He isn't very smart

331
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
or very reliable.

332
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,300
However,

333
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,820
I got an electric bike for his sake.

334
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,780
I'll stop complaining about him for now.

335
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,860
Do you think I've been lucky in money?

336
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,420
Tomorrow, I'm going to expand

337
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,180
the new territory of my career.

338
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,820
New territory?

339
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,340
What are you going to do?

340
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,580
I'll do a part-time job

341
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,780
to make some extra money

342
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,380
in the music store my friend just opened.

343
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,740
Meanwhile, I can sell my vocal lessons

344
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,220
to those instrument purchasers.

345
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,660
This is target advertising.

346
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,340
Kill two birds with one stone.

347
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,740
Awesome. Come on. I support you.

348
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,540
Xing,

349
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,660
have you heard

350
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,940
about this?

351
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,860
"Instead of supporting,

352
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,180
you'd better buy me a yacht."

353
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,140
Oh, you poor spirit. Don't expect a yacht.

354
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,580
I'll buy you a feast of pancakes.

355
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,700
I'll order it right away.

356
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,820
Pancakes, huh?

357
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,660
Don't make them spicy.

358
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,020
Oh, no. Excessive calories.

359
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,060
I'll do more strength training.

Would you like to try it?

373
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm not here to buy a piano.

374
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
I can't play the piano.

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,580
You flatter me, madam.

378
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,620
Everybody starts

379
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
from scratch.

380
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,740
In my opinion,

381
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,500
the beauty of music

382
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,620
actually lies in...

383
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,540
Even if there are cultural differences,

384
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,980
as long as the music begins,

385
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,780
the whole world can communicate.

386
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,620
That's sweet of you to say so.

387
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,340
Are you a student

388
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,180
from nearby Xinggang Conservatory of Music?

389
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,180
Yes. I was from that school.

390
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,820
But I've graduated.

391
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
I do a part-time job here.

392
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Part-time job?

393
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,380
Yes, madam.

394
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,980
If you have a kid

395
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,420
who wants to learn music,

396
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,660
come to me at any time.

397
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,020
I can give door-to-door lessons.

398
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,060
You'll have a discount.

399
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,900
Really?

400
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,060
That's great. Music brings us together.

401
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,940
I'm looking for a music teacher.

402
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,780
You are?

403
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,060
Then how old

404
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,140
is the child?

405
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,220
What level is he at?

406
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,740
Or when is convenient for you?

407
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,060
I can go meet him.

408
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,460
The kid is actually

409
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,740
50 years old.

410
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,260
That's me.

411
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,540
But I'm zero-based.

412
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,780
I can't play anything.

413
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,900
Do you teach adults?

414
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,220
Yes.

415
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,820
Sorry to have bothered you, Mr. Liu.

416
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,660
Bye.

417
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,620
(Sales Director Li Li
breaks her client's family as a mistress.)

418
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,420
This is outrageous!

419
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,500
What?

420
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,180
Mr. Wu, who harassed Li

421
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,660
is divorcing his wife.

422
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,540
His wife threw mud at Li online,

423
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
posted her photos,

424
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,810
and said she was a mistress.

425
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,340
Check it.

426
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,540
It happened a long time ago.

427
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,220
Why is she still tangling?

428
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,660
(A mistress! Shame on her!)

429
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,580
Who could bear such comments?

430
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Xing, shall I write a little app

431
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,180
to curse in return?

432
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,780
Not now.

433
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,780
Let me call her first.

434
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Queen Li Li, what are you doing?

435
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,340
I was about to call you.

436
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,580
I've found a supplier.

437
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,820
Tomorrow morning, we'll visit their factory.

438
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,340
This is great. You're awesome, indeed.

439
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,100
Umm...

440
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,620
Are you aware of the posts?

441
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,660
I am.

442
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,180
It's no big deal.

443
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,220
Some ignorant netizens

444
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,300
just curse me.

445
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
It doesn't disturb me in dining,

446
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,740
dressing, or dating.

447
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,300
I don't care what they say.

448
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,940
All right. I'll hang up, sweetheart.

449
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,620
So cool, Li.

450
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,940
OK. I'll be relieved, then.

451
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,660
Tomorrow, shall we go together?

452
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,140
OK.

453
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,180
Deal. Bye-bye.

454
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,460
Li Li is fine.

455
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,420
You focus on your work.

456
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,100
Xing.

457
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,540
Think about it.

458
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,660
Li

459
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,340
lost her job

460
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
because of us.

461
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,140
Shall we invite her

462
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,460
to join us?

463
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,740
Just be clear,

464
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,860
I really think

465
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,540
she's very capable at work.

466
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,620
I thought about it.

467
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,740
But I fear our company

468
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,580
would be too small for her.

469
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,660
How could it be?

470
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,500
Xing,

471
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,780
we get support

472
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,020
from Dongyang Medical.

473
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,540
We're a big company.

474
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,020
I'll think it over.

475
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,540
You get to work.

476
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,740
OK.

477
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,260
Come on. Look.

478
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,140
Over here, we have SLM800.

479
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,380
Totally 25 sets.

480
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,580
The rest sets are SLM600.

481
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,260
These are our products

482
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
to be delivered worldwide

483
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,580
within a month.

484
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,860
Oh, Miss Ji. How many sets do you want?

485
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,820
We need only one set.

486
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,860
One?

487
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Then I'll submit it for you.

488
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,980
Taking manufacture and shipping into account,

489
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,140
it can be delivered in six months.

490
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,060
- So long?
- Such a long time?

491
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,580
We're in urgent need of it.

492
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,500
Is there a better way

493
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,420
to get one sooner?

494
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,220
Look, you have so many sets in stock.

495
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,980
Can you give us one of them?

496
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,940
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,300
These are booked by other clients

498
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,260
in advance.

499
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,540
They're urging us, too.

500
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,380
The delivery time is too long.

501
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,420
Can we negotiate on the price?

502
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,860
Miss Li,

503
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,260
you want only one set.

504
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,300
We're already offering

505
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,180
a purchase price.

506
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,540
If I give you a discount,

507
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,580
money will be deducted

508
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,740
from my pay.

509
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,820
Our company is

510
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,140
in the pilot stage.

511
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,260
But it develops

512
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,420
very fast.

513
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
When our products

514
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,820
are massively produced,

515
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,540
we'll buy more printers.

516
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
I'm just sticking

517
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,540
to our company rules.

518
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,620
In terms of price,

519
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,820
I can't help more.

520
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,220
Please understand.

521
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,980
- We'll leave to it, then.
- Thanks.

522
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,300
- Thanks for today.
- Come this way.

523
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,740
You've arrived, Mr. Chang.

524
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,780
You seldom ask to see me.

525
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,340
I should come early.

526
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,540
Recently, I've been busy

527
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,220
with the Robot Bay thing.

528
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,060
At such a crucial time,

529
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,980
I've been really busy.

530
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,060
The promotion in primary hospitals, huh?

531
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,540
This circle is small, you know.

532
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,740
Have you been exhausted?

533
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,340
You look really haggard.

534
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,460
Just get to the point.

535
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,820
In previous projects, we used

536
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,660
to cooperate with big hospitals.

537
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,940
Robot Bay, however,

538
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,140
needs some resources of primary hospitals.

539
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,060
I don't have enough reserves.

540
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,660
How about you introduce some to me?

541
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,060
Not a problem.

542
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,460
Dongyang Medical is combining

543
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,980
software with hardware, right?

544
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,620
My company needs a transition, too.

545
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,940
Our medical devices

546
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,140
take a large proportion
in second and third-tier cities.

547
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,660
Our companies complement each other.

548
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,700
How about

549
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,180
we sign an official strategic agreement

550
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,540
for cooperation?

551
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,740
OK.

552
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,380
But after all, my company

553
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,820
is invested by Dongyang Medical.

554
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,220
Yours is the strongest rival

555
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,580
of Dongyang Medical.

556
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,860
How do you think

557
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,140
we can have a close cooperation?

558
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,580
Umm...

559
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,820
Will we fear nothing?

560
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,020
Before Han Ting came back,

561
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
we had been getting along nicely.

562
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,860
I shared with you

563
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,460
all my resources.

564
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,740
When Han Ting is back,

565
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,660
why are you being so aloof?

566
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,940
What are you talking about?

567
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,420
If I meant to be aloof,

568
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,140
I wouldn't have invited you here.

569
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,860
Miss Ji, you're young

570
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,820
but you start a company with all your money.

571
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
Great courage.

572
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
When your company

573
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,620
needs printers for massive production,

574
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,060
we'll prioritize that.

575
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,420
But this time, we can't help.

576
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,820
I get it.

577
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,420
Li Li,

578
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,420
let's go back to Dongyang and tell Boss.

579
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,740
One would be too little.

580
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,180
Beidi can't sell it to us.

581
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,380
Let's go back, then.

582
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,420
OK.

583
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Thanks for today.

584
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,460
We should go.

585
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,380
You just mentioned Dongyang.

586
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,220
Which company do you mean?

587
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,220
There's only one Dongyang in China.

588
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,820
Our investor is from Dongyang.

589
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,620
May I ask who he is?

590
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,220
Han Ting.

591
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,460
Oh, of course.

592
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,500
Xingchen Technology

593
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,860
has a bright prospect.

594
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,220
Please sit here for a while.

595
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,100
My boss Mr. Lin

596
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,460
is out for some business.

597
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,060
I'll call him and tell him about it.

598
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,180
- OK.
- Please be seated.

599
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,420
- OK.
- Thank you.

600
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,620
(Beidi Technology)

601
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,780
Smart move.

602
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,740
He's so snobbish.

603
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,980
Salespersons judge people, don't they?

604
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,820
You didn't lie, anyway.

605
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,780
Han Ting's name is really useful.

606
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
So it is.

607
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,420
(Mr. Wu)
Sorry, Miss Li.

608
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,160
I've deleted all the posts.

609
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
Mr. Wu texted me

610
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,780
and apologized.

611
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
He awakened?

612
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,860
That's impossible.

613
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,420
Someone must have helped behind my back.

614
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,380
When are you coming to my place?

615
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,220
(Li Li)

616
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,980
Do you know what I like you most about?

617
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,460
Your strong sense of purpose.

618
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,580
But sometimes,

619
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,820
when you're anxious,

620
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,740
you appear to be utilitarian.

621
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,580
Burning bridges really upsets me.

622
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,740
And when one is angry,

623
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,140
he'll easily lose his mind.

624
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,260
Oh, Mr. Chang.

625
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,460
Get angry with me

626
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,780
or instruct me as you wish.

627
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,340
But it's hard for a woman like me

628
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,540
to do business.

629
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
Don't be fussy about me.

630
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,580
Don't always scare me.

631
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,740
Your tea tastes better, indeed.

632
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,540
I could tell a long time ago.

633
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,460
You're pretty obsessed

634
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,580
with Han Ting.

635
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,540
Have you thought

636
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,180
about whether he cares about you?

637
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,620
Whether he cares about me,

638
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,740
he's the biggest investor

639
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,140
of my company.

640
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,940
Who else

641
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,180
should I be obsessed with?

642
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,540
(Mr. Lin of Beidi)

643
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,260
Hello, Mr. Lin.

644
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,460
Miss Zeng,

645
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,780
do you know

646
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,260
Ji Xing from Xingchen Technology?

647
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,700
Ji Xing?

648
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,940
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Have some water.

649
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,180
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

650
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,380
According to Mr. Lin,

651
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,700
we can give you one printer

652
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,180
out of someone else's order.

653
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,980
Thank you so much.

654
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,100
What about the delivery time?

655
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,140
Here's the thing.

656
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,540
The Spring Festival is coming.

657
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,380
After the festival,

658
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,140
we'll prioritize your delivery.

659
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,820
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

660
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Shall we talk about
the details of the contract?

661
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
OK.

662
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,780
Excuse me.

663
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,260
You talk to Miss Li.

664
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,100
I have to take this.

665
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,220
OK.

666
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,580
In terms of price,

667
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,660
can we have

668
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,060
a 5% off?

669
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,380
Here's the thing, Miss Li.

670
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,700
Getting one set

671
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,980
out of someone else's order

672
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,140
is already the best we can do.

673
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,020
And you want only one set.

674
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,420
In terms of price,

675
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,020
we can't do anything else.

676
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,540
There is no precedent, either.

677
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,020
Don't worry.

678
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,660
Xingchen isn't a team of amateurs.

679
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,860
We'll have plenty of cooperation

680
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,180
with your company.

681
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,540
The profit margin

682
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,940
will be more than 5%.

683
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,260
Miss Ji

684
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,940
was Mr. Han's schoolmate in college.

685
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,460
And Mr. Han thinks

686
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,860
highly of her.

687
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,740
Hearing about her business,

688
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,540
Mr. Han was the first to invest.

689
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,580
Don't tell anyone else.

690
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,980
Miss Ji and Mr. Han

691
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,180
both keep a low profile,

692
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,060
expecting no one to pay much attention.

693
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,020
I get it.

694
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,420
Miss Ji's idea

695
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,300
is in sync with that of Mr. Han

696
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,940
in this industry.

697
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,100
That's why he invested in Xingchen.

698
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,740
Mr. Han has such a good eye.

699
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,460
Mr. Lin and I

700
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,900
also admire your courage

701
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,020
and execution, Miss Ji.

702
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,300
How about this?

703
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,620
I'll venture to make a decision.

704
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,900
In this cooperation,

705
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,860
I'll make the price 5% off.

706
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,100
We can make friends.

707
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,940
What do you say?

708
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Thank you.

709
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Thank you so much.

710
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,540
Oh, Mr. Lin just called,

711
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,300
inviting you to lunch tomorrow.

712
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,660
I wonder if you...

713
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,100
- OK.
- We'd love to.

714
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,900
But it should be our treat.

715
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,980
I'll text you when the canteen is reserved.

716
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,820
OK.

717
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,980
Mr. Lin just said

718
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,460
he was stuck in traffic

719
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
and would be late.

720
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,220
(Han Ting)
How's it going with the printer?

721
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,420
If you still can't buy one,

722
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,540
the offer for 5% of the stock

723
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,460
is still valid.

724
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,420
(Ji Xing)
Mr. Han,

725
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,300
the printer is successfully ordered.

726
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,180
I'm sorry,

727
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,140
but we'll keep

728
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,700
5% of the stock to ourselves.

729
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,380
How did you order one?

730
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,300
(Han Ting: How did you order one?)

731
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,820
(Ji Xing)
It's a trade secret.

732
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,540
(Zeng Di)

733
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,300
Hello.

734
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,620
Are you available later

735
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,540
and shall we have lunch?

736
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,500
I have something

737
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
to tell you face to face.

738
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,780
OK.

739
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,940
I really had no idea.

740
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,620
(Stay Always Safe)
A freelancer like you

741
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,860
also has to work so hard.

742
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,740
It consumes your throat and mental effort.

743
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,140
Especially Poison Apple...

744
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,420
She's terrible.

745
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,660
Look.

746
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,220
This...

747
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,980
It doesn't look good here, right?

748
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,060
Give me... Give me a white one.

749
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,580
- This?
- Right.

750
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,980
Oh, I can't do anything about it.

751
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,860
Mr. Lu backs her up.

752
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,780
Poison Apple and Mr. Lu

753
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,660
are really birds of a feather.

754
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,460
They stand my way

755
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,300
and they're jinxes.

756
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,540
If Mr. Lu

757
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,300
annoys me again in my live room,

758
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
I'll block him and kick him out.

759
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,780
That's right. You should have done this.

760
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,220
You should have

761
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,860
blocked that...

762
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,820
That Mr. Lu.

763
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,380
Well, what you're saying

764
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,540
reminds me...

765
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,580
Of my son.

766
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,540
His father died at a young age.

767
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,940
He's my only son

768
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,900
and I brought him up alone.

769
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,140
In case he lives a bad life,

770
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,220
I've been spoiling him.

771
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,340
Sadly, he's spoiled.

772
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,300
It's been a long time

773
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,180
since he graduated.

774
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,940
Every day, he just fools around.

775
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,860
He's nothing like me.

776
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,420
Look, even though I'm aged,

777
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,980
I still learn to do flower arrangement

778
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,380
and sing songs.

779
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,340
Ordinary guys can't compare with you, Ms. Han.

780
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,860
And anyway, you're not aged.

781
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
It's so sweet of you.

782
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,420
When the soup is ready, have some more.

783
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,620
Thank you, Ms. Han.

784
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,820
How does it look?

785
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,500
Pretty good.

786
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,060
Ms. Han, I'll take a photo.

787
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,420
Come on.

788
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,580
Quite an expensive canteen.

789
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,340
500 for each diner, huh?

790
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,180
That's a lot of money, Miss Ji.

791
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,860
We owe them a big favor, you know.

792
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,340
Order more dishes you like.

793
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,660
Here.

794
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,820
With the investment,

795
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,420
we'll have normal business meals.

796
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,860
Give me a chance

797
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,140
to buy you a big lunch.

798
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,860
You can buy me a spicy hotpot.

799
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,020
Men will buy me expensive meals.

800
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,620
What are you up to these days?

801
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,460
Would you like to work in Xingchen?

802
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,060
Xingchen has just started,

803
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,020
but Dongyang Medical

804
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,180
backs it up.

805
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,340
If you join us, you can do

806
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,740
purchasing and sales.

807
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,540
You can help me as well.

808
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,980
Xing,

809
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,860
I don't want to bother you.

810
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,740
And being best friends

811
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,580
is different from being partners.

812
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,660
If something is mishandled,

813
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,420
I don't want it to affect our relationship.

814
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,540
I don't think that will happen.

815
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,820
You and I can separate life and work.

816
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,540
But now,

817
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,460
I can't give you a very good offer.

818
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,420
Capable as you are,

819
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,140
if you weren't in this trouble,

820
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,740
I wouldn't get a chance to recruit you.

821
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,580
Xingchen needs you.

822
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I need you, too.

823
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
I'll think about it.

824
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,140
Come on. Order more expensive food.

825
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,980
Miss Ji, Miss Li.

826
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,820
Mr. Lin.

827
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,740
What do you want me for?

828
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,740
I've reserved a private room.

829
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,740
Let's get in before we talk.

830
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,460
Miss Ji, you have good taste.

831
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,100
It's hard to reserve a private room

832
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,940
in this canteen.

833
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,340
Yeah. What do think of the food here?

834
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
Fancy.

835
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,860
Glad you like it.

836
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Thank you.

837
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,620
Miss Ji,

838
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,260
I hear you're close to Mr. Han.

839
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,180
Not too bad. We were schoolmates in college.

840
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,540
A company Mr. Han favors

841
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,300
must be very good.

842
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,060
Miss Ji, you and your company

843
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,500
have an amazing future.

844
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,940
Thanks.

845
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,020
Come on. A toast to you, Miss Ji.

846
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,740
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

847
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,820
Thank you for helping us.

848
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,340
My pleasure.

849
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,500
Just a little favor.

850
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,940
Miss Ji,

851
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,620
are you satisfied

852
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
with our product?

853
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,260
I am, of course.

854
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,620
Its performance

855
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,340
is as good as that of a foreign brand.

856
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,780
Good supporting service is provided, too.

857
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,820
That's right.

858
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,860
In terms of performance,

859
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,980
I'm very confident.

860
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,620
Well, Miss Ji,

861
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,700
since you think highly of our company...

862
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,380
Actually,

863
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,700
I do have a favor to ask.

864
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
Go ahead.

865
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,620
Look.

866
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
Now, business has got

867
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,740
rather difficult.

868
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm going to make a request of you.

869
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
Could you please

870
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,660
introduce us to Mr. Han

871
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,940
for future cooperation?

872
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,140
The boss of Beidi is interesting.

873
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,620
You've invested in so many companies.

874
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,540
If every grantee

875
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,180
could introduce people to you,

876
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,060
you would be way too busy.

877
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,180
Yeah, Miss Ji.

878
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,140
To you, this is

879
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,380
a very small favor.

880
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,420
As you're close to Mr. Han,

881
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
when you introduce us,

882
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,740
he'll meet us for your sake.

883
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,500
Rest assured, Miss Ji.

884
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,820
We are

885
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,860
very tight-lipped.

886
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,940
We won't gossip to anyone

887
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,940
about your relationship

888
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,980
with Mr. Han.

889
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,260
After you help us,

890
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,780
we will offer

891
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,060
what you deserve.

892
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,700
Ji Xing used to be

893
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,140
a technical guy.

894
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
But she turns out to be smart.

895
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,980
She takes advantage of you, too.

896
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,180
Don't get angry, though.

897
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,220
Ambitious guys like her

898
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
usually do this.

899
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,780
You got me here on purpose, right?

900
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,140
What do you think?

901
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,300
- I...
- Mr. Lin.

902
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,060
Let's handle things one after another.

903
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,540
A toast to you.

904
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,060
(Make do with the lunch talk.)
Today, we become acquainted.

905
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,660
Hope we'll help each other in the future.

906
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
OK.

907
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,780
Mr. Han and Miss Ji

908
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,340
are both technical guys.

909
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,340
Your company has such good products

910
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,140
and talent spotters will appear.

911
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,420
When lunch is over,

912
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,860
I'll invite you to karaoke.

913
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,140
OK. We can keep talking there.

914
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,260
I have to get back

915
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,460
to write some materials.

916
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,460
Next, I'll have

917
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,820
Miss Li talk to you.

918
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,860
It's the critical phase of our product.

919
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,020
Miss Ji

920
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,060
has to keep Mr. Han informed.

921
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,420
Please understand, Mr. Lin.

922
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,300
Do not misunderstand

923
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,380
that we think less of you.

924
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,580
I won't.

925
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,860
Come on.

926
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,420
A toast to you, Miss Ji.

927
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,460
- To pleasant cooperation.
- To pleasant cooperation.

928
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,020
- To cooperation.
- Yes.

929
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,060
What else would you like to order?

930
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,060
Miss Li, take care of them.

931
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,220
I'm going to the toilet.

932
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,060
Let's eat.

933
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,380
Enjoy your food.

934
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,340
Mr. Han.

935
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,580
Let's talk.

936
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,140
Who were you eating with?

937
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,340
Mr. Lin from Beidi.

938
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,340
You bought the printer

939
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,540
from them?

940
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,900
Yes.

941
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,940
Has my name

942
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,220
helped a lot?

943
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,860
How does it feel

944
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,420
to cheat others with my name?

945
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,380
I used to think

946
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,580
you worked hard and steadily.

947
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,540
You were so stubborn that you offended people.

948
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,540
Turns out I underestimated you.

949
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,060
You're really wise.

950
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,900
You don't need a teacher.

951
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,820
I just told them

952
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,260
you were my schoolmate in college.

953
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,540
We were indeed schoolmates.

954
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,820
I didn't lie.

955
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,580
That's why I say you used a good trick.

956
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,540
They just got the wrong idea.

957
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,660
You think you are not wrong?

958
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,300
Would you dare to say

959
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,340
you didn't give them the idea?

960
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,940
What relationship

961
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,060
do they think we have?

962
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,060
An affair.

963
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,620
Right?

964
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,060
In this case,

965
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,060
since I'm slandered,

966
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,140
I'll make it true.

967
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,220
I...

968
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,780
Look at you.

969
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,580
You're so scared when I joke.

970
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,820
When someone else

971
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,580
says something dirtier,

972
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
can you bear that?

973
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,140
I don't care about pink news.

974
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,020
But it will hurt you.

975
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,940
If you can't bear the consequences,

976
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,580
don't take a shortcut.

977
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,580
To take a shortcut,

978
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,980
you have to pay a price.
