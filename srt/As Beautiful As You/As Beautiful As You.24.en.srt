00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
Do you not drink, either?

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,910
Come on.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Here, Miss Ji.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,120
I'll drink it up.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
In this case,

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Cheers.

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Miss Ji, you can't drink with all of us

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,630
with only one glass of wine.

36
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,400
We're OK with it.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,240
But Mr. Chang is a big shot.

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,310
Show some respect and drink with him alone.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,680
Hey, Zhu.

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,030
Why did you suddenly

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,310
get me involved?

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,150
Let's do this, then.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Miss Ji,

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,470
a toast to you.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
Hey, Miss Ji.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
Mr. Chang has some spirit.

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,400
Mixed wine will get her drunk.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,750
Don't give her a hard time.

49
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,710
Even Mr. Han defends you.

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,400
Miss Ji, you're awesome.

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
Mr. Chang,

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
I don't think you can

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,150
drink with Miss Ji.

54
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,520
Mr. Han has a point.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Miss Ji is a lady.

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,190
We shouldn't make her drink.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
Let's drink, then.

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,190
OK.

59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,430
Cool, Mr. Chang.

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,750
Mr. Chang, you hold your liquor.

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,270
Hey, Mr. Han.

62
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,710
For your sake, Mr. Chang

63
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,000
didn't make Miss Ji drink.

64
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Shouldn't you drink

65
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,840
for his sake?

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
Mr. Chang, a toast to you.

67
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,870

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,270

71
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,190
a lot of girls will fall in love.

72
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,350
Excuse me.

73
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,270
We have things to do and we have to go.

Medicine.

75
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,510
You drank some wine?

76
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,720
Are you OK? Do you need to see a doctor?

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,590
I'm fine.

78
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,270
I'll be all right soon.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Tang Song.

80
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Here.

81
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,600
Check what Chang He and Zhu Houyu

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
have been doing privately.

83
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,240
OK. I get it.

84
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,880
Hello.

85
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,120
Ji Xing, something went wrong
with Zhang Fengmei.

86
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,870
Her spine is deformed and displaced.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,040
She's in hospital again.

88
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
Come to the Innovation Center soon.

89
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,510
How did it happen?

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I'll be right there.

91
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,360
Something's wrong with the volunteer.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
I have to go immediately.

93
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,800
Tang Song, drive to the Innovation Center.

94
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,480
Don't. You should take some rest.

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll handle that.

96
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll go with you.

97
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,020
(Xinggang Hospital)

98
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,310
What on earth happened?

99
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,190
Shortly after the volunteer checked out,

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,270
she accidentally stepped on something at home,

101
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,720
fell from the stairs,

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
and had a skeletal displacement.

103
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,400
Her old injury reoccurred.

104
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,270
Old injury?

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Yes. But before,

106
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,310
among all the clinical tests,

107
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,200
this has never happened.

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,390
Even if she accidentally fell,

109
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,800
she wouldn't have been so serious.

110
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,590
I'm thinking

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,920
if it's the product...

112
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,800
You think something's wrong with our product?

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,750
Bring up her medical record

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,800
and check it again.

115
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,540
(CT Report)

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,590
Ji Xing.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
I've bought the presents.

118
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Hi, Mr. Han.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,390
Let's go check on Zhang Fengmei.

120
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
Come on.

121
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,800
Why did you come

122
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,720
with Han Ting?

123
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,430
We were having dinner with some men.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,800
So, we came together.

125
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,790
Hey, Zhizhou.

126
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,230
You don't come here.

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Go back to Xingchen

128
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,270
and bring up the data
of our intervertebral cage.

129
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,600
Recheck the data

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
with Zhang Fengmei's record.

131
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,790
OK, OK.

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
- Which ward?
- That one.

133
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry for the trouble.

134
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,600
It's not your fault to be injured.

135
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,270
Don't have psychological weights.

136
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,440
Actually...

137
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
No...

138
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Nothing.

139
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,030
If you have any problem,

140
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
feel free to tell us.

141
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
We'll try to help you.

142
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,670
I just...

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,840
I feel sorry for you.

144
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
You tried so hard to help me.

145
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,040
Don't worry.

146
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,600
When the doctors work out a therapy,

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,910
we'll have you treated again.

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,510
But you must listen to the doctors.

149
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,320
Have meals regularly and sleep well.

150
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Come on.

151
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,200
Do you think Zhang Fengmei was a little weird?

152
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,510
Yes, indeed.

153
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,390
She wanted to say something but broke off.

154
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,030
There must be something fishy.

155
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,870
Have her treated first.

156
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,790
We can communicate later.

157
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,390
But what on earth happened?

158
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Nothing is wrong with our product.

159
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,440
Even if she didn't do what the doctors said,

160
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
she wouldn't have been so serious.

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,670
Come on. Think no more.

162
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,000
Relax your mind.

163
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,840
Mr. Han, you're still here?

164
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,150
Please drive Ji Xing back.

165
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
I have things to do and I have to go.

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
- I...
- Bye-bye.

167
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,910
I'll take a taxi.

168
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll drive you.

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
Let's go.

170
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,000
Before the result comes out,

171
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
don't think too much.

172
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,910
I was too busy to remember this.

173
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,270
I should have taken you

174
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,440
to see a doctor there.

175
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,600
I'm fine. Don't worry.

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,630

177
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,550

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,200
it may indicate something special?

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,600
♪I tried to let you be my destiny♪

193
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,410
♪The stars are shining thru the day and night♪

194
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,080
♪Endlessly♪

195
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,750
I don't know

196
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,840
what relationship we're in.

197
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,240
What relationship

198
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,670
do you think we are in?

199
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,640
♪Restlessly♪

200
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,080
♪You are everything♪

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,630
Xing.

202
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Mr. Han.

203
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,910
Mr. Han, how about you get in?

204
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,440
Anything else?

205
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,510
Do you need me to take the garbage down?

206
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,110
Thanks.

207
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,080
You're welcome.

208
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,150
Such a gentleman.

209
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,600
Xing!

210
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,600
How far have you and Mr. Han gotten?

211
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,320
Just now, he helped me dump the garbage.

212
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,840
He's such a gentleman.

213
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,550
Honey, don't worry.

214
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,080
I'll be right back.

215
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Leaving again?

216
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,840
Some family emergency.

217
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,390
Always the family emergency.

218
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,870
But you never let me go to your place.

219
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Keeping another lady there?

220
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,270
No way.

221
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,840
You know.

222
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,750
You're my only girl.

223
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,030
Then how soon can I go to your place?

224
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
Give me more time,

225
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,710
will you?

226
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,270
How much time do you want?

227
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,320
Ten days?

228
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,710
Half a month?

229
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,510
Or one year?

230
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
We're a couple.

231
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,030
Why do you not tell me anything?

232
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,160
Sorry.

233
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,480
It's my fault.

234
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,790
OK. Out you go.

235
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,360
Go to bed early.

236
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,120
Di, I hear Bay Phase II

237
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,480
has been going very well.

238
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,030
Not bad.

239
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,110
For the implementation thing,

240
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,270
I'll still count on you.

241
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,550
Congratulations.

242
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,350
I don't often see

243
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,510
Han Ting drink any wine.

244
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,110
He's allergic to alcohol.

245
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,070
He never drinks.

246
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,030
At today's dinner,

247
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,070
he drank a whole pot of wine with me.

248
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,350
He did?

249
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,880
For Ji Xing from Xingchen Technology.

250
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,160
So, he was just protecting her.

251
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,390
In my opinion,

252
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,680
a man can really do anything

253
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,270
for his beloved woman.

254
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,750
He's Ji Xing's investor.

255
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,640
It's normal to drink for her, huh?

256
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
You're right.

257
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,550
A man is born to care about women.

258
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,270
Di, if you have to drink at a dinner,

259
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,480
I'll also drink it for you.

260
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,270
I can hold my liquor.

261
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,280
Quite enough.

262
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,350
It's your turn. Come on.

263
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,110
You pour some first.

264
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,950
Who's that?

265
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,350
A little more.

266
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
Hello.

267
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,270
I have a business to talk with you about.

268
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,240
I wonder if you're interested.

269
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,080
Say it.

270
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,580
(Dongyang Group)

271
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,880
Who are they?

272
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,680
Come on. Stop looking.

273
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
What do we do?

274
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,910
Hello, Yichen.

275
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,320
Ji Xing,

276
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,480
Zhang Fengmei is missing.

277
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,240
We can't reach her now.

278
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,590
She's in Dongyang Building.

279
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What's going on?

280
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,960
As scheduled,

281
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,030
she'll have the surgery soon.

282
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,200
Why did she leave

283
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
at this moment?

284
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,030
And you're only the supplier.

285
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,480
They must be deliberately making a scene

286
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,920
in your company.

287
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,400
There must be something fishy.

288
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Ji Xing,

289
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,000
if you can manage

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,790
to take Zhang Fengmei back for the surgery,

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,960
it won't be too late.

292
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
OK. I get it.

293
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Don't worry too much.

294
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,720
If you need,

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,110
I can go and explain it for you.

296
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,240
Not now.

297
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,590
I'll hang up.

298
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
Miss Li, what do we do?

299
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,590
Xing,

300
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,160
what do we do now?

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,750
How about I go downstairs

302
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,750
and talk to them?

303
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,590
Don't. When they make a scene,

304
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,790
they must be out of their mind.

305
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,480
Xing, shall we consult an attorney first?

306
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,750
Zhizhou, have you checked

307
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,790
Zhang Fengmei's medical record

308
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,750
and our materials?

309
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,830
Yes. Nothing is wrong.

310
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,680
They're just blackmailing us.

311
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, Zhizhou and Li Li,

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
let's go downstairs and check.

313
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,070
See if we can persuade them

314
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
- to send Zhang to the hospital.
- OK.

315
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,880
The rest of you, go back to work.

316
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,190
- Sure.
- OK.

317
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,960
Whatever happens,

318
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
do not be impulsive.

319
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,860
(Xingchen Technology, evil company!)

320
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,790
The top priority

321
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,790
is your health.

322
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,310
If you still waste time,

323
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,590
you can't be cured anymore.

324
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,150
I...

325
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,910
What are you doing?

326
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,550
Isn't my wife miserable enough?

327
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,720
Still want to fool her?

328
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,160
You agreed on the surgery yesterday.

329
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,440
Why did you change your mind?

330
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,960
She's the boss of Xingchen Technology.

331
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,240
She ruined my wife!

332
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,550
- Evil merchant!
- Evil merchant!

333
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,840
Compensation!

334
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,720
OK, stop.

335
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,590
Stop.

336
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,200
Chill down.

337
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's talk.

338
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,920
I won't talk.

339
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,590
Pay us, or we won't talk.

340
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,590
You're blackmailing, you know?

341
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Blackmailing?

342
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,270
You're being irresponsible, OK?

343
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,440
Don't talk nonsense.

344
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,550
What do you want,

345
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,830
to solve the problem or make a scene?

346
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,240
You can't save your wife by making a scene.

347
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,550
Why would I listen to an evil boss?

348
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,030
It's you who lied to my wife

349
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,070
that the surgery could solve her waist problem.

350
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,950
What happened, then?

351
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,960
You shouldn't be Xingchen Technology,

352
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,110
but Hell Technology.

353
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,000
The hospital has offered

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,960
a follow-up treatment plan.

355
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,790
The top priority is to cure her.

356
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
If she misses the treatment,

357
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,720
she'll really be ruined
for the rest of her life.

358
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,560
OK.

359
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,800
She'll take a treatment.

360
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,790
She certainly will.

361
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,830
Let's discuss the compensation first.

362
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,590
After that, I'll send her
to a regular hospital.

363
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
She won't take the treatment

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
from this evil company

365
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,550
that doesn't care for human lives!

366
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,830
Evil company! Pay the compensation!

367
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,070
Pay the compensation!

368
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,350
Mr. Han,

369
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,880
I had a nice conversation with Mr. Luo.

370
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,000
He's very professional.

371
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,310
He has a strong execution, too.

372
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Good.

373
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,880
But Mr. Han...

374
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,240
Say it.

375
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
I don't know what plan

376
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,070
you have for Xingchen.

377
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,350
Once our relationship

378
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,200
is revealed,

379
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,240
will the board of directors

380
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,510
allow Dongyang Medical to have

381
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
two homogeneous competing companies?

382
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,310
Don't get me wrong.

383
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,440
You know,

384
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,680
Xingchen is developing faster

385
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,790
than everyone expected.

386
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,440
Their intervertebral cage

387
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
was quickly completed.

388
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,350
The clinical test is going smoothly, too.

389
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,440
But anyway,

390
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,640
one nation can't have two queens.

391
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,440
Mr. Han,

392
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,270
do you consider

393
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,000
merging Xingchen into Hanhai?

394
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,720
Xingchen is developing very fast.

395
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,830
But in all cases,

396
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,960
it's still no match for Hanhai.

397
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,400
It's too early for the merger.

398
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,200
Besides,

399
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,440
she won't want that.

400
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,080
Boss.

401
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
Xingchen is in trouble.

402
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,000
Sorry. We'll talk next time.

403
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,320
See you, Mr. Han.

404
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,640
We'll stop making a scene.

405
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,440
You just go back.

406
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,480
You must be tired.

407
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,400
Go have some water.

408
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,590
Your mouth is peeling.

409
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
We will

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
sit here for a while.

411
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,550
Before Xingchen gives us money,

412
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,960
we will not leave.

413
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,640
I said,

414
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,960
before figuring out the truth,

415
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,030
I won't give you any money.

416
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,030
She doesn't want to pay.

417
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,480
Oh, you hit me.

418
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,590
I didn't hit him.

419
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,960
He pulled my hand.

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,240
- Calm down.
- Let go.

421
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,000
He framed me!

422
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,240
He actually hit me.

423
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Let go!

424
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
Let go, OK?

425
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,760
Get up.

426
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,960
- What are you doing?
- How dare you hit him?

427
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,190
Are you OK?

428
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm OK.

429
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,960
Stop, Guilan.

430
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,880
When Zhang Fengmei applied to be a volunteer,

431
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,310
you signed an agreement.

432
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,310
Any problem after the surgery

433
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,550
has nothing to do with Xingchen.

434
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
So what?

435
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,400
What I signed

436
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,680
wasn't a death warrant.

437
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,630
Besides,

438
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,110
they failed to cure my wife.

439
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,080
Shouldn't they pay?

440
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,440
The whole surgery is recorded.

441
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,350
Xingchen's products

442
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,680
have been tested.

443
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,590
If you have an objection,

444
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,880
or if you don't believe it

445
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,030
and want to figure out the truth,

446
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,160
have the police investigate us.

447
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,270
Xu, Xu.

448
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,400
Forget it. Let it go.

449
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,790
Why would I?

450
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,240
OK. We can leave.

451
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
But you have to pay.

452
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,080
Tang Song.

453
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,590
Hello, sir.

454
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,240
Let's talk over here.

455
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,270
Tang Song, what will you do?

456
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,830
Give him some money?

457
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,070
Don't give him any money!

458
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,030
If you do, he won't take care of Zhang Fengmei!

459
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,750
Stop it. People are videoing.

460
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,080
Let's go.

461
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,960
You needn't have interfered.

462
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,440
If you don't want me to interfere,

463
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,720
you should be capable enough to solve it.

464
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,680
I was solving it.

465
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,640
How did you?

466
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,440
You went wrong in the first place.

467
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,350
In this case,

468
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,000
the Innovation Center is also responsible.

469
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,480
You needn't have faced them alone.

470
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Can you not always think

471
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
by standing your own ground?

472
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,480
Xingchen isn't Dongyang.

473
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,320
We're not strong enough

474
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,110
to break with the Innovation Center.

475
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
Otherwise, the test will be suspended.

476
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,510
Then we'll have the most to lose.

477
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,070
You're quite realistic.

478
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,920
So, I solved the problem for you.

479
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,270
Shouldn't you thank me?

480
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,510
You only solved it

481
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,750
by asking Tang Song to pay him.

482
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,720
It means Xingchen is wrong.

483
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,110
What is right?

484
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,520
What is wrong?

485
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,110
When you quarreled with them

486
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,240
on behalf of Xingchen,

487
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,440
you were wrong.

488
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,680
There was even a fight in public.

489
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,790
Didn't you see people around
were taking photos,

490
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,440
videoing and even doing live streaming?

491
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,480
So what?

492
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,310
We didn't make the first move.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,240
Back there, I was talking

494
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,720
about facts and reasons.

495
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,240
Even if it's posted on the Internet,

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,440
the public opinion won't be favorable to them.

497
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,390
And then?

498
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,480
Then I'll have Zhang Fengmei cured.

499
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
In this way, won't it be

500
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,640
a great PR solution?

501
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
It'll be an advertisement, too.

502
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,750
But you pulled me away

503
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,160
and solved the problem with money.

504
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,550
Wouldn't it indicate

505
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,110
that Xingchen was guilty?

506
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,790
And you could also tell

507
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,440
that man was terrible.

508
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,440
With the money,

509
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,510
he will not care about Zhang Fengmei.

510
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,310
You know what kind of man he is.

511
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,880
Why do you think you can save her?

512
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,920
This patient with such a terrible family...

513
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,720
How dare you give her a second surgery?

514
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,750
But I can't just watch

515
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,750
Zhang Fengmei become crippled and do nothing.

516
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,110
I'll keep communicating with her

517
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,510
and telling her what she can't do.

518
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,270
Do you think she was injured again

519
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,030
because you weren't clear of this last time?

520
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,720
This is an accident.

521
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,640
It's not your fault.

522
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,830
Now you know it hurts?

523
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,640
Just now, you didn't care.

524
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,160
I helped you, but you were so rude.

525
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,750
Leave me alone, then.

526
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,280
I can't help caring.

527
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,320
Don't struggle.

528
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,480
Why would I listen to you?

529
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,030
I'm not your robot.

530
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,720
Hungry, huh?

531
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,160
I haven't had anything to eat today.

532
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Take some rest.

533
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,070
I'll cook for you.

534
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,680
Zhizhou, how's everything going there?

535
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,940
(Ji Xing)

536
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,480
(Su Zhizhou)
They have left.

537
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,200
OK. Let's think

538
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,640
about how we should handle this case

539
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,510
to minimize the impact.

540
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,900
(Ji Xing)

541
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,960
Don't worry.

542
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
We won't make a scene again.

543
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,200
Hope you'll keep your promise.

544
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,110
I will.

545
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,240
- Be careful.
- OK.

546
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,350
The problem is solved?

547
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,640
Xu Zhuang wanted nothing but money.

548
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,030
He was eager to negotiate with us.

549
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,070
It didn't take a long time.

550
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
Did he accept the conditions?

551
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,950
Yes.

552
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,310
He signed the pledge.

553
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,510
I'll send the scanned version

554
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,590
to your phone.

555
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
Got it.

556
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,910
What are you reading?

557
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,200
Two posts

558
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,790
where Xingchen is questioned.

559
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,640
Check this.

560
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
(Pledge)

561
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,830
I pledge,

562
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,830
Zhang Fengmei's waist injury

563
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,960
has nothing to do with Xingchen Technology.

564
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,720
Xu Zhuang signed it?

565
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,360
Anyway, the problem is solved.

566
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,710
You can stop worrying, huh?

567
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,510
Wait a second. The lunch will be ready.

568
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,840
Oh, here is a fish tank.

569
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,590
You didn't notice it last time?

570
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,440
Why is there no fish in it?

571
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,320
My grandaunt thought I lived a monotonous life

572
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,840
and asked me to keep some fish

573
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,280
to make my life colorful.

574
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,360
But I have no time to keep fish.

575
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,840
Look.

576
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,230
She thinks

577
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,710
you're usually too rigid.

578
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,110
You should learn to be
as flexible and cute as fish.

579
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,710
Unexpectedly, you only keep some water.

580
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,030
Doesn't it make this flat lonelier?

581
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,470
It does?

582
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,760
I don't think so.

583
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,590
You still keep it?

584
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,800
This one is for you.

585
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:11,630
But I don't drink.

586
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,400
That's why I give it to you.

587
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
When I drink next time,

588
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,710
you can clink it with me.

589
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,070
Thanks.

590
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,110
You're welcome.

591
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,230
What are you staring at?

592
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,200
Lunch is ready.

593
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,630
What exactly did you make,

594
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,000
food or artwork?

595
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,510
Food is different.

596
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,960
Pumpkin symbolizes wealth.

597
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,280
In some places, the pumpkin soup

598
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,440
is called Soup of Wealth.

599
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,880
Here. Taste it.

600
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,230
In this way, Xingchen

601
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,150
will not collapse.

602
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,230
What about other dishes?

603
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,480
What do they symbolize?

604
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,320
The language of pineapple

605
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,360
is good luck.

606
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,630
In southern Fujian,

607
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,360
people call pineapple

608
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,440
"Brimming Luck".

609
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,710
Because in their dialect, it's "Bringing Luck".

610
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,280
What luck?

611
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,550
Brimming Luck.

612
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,230
Bringing Luck?

613
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,510
B-R-I-M-M-I-N-G.

614
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
B-R-I-M...

615
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,600
- Luck.
- Luck.

616
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,920
Wait. You just said it meant good luck.

617
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,480
Shouldn't there be a "good"?

618
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,070
Brimming...

619
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,190
Brimming Good Luck, huh?

620
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,550
Brimming Good... Luck.

621
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,600
You're right.

622
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,030
But I'm curious.

623
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,070
Why does all food symbolize something?

624
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,030
When people are fed,

625
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,760
they will find emotional values

626
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,230
from the food.

627
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,710
So, food like this

628
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,880
symbolizes something.

629
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,230
How does it taste?

630
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,440
How can it taste so good?

631
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,710
Thank you, Chef,

632
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,230
for this big lunch.

633
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,760
To thank me,

634
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,630
you should do more than talking.

635
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,550
What do you mean?

636
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,320
Will you try it?

637
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,630
Why do you ask now?

638
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,800
Since I taste your food,

639
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,920
I have to say yes.

640
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,150
What are you thinking?

641
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,030
I didn't specify what to try.

642
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,150

Mr. Han,

664
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,070
I received the acquisition contract.

665
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,070
But some details

666
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,320
in this contract...

667
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,510
I think they should

668
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,760
be adjusted.

669
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,280
Mr. Zhu, do you think

670
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,590
you can adjust my contract

671
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,590
just as you wish?

672
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,480
Mr. Han,

673
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,000
try to understand me.

674
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,480
Business is hard for me.

675
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
How about this?

676
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,360
Give me more time.

677
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,440
I'll think about the price.

678
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,000
I was about to ask you.

679
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,070
Why do you have

680
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,000
women's bathrobe and slippers?

681
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,030
I prepared them for you.

682
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,360

Why?

688
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,990
