23
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,640
One day, when Hanhai

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,230
is powerful enough,

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,240
will it...?

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,790
Will it annex Xingchen?

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,200
Xingchen plans to go its own way.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,200
But someday, will it

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,150
have nowhere to go?

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,960
Even when Han Ting was in Germany,

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
he invested in Hanhai.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
When he was just back in China,

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,150
he had a shaky foundation.

34
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,280
Han Yuan could have a lot of ways

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,960
to stop him from merging Hanhai.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
Then he made a pledge,

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,240
buying himself some time
to reform Dongyang Medical

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
and make preparations for Hanhai's merger.

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,520
As for Xingchen...

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,800
It's just a smokescreen.

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,560
Xing.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,960
Xing?

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
Xing?

44
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,980
(Merger Proposal of Hanhai and Xingchen)

45
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,540

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,220
(The name is supposed to be
"Hanhai Xingchen Technology".)

51
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,270
Come in.

52
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,870
What? What brings you to see me?

53
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,800
Series-A funding.

54
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,560
Take your seats.

55
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,750
Now, many investors want

56
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,070
to invest in Xingchen.

57
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
We have enough options.

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
But you should choose one soon.

59
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,160
What do you guys think?

60
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
Should we

61
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,240
prioritize Dongyang Medical?

62
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,230
No.

63
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,630
With another financing,

64
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,870
their shares and our shares

65
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,000
will be diluted.

66
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,480
If we take the investment from an outsider,

67
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,800
with a majority of the stock,

68
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,600
we'll still have the decision-making power.

69
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,800
But if we still take it from Dongyang Medical,

70
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,430
we may possibly be...

71
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,510
A total figurehead.

72
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,600
Considering Xing and Mr. Han's relationship,

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't think it'll happen.

74
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,040
Love is love.

75
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,390
Business is business.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
Xing,

77
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,160
we just give you some advice.

78
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,920
You make your own choice soon.

79
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,430
I'll think about it.

80
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,600
OK. I'll go back to work.

81
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,040
What happened?

82
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,710
You don't look very well.

83
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm fine. I guess I've been too tired.

84
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,480
I just need some rest.

85
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,430
When the financing is over,

86
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,560
have some days off

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,950
for some good rest.

88
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,430
Boss, will Miss Ji not go with you?

89
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,680
She has left.

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,950
One day, when Hanhai is powerful enough,

91
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,030
will it...?

92
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,560
Will it annex Xingchen?

93
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,830
Xingchen plans to go its own way.

94
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,950
But someday, will it

95
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,800
have nowhere to go?

96
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,560
The market needs Hanhai.

97
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,200
It needs Xingchen, too.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
You don't need to compare.

99
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,480
Han Ting.

100
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,550
Do you love me?

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
How do you define love?

102
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,510
You'll die for me.

103
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,080
Without me, your world will collapse.

104
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,960
That's not the love I understand.

105
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,840
What is your definition, then?

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,750
First, match.

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
Xing,

108
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,150
"match" isn't a pathetic word.

109
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,870
“Love” isn't noble, either.

110
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,870
It's hard to find

111
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,750
the right person.

112
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,840
Why do you get me here so early?

113
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,030
What's up?

114
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,390
The water is boiling away. Don't you make tea?

115
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
She knew it.

116
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,110
Who?

117
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
Ji Xing.

118
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,440
You finally told her.

119
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,030
I no longer need to worry.

120
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,030
She knew it from someone else.

121
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,240
Not me.

122
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,550
What did she say? Where's she?

123
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,550
Discussing Series-A funding with Chang He.

124
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Chang He?

125
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,670
Why don't you stop her immediately?

126
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,240
She's angry now.

127
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,550
There's no point in talking.

128
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,630
You've made up your mind?

129
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,150
For this investment in Xingchen,

130
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,360
I'll use a third-party investment company.

131
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,750
No word will get out.

132
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:40,870
In this way,

133
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,630
the directors of Dongyang Medical

134
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,080
will approve the investment.

135
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,790
Miss Ji, don't worry.

136
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,390
Can you make it quick?

137
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
Of course.

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,600
OK.

139
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,380
(Series-A Funding Agreement)

140
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,220
Boss,

141
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,480
Miss Ji has agreed to the cooperation

142
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
with a Series-A funding company.

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shall we talk to her?

144
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,840
No need.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,510
Hold the board meeting.

146
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,750
OK.

147
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Congratulations, Mr. Chang,

148
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,910
for investing in Xingchen.

149
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,390
Thanks, Ms. Yuan.

150
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,440
Without your help

151
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,870
at the board meeting,

152
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
the financing proposal

153
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,080
wouldn't have been smoothly approved.

154
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,440
Mr. Chang,

155
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,720
it has nothing to do with me.

156
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,670
Ms. Yuan, don't worry.

157
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,270
I'll keep it very secret.

158
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,510
When the directors realize

159
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,750
Tongke has invested

160
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,960
in Xingchen's third-party company,

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,510
become a shareholder of Xingchen,

162
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,080
and touched Dongyang Medical's assets,

163
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,670
I'll see what Han Ting can explain.

164
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,320
Impressive, Ms. Yuan.

165
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,200
This time, even if Han Ting

166
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
fulfills his pledge,

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,840
the directors will still blame him.

168
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,790
Then your next logical step

169
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,720
is to take back Dongyang Medical.

170
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,440
But Han Ting always

171
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
has many precautions.

172
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,870
At this financing meeting,

173
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,360
he cast a yes vote

174
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
without hesitation.

175
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,080
I fear he has some other plans.

176
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,670
I used a third-party company.

177
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,000
It's normal that he doesn't know it's me.

178
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,390
Even if he does,

179
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,670
he can't

180
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,080
overturn the directors' resolution.

181
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,550
Ms. Yuan, don't worry.

182
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Why are you back?

183
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,360
I'll live with you for a few days.

184
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,670
You don't want me here?

185
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,360
I want you. I totally do.

186
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,320
When you were away,

187
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,600
I missed you so much.

188
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,480
I made some soup. Would you like some?

189
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,910
No. I want some sleep.

190
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,910
Fine. Go get some sleep.

191
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,360
When you wake up,

192
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,960
we'll go have a big meal.

193
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,900
(Dongyang Group)

194
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,750
I will redraft

195
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,630
the sales goals

196
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,840
for the next month.

197
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,110
OK.

198
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,680
The meeting is over.

199
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,560
Dismissed.

200
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
Xing.

201
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,550
Our Series-A funding

202
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,790
has been approved by Dongyang Medical.

203
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,200
We can move to the next step.

204
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,300
(Series-A Funding Agreement)

205
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,790
OK. I'll have it arranged.

206
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,150
Fine. I'll go back to work.

207
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,550
Anything wrong with the financing?

208
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,720
How come?

209
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,150
It's very smooth. Don't worry.

210
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,790
These days, you've been absent-minded.

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,390
Is everything all right?

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,030
Yes. Don't worry about me.

213
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,550
I'm really fine.

214
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,240
Tonight, I'll dine at Xingyue Club

215
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
with Mr. Ma of Kebo Material.

216
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
Will you go?

217
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,840
I have something else to handle.

218
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,720
You guys go. I won't.

219
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,790
Fine. I'll go with Zhizhou, then.

220
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,120
Don't put all the pressure on yourself.

221
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,750
You have us.

222
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,630
I'm fine.

223
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,200
I won't.

224
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Congratulations.

225
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,670
You've got shares of Xingchen.

226
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,670
Mr. Chang, you keep your word.

227
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,510
It's the first gift you give me.

228
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,160
Thanks.

229
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Next, how will you

230
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
deal with Xingchen?

231
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Check this.

232
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,580

234
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,740

all shares of Guanghua to Party B.)

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,020
(Party A: Dongyang Medical)

236
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,750
What do you mean?

237
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,990
Mr. Han.

238
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,870
You wanted to see me in such a hurry.

239
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,120
What for?

240
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,000
Mr. Chang, I guess you know that.

241
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
I know a lot of things.

242
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,910
But I'm not clear

243
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,750
about every single one.

244
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,940
(Share Purchase Agreement)

245
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,960
Mr. Han, why are you so sure

246
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
that you're offering

247
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,680
what I want?

248
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,350
Everybody knows what you want,

249
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,880
don't they?

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
You offer to exchange

251
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,510
all your shares of Guanghua

252
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,550
for my few shares

253
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,270
of Xingchen.

254
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,830
So, Mr. Han,

255
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,070
you really care about Xingchen.

256
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,110
Will you or will you accept?

257
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,310
I appreciate your sincerity, Mr. Han.

258
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,400
I just wonder

259
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,750
if Miss Ji Xing

260
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,110
will be upset.

261
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,510
That is not your concern.

262
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,270
Han Ting offered me

263
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,790
all his shares of Guanghua.

264
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,440
I couldn't say no.

265
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,590
So, in his eyes,

266
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,880
Guanghua is just like rubbish.

267
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,070
He dumped it so causally.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,310
But I take Guanghua

269
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,510
as my treasure.

270
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,480
Bay is important.

271
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,350
But what I want more

272
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,000
is that you're no longer involved

273
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,510
with Han Ting.

274
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,200
He thinks the same way, right?

275
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,510
Mr. Chang, don't worry.

276
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,110
From this day on,

277
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,960
Guanghua and Tongke

278
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,720
will be real allies.

279
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,680
Mr. Ma, thank you

280
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,200
for supporting Xingchen all the time.

281
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
We couldn't have come this far

282
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
without the superior materials

283
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
from your company.

284
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,960
It's very kind of you.

285
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,920
Above all,

286
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,160
Xingchen has made

287
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
very good products.

288
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,960
My materials

289
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,000
are just like the cherry on top.

290
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,750
Well, I also want to thank you

291
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,480
for buying materials from my company.

292
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,880
Come on. A toast to you, Mr. Su and Miss Li.

293
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,800
Mr. Ma.

294
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm a technical guy.

295
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,550
So, I know it very well.

296
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,550
Without your superior materials,

297
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,790
our product research

298
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,240
couldn't have gone so smoothly.

299
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,590
So, now,

300
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,310
I should propose a toast to you.

301
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,350
Hope our future cooperation

302
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
will go more smoothly.

303
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,550
- Cheers.
- OK. Hope everything goes well.

304
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,430
Cheers.

305
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
Mr. Ma, sorry to disturb you.

306
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
There you are, Mr. Xiao.

307
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, I know everybody here.

308
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,640
Come on. A toast to you.

309
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,670
OK.

310
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,590
Miss Li, you have a stomach problem.

311
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,960
Don't drink wine.

312
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,110
Have a beverage instead.

313
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,550
Miss Li can't drink, indeed.

314
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,550
But to show

315
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,680
our sincerity,

316
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,680
I'll propose a toast to you

317
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,150
on behalf of Miss Li.

318
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,240
I have things to do.

319
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,680
I'll leave you alone.

320
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,960
Have a good time.

321
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,110
The treat is on me.

322
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,070
OK. See you.

323
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,590
Come on, Mr. Ma.

324
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,550
Let's continue.

325
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,390
OK.

326
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,480
Mr. Su, you can hold your liquor.

327
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,830
Come on. Let's drink.

328
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
You flatter me.

329
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,510
Mr. Ma, we're glad to have you here.

330
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,590
- Enjoy the food.
- Cheers.

331
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,270
Cheers.

332
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,240
Come on, Mr. Ma. Don't just drink.

333
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,270
Taste the dishes.

334
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,000
Here.

335
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,320
Madam,

336
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,880
your meal is on the house.

337
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,160
You don't need to pay.

338
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,510
No need. I'll pay.

339
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,510
How much? I'll scan and pay.

340
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,880
Sorry,

341
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,270
but Mr. Xiao told us

342
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,480
not to charge you.

343
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,720
Let me see the bill, then.

344
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,590
Thanks.

345
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,150
Li Li.

346
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,590
I was about to see you.

347
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,070
Just now, I asked the chef

348
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,270
to make you some sweet yam soup

349
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,680
with honey and milk.

350
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,270
It will be delivered soon.

351
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,350
You have a weak stomach.

352
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,880
Keep it well.

353
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
No need.

354
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,510
I transferred the money to you.

355
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,920
I didn't mean to come here tonight.

356
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,920
Mr. Ma picked this place.

357
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,070
I want no connection to you anymore.

358
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,920
You don't need to do anything for me.

359
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,720
Li Li.

360
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,240
Li Li, give me a minute.

361
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,350
I really want to talk with you.

362
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,590
There's nothing we can talk about.

363
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,790
Li Li, listen to me.

364
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,790
Listen.

365
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,000
We can have a try.

366
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,150
Forget it.

367
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,270
If you had said this earlier,

368
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,880
I would be happy.

369
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,110
But now, I've figured it out.

370
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,720
Let's just split.

371
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,310
It was all my fault.

372
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,680
Don't be angry. Give me...

373
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,160
Mr. Xiao,

374
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,790
don't push it.

375
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,510
It's between Li Li and me.

376
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,070
Mr. Su,

377
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,350
do not interfere.

378
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,190
Li Li, give me a second...

379
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,070
When can you stop hurting her?

380
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,750
If you break your promise again,

381
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,000
what can she do?

382
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Say no more.

383
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,390
Li Li,

384
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,070
what is wrong with you?

385
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,750
He fooled you again and again.

386
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,480
When do you say enough is enough?

387
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,400
The old you

388
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
recklessly slapped your client

389
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,880
who discredited you.

390
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,750
But look at you now.

391
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,720
Will you really trample on your principles

392
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,480
again and again like this?

393
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,960
This isn't the lady

394
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,190
I'm in love with.

395
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Li Li.

396
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,790
- I...
- Xiao Yixiao.

397
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,070
He's right.

398
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,000
When I was waiting for you to change,

399
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
I conceded too much.

400
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,880
Now that you have principles,

401
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,440
stick to your bottom line.

402
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,680
I don't like you this way.

403
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,110
Nor can I allow myself

404
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,070
to keep conceding like this.

405
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,920
We're done here.

406
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,160
Tired, huh? I'm washing some strawberries.

407
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,680
You can eat some later.

408
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,440
I've cooperated with Chang He.

409
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,200
The third-party company

410
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,350
of Xingchen's Series-A funding

411
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,200
is Tongke.

412
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,590
I know.

413
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,790
You're not angry?

414
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,880
You want me to be angry?

415
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,880
You have nothing to say to me?

416
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,790
I should ask you this.

417
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,440
Aren't you supposed to tell me

418
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,070
why you did that?

419
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,310
Tongke is my competitor.

420
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,200
What were you thinking?

421
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,350
Do you even care?

422
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,510
You have Hanhai.

423
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,310
Do you really care who Xingchen belongs to?

424
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,480
Or do you think everything
is under your control?

425
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,880
You'd rather destroy Xingchen

426
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,200
than give it to someone else.

427
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,440
I invest in other companies

428
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,510
and hold shares of Hanhai.

429
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
What is the problem?

430
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,110
I'm OK with other companies.

431
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,270
But Hanhai...

432
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,310
Why did you keep it from me?

433
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,790
It was a trade secret

434
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,590
and I couldn't tell you before.

435
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,000
Why on earth did you invest in Xingchen?

436
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,270
To have a smokescreen for Hanhai?

437
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,590
It was you

438
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,480
who needed financing.

439
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,240
Without me,

440
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,680
could Xingchen come this far?

441
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,510
Indeed, you helped Xingchen.

442
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,590
But it's my hard work, too.

443
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,000
I designed the products,

444
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,030
pushed the clinical tests,
and found partner agencies

445
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,480
all by myself!

446
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,750
Xingchen is mine,

447
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,680
not yours.

448
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,830
You have no right to play with it.

449
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,680
How do I play with it?

450
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,750
Did I interfere with its strategy

451
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,680
or did I do anything harmful?

452
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Xingchen's development

453
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,310
does good to me.

454
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,240
Why would I destroy it?

455
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,560
Right.

456
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,920
You don't want to destroy Xingchen

457
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,480
because it develops well enough.

458
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,000
But if it can develop better

459
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,160
just like Hanhai,

460
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,920
you won't leave it uncontrolled, huh?

461
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,590
That's why you want

462
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,160
the merger of Hanhai and Xingchen.

463
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,350
Xing.

464
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,550
A startup without a background

465
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,590
always has a hard time.

466
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,920
Instead of being crushed by a rival,

467
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,000
it's better to be acquired by a big company.

468
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,200
When a small company wants to grow,

469
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,070
its best chance

470
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,750
is to develop fast

471
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,960
on the shoulders of giants.

472
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Hanhai and Xingchen

473
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
are affiliated with Dongyang Medical.

474
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,830
Instead of a useless internal competition,

475
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,310
a favorable integration will be better.

476
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,310
Opportunity and choice

477
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,110
are always more important than hard work.

478
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Far more important.

479
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,480
This is reality.

480
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,070
So, I yielded to reality.

481
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
I chose to rely

482
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,070
on Tongke.

483
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,640
I ripped you off for interest.

484
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,750
Shouldn't you praise me for what I've learned?

485
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,510
You have reasons.

486
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,480
I have my preferences and interests.

487
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,000
I chose Tongke which I preferred.

488
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,350
You can certainly make your choice.

489
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,270
But you need capital first.

490
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Do you have it?

491
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,590
You don't.

492
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,000
I can disapprove of your choice

493
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,000
because I have 33.4%

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,880
of Xingchen's stock.

495
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
You set me up

496
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
just because you knew

497
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,480
I wouldn't give you a hard time.

498
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,550
Have you thought about it?

499
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,510
What if I give you a hard time?

500
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,350
I was living here for a long time

501
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,310
and keeping you company.

502
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,480
I deserve some reward, don't I?

503
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,590
A generous man like you

504
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
will not give me a hard time.

505
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,590
You'll have to stay for a little longer.

506
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,780
(Share Purchase Agreement)

507
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,160
Chang He sold me

508
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,480
his 30% shares of Xingchen.

509
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,160
Now, I hold 53.38%

510
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,200
of Xingchen's stock.

511
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,780
(Party A: Dongyang Medical)
Party B: Tongke Medical)

512
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,110
He...

513
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,800
You...

514
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,880
But you're competitors.

515
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,110
Because I exchanged

516
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,030
something he wanted more

517
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,200
for his shares.

518
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,070
I told you.

519
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
In business, there are no permanent enemies

520
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,590
or permanent friends.

521
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,720
Only the exchange of benefits lasts forever.

522
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,920
Why did you do that?

523
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,440
If you were only worried

524
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,720
that I would usurp Xingchen,

525
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,310
you could have told me.

526
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,350
For our relationship,

527
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,640
would I not give it to you?

528
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,480
What is our relationship?

529
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,750
What on earth do you take me for?

530
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,200
A pet?

531
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
A puppet?

532
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,680
Your concern for me

533
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,030
and your promises... Are they real?

534
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,680
Or is that just a trick

535
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,160
you're good at

536
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,680
and you can do it to any other girl?

537
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,510
Do you think I have so much time

538
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,480
to pamper and cheat you?

539
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,960
You always have poor judgment.

540
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,310
Why did Tongke invest in Xingchen?

541
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,480
Have you thought about it?

542
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,680
Because they want to collude with Han Yuan!

543
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,720
Then they'll crush me!

544
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,880
Han Yuan is using Xingchen

545
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,640
to take back Dongyang Medical.

546
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,240
For interests,

547
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,680
they'll soon sell you.

548
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,720
Can you understand?

549
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,160
You knew

550
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,350
Tongke would do that.

551
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,110
You even wanted them to succeed!

552
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,550
So you could get the evidence

553
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,550
of Han Yuan's leaking information to Chang He.

554
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,190
You got something on her.

555
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,230
To you, Xingchen

556
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,000
is just a pawn!

557
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,760
Pawn?

558
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,030
If it was only a pawn,

559
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,030
why would I try so hard

560
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,760
to get it back from Tongke?

561
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,760
Xing,

562
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,590
as long as you want it,

563
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,550
Xingchen is still yours.

564
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,700
(Party A: Dongyang Medical)
Party B: Tongke Medical)

565
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,590
This is horrible.

566
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,440
Stop telling me

567
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,360
what we have to do

568
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,670
in the business circle.

569
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,320
Stop using such excuses!

570
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,670
In my eyes, you're just hypocritical!

571
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,670
You're indifferent and mercenary!

572
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,550
You're heartless!

573
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,000
Cut it out, Ji Xing!

574
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,110
When we were together,

575
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,880
we could be so happy.

576
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,070
You celebrated my birthday.

577
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,920
You shared your location.

578
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,590
You even used my birthdate

579
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,190
as the password to your door.

580
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,070
You took me to see your family.

581
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,840
I...

582
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,240
You...

583
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,070
I thought you adored me

584
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,670
and then I fell in love with you.

585
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,760
Or I wouldn't have loved you!

586
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,510
I indeed adore you.

587
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,710
You're just a liar.

588
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,070
You're nice to me

589
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,360
just because I'm right for you, huh?

590
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,200
Liar!

591
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,190
- Listen.
- Stay away! Don't touch me!

592
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,680
- Listen, Ji Xing.
- I don't want to listen!

593
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,110
I just don't! Don't touch me!

594
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,230
You're terrible.

595
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,400
Really terrible.

596
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,880
(Dongyang Group)
Dongyang Medical announced

597
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,510
that they held shares of Hanhai Technology.

598
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,320
To such great news of Dongyang Medical,

599
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,190
the market reacted immediately.

600
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,070
The stock price of Dongyang Medical rocketed

601
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,920
(Honeycomb News)
and hit an all-time high.

602
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,320
Dongyang Medical vigorously develops

603
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,700
3D medical printing.

604
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,020
After investing in Xingchen Technology,

605
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,110
a cutting-edge startup,

606
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,440
Dongyang Medical holds shares

607
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,280
of the leading company, Hanhai Technology.

608
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,280
It's spreading tracks in business.

609
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,920
It's reported that Dongyang Medical

610
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,120
will integrate Hanhai and Xingchen.

611

(Dongyang Group)

612
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,280
Mr. Chen, long time no see.

613
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,210
Yeah.

614
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,190
But in the future,

615
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,190
we will often meet.

616
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
I look forward

617
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,110
to more communication with you.

618
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,840
Actually, Xingchen used to take Hanhai

619
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,670
as its strongest rival.

620
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Unexpectedly,

621
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,510
we have the same investor.

622
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,550
Mr. Chen, did you know it a long time ago?

623
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,360
Miss Ji,

624
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,280
I'm not having

625
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,920
social pleasantries

626
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,550
just because we have

627
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,400
the same investor.

628
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,280
From the bottom of my heart,

629
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,400
I appreciate Xingchen's products

630
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,480
and corporate culture.

631
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,150
I admire you, too.

632
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,710
In your previous speech, you said

633
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,800
you would do your best

634
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,230
to make a difference

635
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,480
for ordinary people.

636
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,510
I've kept that in mind.

637
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
Thanks.

638
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,800
Actually, I invited you here

639
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,150
to talk with you

640
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,280
about the merger of our companies.

641
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,920
But Miss Ji, why don't you

642
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,070
just talk to Mr. Han?

643
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Because you're in charge.

644
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,360
I want to tell you

645
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
about my requirements

646
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,150
so that I can appease my employees.

647
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
I understand.

648
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,190
Actually,

649
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,880
I proposed to Mr. Han

650
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,400
about the merge of Xingchen.

651
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,280
But he rejected me.

652
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,670
Later, when he brought it up again,

653
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,800
he emphasized

654
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,480
Hanhai would not merge Xingchen,

655
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,760
but have an organic integration.

656
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,360
If you have any requirements,

657
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,480
feel free to let me know.

658
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,360
I'll be sure to tell Mr. Han.

659
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,360
I have only two requirements.

660
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,390
First,

661
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,920
after the merger,

662
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,070
you must not fire my employees
unless they make a mistake.

663
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,640
Second,

664
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,150
retain Xingchen's right of independent R&amp;D.

665
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,920
OK.

666
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,710
Miss Ji, please give me some time.

667
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,550
I'll talk to Mr. Han.

668
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,110
OK. I'll wait for your reply.

669
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
No problem.

670
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,070
I'll go up, then.

671
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,910
OK. I'll let you work.

672
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,640
Mr. Han,

673
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,880
Miss Ji had two requirements.

674
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,150
If you approve,

675
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,920
I'll put them in the merger proposal.

676
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,340
(Merger Proposal of Hanhai and Xingchen)

677
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,150
She had only two requirements?

678
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
Yes.

679
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,550
Miss Ji looked calm.

680
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,280
This is a business strategy.

681
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,110
You also considered what was best for Xingchen.

682
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,510
I believe Miss Ji will understand.

683
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,920
Don't worry about the merger.

684
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,760
I'll take care of it.

685
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
I talked to Mr. Chen of Hanhai.

686
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,710
He will reply.

687
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,920
Are you OK?

688
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,360
Mr. Han...

689
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,510
Mr. Han has his considerations.

690
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,800
The three of us will
just take care of Xingchen.

691
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,550
OK.

692
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,470
Xing,

693
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:57,670
we all listen to you.

694
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,640
(Chen Ningyang)
Miss Ji,

695
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,550
Mr. Han approved your requirements.

696
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,840
The merger proposal
will be emailed to you later.

697
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,320
Get everybody to a meeting.

698
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Miss Ji,

699
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,480
is the news true?

700
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,360
This is what I'm going to tell you now.

701
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,070
Hanhai and Xingchen

702
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,880
will be merged.

703
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Really?

704
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,840
Miss Ji,

705
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,400
what do we do?

706
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,840
After the merger with Hanhai,

707
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,400
will we be fired or replaced?

708
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,320
I know what you're worried about.

709
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,000
I talked to Mr. Chen of Hanhai.

710
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,070
He revised

711
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,960
the merger proposal.

712
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,190
Mr. Han approved it, too.

713
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,000
First, Hanhai Xingchen

714
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
will not fire our employees
unless you make a mistake.

715
00:41:59,070 --> 00:41:59,920
Second,

716
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,320
Xingchen's right

717
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,670
of independent R&amp;D will be retained.

718
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,590
You'll still work in this place.

719
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,800
After the merger,

720
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,150
you'll share the welfare and right

721
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,990
as you have now.

722
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,800
Actually, the merger isn't a bad thing.

723
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,070
Hanhai started five years

724
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,320
earlier than us.

725
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,590
Their materials and research results

726
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,280
are more exhaustive than ours.

727
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,400
They're strong and powerful.

728
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,030
I believe talents like you guys

729
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,000
will have a bigger stage

730
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,960
after the merger.

731
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,710
It's an opportunity and a challenge.

732
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:39,950
Xing,

733
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
what are we going to do next?

734
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,230
Next, you will

735
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,070
go over your work at hand

736
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,760
and get ready for the merger.

737
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,480
Their guys will be sent for the takeover.

738
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
As long as you guys stay,

739
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,400
Xingchen will not fall apart.

740
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,160
Miss Ji,

741
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,280
after the merger,

742
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,190
