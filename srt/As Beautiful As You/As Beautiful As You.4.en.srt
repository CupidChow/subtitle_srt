00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,450
I'm fine.

26
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,480
Thank you, young girl.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
Why is it so hard to have a dental check?

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,530
It took me two hours to get here.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,200
But my trip will be wasted.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,010
What do I do?

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
Oh...

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
Director Li,

34
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,250
the Doctorcloud broke down.

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,720
May I check it?

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Miss Ji,

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,370
you're a maintenance engineer

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,720
for Robot Bay.

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,120
Doctorcloud is quite complicated.

40
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,210
Can you handle it?

41
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,050
It's a mess out there.

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,720
Why don't you let me try?

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,440
It can't get worse, anyway.

44
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,370
Fine. You try it.

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
Come on. Give your seat to Miss Ji.

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
Now, you can restart

53
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,600
all the computers.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
OK.

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,160
Oh, Engineer Ji,

56
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,370
thank you so much.

57
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,770
You're indeed

58
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,810
the best engineer in Guanghua.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,800
So professional.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,890
All the products and engineers

61
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,480
of Dongyang Group are professional.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,250
I'm just an ordinary one.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,770
You're not ordinary.

64
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,800
Today, our system

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,010
had such a big failure.

66
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,330
Luckily, you were here to help.

67
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,040
Then will you consider

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,690
the cooperation on Bay Phase II?

69
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
Let me get it straight.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,530
Your Robot Bay

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,370
is actually a mission

72
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,770
to doctors like us.

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
In terms of test

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
and primary diagnosis,

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,800
Bay does a good job.

76
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,480
But after the diagnosis,

77
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
the patients want doctors

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,400
to recheck them.

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
For a general hospital like us,

80
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,730
it's more complicated.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
But anyway, your robot

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,770
is really good.

83
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,480
It gives professional diagnoses, too.

84
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,210
I see your point.

85
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,920
Think about this.

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
If we promote this robot

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,040
to primary hospitals

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,160
and township clinics

89
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,240
with poor medical resources,

90
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,770
will it work better?

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,530
It's a good idea.

92
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,530
Director Li.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,160
- Mr. Han.
- Mr. Han.

94
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,280
Today, we barely had a big problem.

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
Luckily, Miss Ji has been here.

96
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,920
She solved the problem immediately.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,650
If the failure lasted longer

98
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,720
and led to media exposure,

99
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,650
or some patients made trouble

100
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,690
and we were blamed,

101
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,530
it would harm both sides.

102
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,570
Sorry for the trouble.

103
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,480
Later, Dr. Jiang Huai's team

104
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,400
will fully upgrade

105
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,720
and inspect the system

106
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,210
to completely fix the bugs.

107
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Nothing like this

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,320
will happen again.

109
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,160
Hearing this, Mr. Han,

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,240
I'll be relieved.

111
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,610
Mr. Han,

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,650
today's bug problem

113
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,600
doesn't look like an accident.

114
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,480
I saw a man

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
precisely say out

116
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,010
the Doctorcloud of Dongyang Medical.

117
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,400
Why do you apply the new system?

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,650
Doctorcloud, huh?

119
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,210
From Dongyang Medical.

120
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,090
That's a big company.

121
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,480
Such a scam.

122
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,720
When it's poorly maintained,
you'd better not use it.

123
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,360
You even hold the patients up.

124
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,530
This isn't over.

125
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,600
I can't photograph, huh?

126
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,570
When can we see a doctor?

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,720
What a poor system!

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
And some men

129
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,650
snap random shots.

130
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,650
Would you like to investigate it?

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
Thank you for today.

132
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,280
You're welcome.

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,970
Think of it as my repaying your previous help.

134
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,330
Compared

135
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,720
with my little help,

136
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
I've taken advantage.

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
(Smile)
A reporter had

138
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,890
a press release of the Doctorcloud.

139
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm afraid this isn't an accident.

140
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,920
Luckily, the system problem

141
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,480
was solved in time.

142
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,290
Otherwise,

143
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,130
it would affect the use of Doctorcloud

144
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,040
in other hospitals.

145
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Anyway, I owe you this.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,800
I just debugged it for the emergency.

147
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,920
It can barely keep the existing system.

148
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,890
It should be upgraded as soon as possible

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,800
in case of further trouble.

150
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,010
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

151
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,120
Get in the car.

152
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,690
I can go alone, Mr. Han.

153
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,530
To avoid me in case they gossip?

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,890
You also saw the post on the intranet?

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,770
I guessed it.

156
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,240
What?

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,970
Can't bear the grievance??

158
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,610
That's not true.

159
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,010
Ji Xing,

160
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,160
don't care about what others think.

161
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,720
A chained eagle

162
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,240
can't roar up into the sky.

163
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Be what you want to do.

164
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,450
Don't let others define you.

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,770
Young girl.

166
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,240
May I borrow your phone?

167
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,720
My son

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
asked me to call him back

169
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,650
after the dental check.

170
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,600
But my phone is dead.

171
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,040
It's OK. You can use mine.

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Here, just dial.

173
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,040
OK. Thanks.

174
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,520
Hey, son.

175
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,330
I'm done with the dental check.

176
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,600
I won't miss the shuttle.

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes. I'll be back soon.

178
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,530
I'll say no more.

179
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,930
My phone is dead.

180
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,520
I borrowed this from a girl.

181
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,840
I have to return it.

182
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,360
I'll hang up. OK.

183
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Thank you very much.

184
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
You're welcome.

185
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,170
Just now,

186
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,360
did you solve that problem?

187
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,210
It's so nice.

188
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,330
Thank you so much.

189
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,570
Without you, we would have come for nothing.

190
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,720
You're welcome.

191
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,930
It's just my job.

192
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Young guys like you are always modest.

193
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,880
Well, I should go.

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
OK.

195
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,090
When you have time,

196
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,290
come to our Qingtian Fishing Village for fun.

197
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,840
Our village is beautiful.

198
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,680
OK. OK.

199
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,090
- Bye.
- Bye. Be careful.

200
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,930
Thank you.

201
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,360
Not at all. Be careful.

202
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,290
I will.

203
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
I didn't see that coming.

204
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,090
I sent her to Xinggang Hospital

205
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,120
and she even helped Mr. Han.

206
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,930
We can at least tell

207
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,210
Ji Xing is really capable.

208
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,290
She helped Dongyang Medical

209
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,570
to debug Doctorcloud.

210
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
She won an honor for our company.

211
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,410
What if she failed?

212
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,050
If the cooperation

213
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,570
between them was affected

214
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,330
and things went worse,

215
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,480
who would be responsible?

216
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,970
You or me?

217
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,000
You're right.

218
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,360
I should have been more thoughtful.

219
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,720
Ji Xing was too brash.

220
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,250
Songlin.

221
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,050
Sometimes it's a good thing

222
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,120
when your subordinate

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,520
is ambitious.

224
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,360
But if she gets promoted too quickly,

225
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,840
she's very likely

226
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,050
to threaten your position.

227
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,050
I get it.

228
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,290
I'll go teach her a lesson.

229
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,730
Ji Xing,

230
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,170
are you done with Xinggang Hospital?

231
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,000
I have something to tell you.

232
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,890
Come with me.

233
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,720
Doctorcloud will

234
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,050
work with Bay

235
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,410
on grass-roots diagnosis.

236
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,240
I've signed up for you.

237
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,880
Isn't it the job of the Marketing Department?

238
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Why do I have to go?

239
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,170
Ji Xing,

240
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,810
I know

241
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,760
you think it's hard work

242
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,840
to do a grass-roots mission.

243
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,880
But the harder the work is,

244
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,050
the more it presents

245
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,810
your effort and responsibility.

246
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,250
Do a good job

247
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,450
and satisfy the superiors.

248
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,650
Then,

249
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,450
I may get another chance

250
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,290
to apply for your promotion thing.

251
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,450
You promised to apply for that

252
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,640
after Bay Phase I is over.

253
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,410
Why would you get another chance?

254
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Ji Xing,

255
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,970
I was about to tell you about this.

256
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,210
I had planned

257
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,480
to talk to the HR director after the New Year

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
about your promotion thing.

259
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,120
But think about what you did.

260
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,520
You made a big scene.

261
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,640
Everybody then complains.

262
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,810
You know.

263
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,210
In some cases, I'm not the one

264
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,050
calling the shots alone.

265
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,170
I was trying hard for that, too.

266
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,600
But now it seems

267
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,240
you're not likely to get promoted.

268
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,520
The project bonus for Bay

269
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,050
may be reduced, too.

270
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,330
By what degree?

271
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,840
Well, I'm not sure.

272
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,640
What you did

273
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,810
has made everybody complain.

274
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,090
To calm them down,

275
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,690
we have to sacrifice you.

276
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,640
Why?

277
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,170
What do they complain about?

278
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm the victim.

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,690
And Director Chen,

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,240
are you sure I can't get promoted

281
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
simply for what happened at the party?

282
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
Come on.

283
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,520
What are you talking about?

284
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,840
You painted the biggest rosy picture,

285
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,330
gave me the hardest work,

286
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,930
and put in a good word for me

287
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,770
to the HR director

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,170
so that I couldn't get promoted.

289
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,010
I heard that.

290
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,410
What?

291
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,770
Come on, Ji Xing.

292
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Who did you

293
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
hear all this from?

294
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,690
Come on, Ji Xing. Calm down.

295
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,290
You have to know. In some cases,

296
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,970
I have no choice, either.

297
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,970
OK. Since you can't call the shots,

298
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,760
I'll go ask someone who can do it.

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, you...

300
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,200
You...

301
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,520
Email me an electronic copy.

302
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,520
OK. If you don't mind,

303
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,360
I should go, Miss Zeng.

304
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
What's up?

305
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,290
Miss Zeng,

306
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,170
I have a question.

307
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,970
I work for the R&amp;D Department.

308
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,810
Why do I have to do the work

309
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,170
of the Marketing and Maintenance Departments.

310
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,760
It's Director Chen's decision after talking

311
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,840
to the HR Department.

312
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,640
You ask me?

313
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,240
Isn't it inappropriate?

314
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,090
Sorry. I know I went over his head.

315
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,330
But Director Chen said
he couldn't call the shots.

316
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,450
So, I came to you.

317
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,210
Since I came here,

318
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,930
I've been working on Bay.

319
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,930
I'm deeply engaged in work.

320
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,290
I have affections

321
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,210
for this project,

322
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,410
but I need to live.

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,720
Director Chen promised

324
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,690
to apply for my promotion

325
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,450
after Bay Phase I was over but regretted it.

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The promised bonus was reduced, too.

327
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,970
If you want me to do other work,

328
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,520
it's OK. No problem.

329
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,320
But

330
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,240
without a suitable pay,

331
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,930
I think it's a little unfair.

332
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,170
Ji Xing,

333
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,090
if you hold a grudge against Chen Songlin

334
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,120
because he defended Zhu Lei,

335
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,930
you're being narrow-minded.

336
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,810
Besides, Zhu Lei

337
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,000
paid his price.

338
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,970
You shouldn't blame anyone else.

339
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
I believe Director Chen

340
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
has made this decision

341
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,760
for some reason.

342
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,410
If I meddle rashly,

343
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,360
how will he manage the R&amp;D Department?

344
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
That's not true, Miss Zeng.

345
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
Ji Xing.

346
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,600
I know you're outstanding.

347
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,690
But we offered you space for career growth.

348
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,090
I want you

349
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,240
to take the long view.

350
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,760
You should know.

351
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,600
Not every company

352
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
can allow you to do what you want.

353
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,520
I have a teleconference.

354
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,090
(To calm them down,)

355
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,720
(we have to sacrifice you.)

356
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,810
(Not every company)

357
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,970
(can allow you to do what you want.)

358
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,480
It's done.

359
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,530
Ji Xing,

360
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,970
email me the proposal for Phase II

361
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,810
you've compiled.

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,840
Ji Xing,

363
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,520
you're the subordinate

364
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,880
I've valued most.

365
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,210
If I said something

366
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,120
that confused you,

367
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,170
don't take it personally.

368
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,570
You and I are in the same boat.

369
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,720
When Bay develops well,

370
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,240
we'll both get promoted.

371
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,410
Bay is your hard work.

372
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,240
A responsible guy like you

373
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,000
will not give up halfway.

374
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Ji Xing,

375
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,450
you're still young.

376
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,450
There will be a lot of opportunities.

377
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,280
But what if you offend Miss Zeng

378
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,240
for such a small thing?

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
You'd lose more.

380
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,370
Do you know
how hard it is to get a job?

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,610
Once a technical guy like you

382
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,720
can't be admitted

383
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,690
to the core project team,

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
the discontinuity in experience and ability

385
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,930
will ruin your career.

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,410
I've been there, girl.

387
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,450
I'm saying this for your own good.

388
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,930
Come on. Stop being angry.

389
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,280
Email me the proposal

390
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,520
you've compiled.

391
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,020
(Send, Theme: Proposal of Dr. Bay Phase II)

392
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,520
I've emailed the proposal.

393
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,290
OK.

394
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,410
I quit.

395
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,160
Qu...

396
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,890
Quit?

397
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,210
Ji Xing, think carefully about it.

398
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,450
When you started your job,

399
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,890
you signed the noncompete agreement.

400
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,480
Once you resign,

401
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,560
in the next two years,

402
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
you can't work in this industry.

403
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Later, I'll email you

404
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,120
my resignation.

405
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,210
OK. Even if you resign,

406
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,370
you'll have one month

407
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,210
for the handover.

408
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,450
You must finish

409
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,610
what you're working on.

410
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,970
You must obey the work arrangements

411
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,170
and be always on call.

412
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,080
Miss Ji is...

413
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
She has resigned, I think.

414
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,130
You offered to recruit Miss Ji

415
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,370
to Dr. Jiang's team.

416
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,800
Shall we have our HR contact her?

417
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,210
Send her resume to Dr. Jiang.

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,840
OK.

419
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,080
Yichen, I quit my job.

420
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Did they bully you?

421
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,760
No. I just didn't want the job.

422
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,560
The project bonus is gone.

423
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
Our flat plan has to be put off.

424
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,480
Silly girl,

425
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,800
instead of buying a flat,

426
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,690
(Dongyang Group)
I want you to be happy.

427
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,370
It's OK you resigned.

428
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
Xing,

429
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,760
when you don't want this job,

430
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
quit it.

431
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,890
It's just nothing.

432
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,650
I've just realized

433
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,130
humans are more complicated than codes.

434
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,360
Promise me.

435
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,690
Don't think of anything these days.

436
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,930
Take a good rest and relax.

437
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,720
When I'm done working,

438
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
I'll get back to you immediately.

439
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,320
OK?

440
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,880
Bye-bye.

441
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,540
(Dongyang Group)

442
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
Yichen.

443
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,360
Still working?

444
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,530
Come on.

445
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,130
Why are you having instant noodles?

446
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,560
Director Liu invited us to a big dinner.

447
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,560
Let's go.

448
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,800
I'll be full.

449
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,640
You go have dinner.

450
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,170
Today, I'll prepare all the materials

451
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,040
for the seminar.

452
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,690
When the seminar is over,

453
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,970
I'll be able to submit

454
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,810
the summary report.

455
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,800
This report isn't urgent.

456
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
After the seminar,

457
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,320
we can take our time to write.

458
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,410
Besides,

459
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,690
didn't we make a deal?

460
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,930
We'll travel around before we go back home.

461
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,040
Maybe next time. When the seminar is over,

462
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm going back to Xinggang.

463
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,690
Miss your girlfriend, huh?

464
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Fine. I won't bother you.

465
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,170
Call me if you need anything.

466
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
Enjoy your dinner.

467
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,450
Gentleman, the diamond ring you picked

468
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,970
has a fantastic name,

469
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,520
Starry Love.

470
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,280
It symbolizes the deepest love.

471
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,290
Xing,

472
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
wait for me.

473
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,900
(Shao Yichen: Xing, wait for me.)

474
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,850
It's ten. Why haven't you gone to work?

475
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,690
I quit my job.

476
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
You did?

477
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,970
All of a sudden. You resigned?

478
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,170
What a silly girl!

479
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,370
Then you can't get the compensation.

480
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,450
More than that.

481
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,320
The year-end bonus and project bonus

482
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,210
are gone, too.

483
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,560
Is Shao Yichen aware?

484
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes.

485
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,610
I'm just doing what he asked me to,

486
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,170
rest and relax.

487
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,650
You keep saying you want to wake up naturally.

488
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,450
Now, you can sleep late without worry.

489
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Will you get back to sleep?

490
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,040
My body clock is set.

491
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,850
I can't sleep now.

492
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm OK. Don't worry.

493
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,800
I'll just sit and think of nothing.

494
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,520
(Su Zhizhou)
Xing, I modified the proposal again.

495
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
When are you available this week?

496
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,600
I'll come to you.

497
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,930
Now. I'm available now.

498
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,240
We can meet now.

499
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,170
Right now.

500
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,850
Here's your coffee.

501
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,010
Careful it's hot.

502
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,760
Come on. Cheers.

503
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,850
You're so happy to know I resigned.

504
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,930
I am, of course.

505
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,810
Xing,

506
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,080
do some thinking

507
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,560
about our entrepreneurship.

508
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,080
3D medical printing

509
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,210
has a very good prospect.

510
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,890
It's for all the patients, too.

511
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,650
My head is still spinning.

512
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,610
I won't think about work for now.

513
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,290
I get it.

514
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,650
Xing.

515
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,610
I don't know

516
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,890
what happened to you.

517
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,370
But I can feel

518
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,240
this resignation

519
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,320
upsets you a lot.

520
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,130
Then why do you have to get stuck?

521
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,210
Think about it.

522
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,800
When we were in college,

523
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,970
you used to be unrestrained and dazzling.

524
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,000
I have to take this.

525
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,520
Hello.

526
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,760
Young girl,

527
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,810
it's me.

528
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,930
In Xinggang Hospital,

529
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,770
we met.

530
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,520
I even borrowed your phone

531
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,240
to call my son.

532
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,410
You remember me, huh?

533
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,080
Oh, Granny. Hello.

534
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
What do you want me for?

535
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,610
I want to ask you something.

536
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,800
Since last time

537
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,170
I had the dental check,

538
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,130
I've been taking the medicine.

539
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
But these days, I have a toothache again.

540
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,970
Our Qingtian Fishing Village

541
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,690
is too far away from the hospital.

542
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,650
I want to ask you what I should do.

543
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,650
To keep taking some medicine

544
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,610
or go to the hospital again?

545
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Well, Granny,

546
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm not a doctor.

547
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm not sure about that.

548
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,650
You'd better go to the hospital.

549
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,970
You're not a doctor?

550
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,240
In the hospital,

551
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,890
I saw you fix that system.

552
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,800
I thought you were

553
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,280
a doctor there.

554
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,760
I'll wait for a day or two, then.

555
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,080
If it still hurts,

556
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,040
I'll take the shuffle to the hospital.

557
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,370
I'll leave you alone, young girl.

558
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,450
It's OK.

559
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,360
Goodbye.

560
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,970
Who's that, Xing?

561
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,800
In Xinggang Hospital,

562
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,970
I met a granny.

563
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,800
She thought I was a doctor.

564
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,280
She lives in a fishing village

565
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,690
far away from here.

566
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,610
It takes her great trouble

567
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,080
to have a dental check in the hospital.

568
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,280
Indeed. Medical conditions in villages

569
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,210
can be even worse.

570
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,450
Life is hard for those old people.

571
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Let's get to your business.

572
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,170
Show me your proposal.

573
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,450
Here.

574
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,930
Please take a look.

575
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,280
It has a cover now.

576
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,930
Everyone makes progress, huh?

577
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,890
The two of you are so busy

578
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,450
that I can hardly see you.

579
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,410
Especially Xing.

580
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,240
She keeps busy when she's quit her job.

581
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,400
She always runs out.

582
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,720
I'll stop after handing over my work.

583
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,120
Sweetheart,

584
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,080
my big client's company

585
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,850
is recruiting a software engineer.

586
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,560
How about I recommend you?

587
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,720
A junior brother of mine

588
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,080
invited me to start up a business with him.

589
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,480
I really admire him.

590
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,370
He's brave and decisive.

591
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,650
What he said

592
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,760
has actually impressed me.

593
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,280
Are you insane?

594
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,130
How much money is needed for that?

595
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,490
Yeah.

596
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,450
It's really hard to start up a business.

597
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,040
But I don't know

598
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,370
what I should do.

599
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,130
If I go to a new company,

600
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,690
work for two or three years,

601
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,970
and meet something terrible again,

602
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,890
life will end up the same way.

603
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,240
Never mind. Let's not talk about this.

604
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,120
Enjoy the food.

605
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,450
Just don't think about it.

606
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,620
(Notice: Business trip
to Qingtian Fishing Village)

607
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,690
Qingtian Fishing Village?

608
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,160
What village?

609
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,800
Guanghua's activity to assist doctors

610
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,610
in grass-roots units.

611
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,130
Qingtian Fishing Village, come on.

612
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,370
But you resigned.

613
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,410
Why are you still sent? Don't go.

614
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,650
Obviously, it's a job that nobody wants.

615
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,970
It's very bad of your superior.

616
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,690
But I hear

617
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,320
Qingtian Fishing Village is beautiful.

618
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,930
How about we travel there?

619
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,530
OK.

620
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,280
Let's take Xing there for some fresh air.

621
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,970
What can we do there?

622
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,040
Let me check.

623
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,240
We can catch crabs.

624
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,560
We can also take a speedboat for sea fishing.

625
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,240
It's very far, though.

626
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,080
(Yuanshan Station)
We'll take Subway No.4,

627
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,760
Bus No.915,

628
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,850
and then Bus No.309.

629
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,560
It'll take about two hours.

630
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,560
That's too far.

631
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,400
I'm not going.

632
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,890
We have to transfer like that?

633
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,080
We don't need to.

634
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,890
Li has a car.

635
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,160
Right?

636
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,320
With a traffic jam at the weekend,

637
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
it'll take a longer time.

638
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,320
Pick another place.

639
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,450
Somewhere closer.

640
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,970
Rural tourism, for example.

641
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,240
Come on, Li.

642
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,040
Look, I'll prepare some snacks.

643
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,450
When you're tired from driving,

644
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,650
I'll sing for you

645
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,560
and give you a massage.

646
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,450
Boss, these are the locations and schedules

647
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,760
for the joint grass-roots research

648
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,890
of Doctorcloud and Bay.

649
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,940
(Qingtian Fishing Village, Ji Xing)

650
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,610
Qingtian Fishing Village...

651
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,770
I'm going there, too.

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,850
I'll have it arranged.

653
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,260
(Pick-up Point of Qingtian Fishing Village)

654
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,780
(Donglin, Qingtian Fishing Village, Haizhou)

655
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,760
I've just arrived.

656
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,850
I just got off the shuttle.

657
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,370
Have the devices arrived?

658
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,410
OK. Send me the location

659
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,410
of the clinic.

660
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,250
Bye.

661
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,850
Mr. Han?

662
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,930
You don't need the location.

663
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,770
I'll take you there.

664
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,450
Coming to this project

665
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,610
even when you've resigned?

666
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,240
I gave my word.

667
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,930
I'll do my duty in the last few days.

668
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,850
Dr. Jiang will take over

669
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,170
the AI Department of Dongyang Medical,

670
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,480
in charge of the research

671
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,720
and operation of Doctorcloud.

672
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,410
You have Dr. Jiang in charge.

673
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
Impressive, Mr. Han.

674
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,970
Join Dongyang Medical.

675
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,850
He knew you helped

676
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,210
to debug Doctorcloud

677
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,850
and asked me for your resume.

678
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,760
He wants you

679
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,600
to join his team.

680
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,930
I can't. I signed the noncompete agreement.

681
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,170
I can make it invalid.

682
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,170
Feel free to ask for a pay.

683
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,040
It'll be higher than that in Guanghua.

684
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,690
If you request something more,

685
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:31,810
let me know.

686
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,610
Old schoolmate, thank you

687
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,720
for inviting me.

688
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,610
But under such circumstances...

689
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,850
What circumstances?

690
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm confused and self-doubting.

691
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,650
You think what you get isn't proportional

692
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,760
to what you give, huh?

693
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,720
Mr. Han, can you read minds?

694
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,930
I always think

695
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,850
what I take and what I give

696
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,970
should be proportional.

697
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,480
But now I've realized

698
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,610
traditional codes of conduct matter more

699
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,240
than professional skills.

700
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,800
You've just realized it?

701
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,930
You work on AI.

702
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,480
Even a robot has to keep learning

703
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,560
and adapt to the environment
in case of being replaced.

704
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,690
Why do you still need

705
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,970
to be enlightened?

706
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,450
You have a point.

707
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,720
But I just don't want to be assimilated

708
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,450
or become someone like that.

709
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
To avoid being assimilated,

710
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,760
the simplest way is

711
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,650
find the group

712
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,610
you fully agree with.

713
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,280
Just like you, Dr. Jiang

714
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,170
is a technical guy

715
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,650
who doesn't care for worldly wisdom.

716
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,040
Maybe two stubborn guys like you

717
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,930
will make a big difference.

718
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,930
Under such circumstances,

719
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,320
working with Dr. Jiang

720
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,650
will be your best choice.

721
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,610
Think about it.

722
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,210
It's OK. Take this

723
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,370
and line up over there.

724
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560
OK. Thanks.

725
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,970
Hello, guys.

726
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,720
This is the charity medicine

727
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,850
of Guanghua Technology.

728
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,600
Here's an introduction.

729
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,250
(Charity Medicine of Dongyang Medical)
If you want

730
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,610
(and Guanghua Technology)
a dental check,

731
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,600
you can line up over there.

732
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,810
It's free of charge.

733
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,330
- Let's go have a look.
- Come on.

734
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,680
Oh, it's you, young girl.

735
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,410
- Hi, Granny.
- Hi.

736
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,370
Didn't you say you weren't a doctor?

737
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,930
I'm not a doctor.

738
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,520
Look at that white machine.

739
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,450
It's Robot Bay.

740
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm the engineer of Bay.

741
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,520
I came with it to give dental checks.

742
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,450
What about your teeth? Any better?

743
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,810
Would like to have a check?

744
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,930
No, thanks.

745
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,250
I called you

746
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,640
because I was too impatient.

747
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,040
I took some medicine and it was OK.

748
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,480
That robot

749
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,970
was invented by you?

750
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,200
I'm involved in its design and development.

751
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,560
So, you can say that.

752
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,850
This is great.

753
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,410
Finally, we don't need to go

754
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,410
such a long way to the hospital.

755
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,770
This is my old friend,

756
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,250
Niu Yuhong.

757
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,850
- Hi, Granny
- Hi.

758
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,080
These days, she feels
something wrong inside her mouth.

759
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,520
Instead of seeing a doctor,
she takes casual medicine.

760
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,120
Can this little robot

761
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,450
give her a check?

762
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,450
Yes.

763
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,160
Granny, this is for you.

764
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,480
You take one and I'll take you to the queue.

765
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,770
- Let's go.
- Oh, don't.

766
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,000
I can walk by myself.

767
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,560
OK. Come with me, then.

768
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,810
Granny Niu.

769
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,000
Nice to meet you.

770
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,810
According to the report,

771
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,600
at the side of the first left molar,

772
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,410
some of the gums are swollen.

773
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,410
This is it.

774
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,450
A deep periodontal pocket.

775
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,560
Inside it,

776
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,970
some purulent fluid is out.

777
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,930
Luckily, you had it checked today.

778
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,600
If you let the inflammation continue,

779
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,450
it will lead

780
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
to the absorption of alveolar bone.

781
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,770
That is to say, you'll lose this tooth.

782
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,040
What can she do?

783
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah. What can I do?

784
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,930
You need

785
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,160
ultrasonic scaling.

786
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,640
We'll do the sub-gingival scaling

787
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,040
before polishing the surface

788
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,930
of your tooth.

789
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,200
Then with some medicine,

790
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,600
we'll do local irrigation.

791
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,930
So much trouble?

792
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,040
Not really.

793
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,680
Well, I'll give you some anti-inflammatories.

794
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,850
- Hi, Chief.
- Hi, Chief.

795
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,970
Hello, kids.

796
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,730
Mr. Han, don't worry.

797
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,160
Our clinic

798
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,160
will make good use

799
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,250
of Doctorcloud.

800
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,970
Thanks for your cooperation.

801
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,930
We should thank you.

802
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,600
This medical system

803
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,120
is of great help

804
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,970
to this remote village.

805
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,580
(Metronidazole and Fenbufen Capsules)

806
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,540
(Diagnostic Report)

807
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,410
Granny, you've kept in mind

808
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,520
what the doctor said, huh?

809
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,600
Don't worry. The ultrasonic scaling

810
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
is very convenient.

811
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,080
This is your diagnostic report.

812
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,930
Take it.

813
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,160
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

814
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,570
What happened?

815
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,120
Be careful.

816
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,930
Don't help me. Don't.

817
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,810
I can walk by myself.

818
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,370
Oh, Yuhong.

819
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,200
When she was young,

820
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,410
her calf was cut off by a car.

821
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,770
She's using an artificial calf.

822
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,930
She has such strong self-esteem

823
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,520
that she lets no one help her.

824
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,480
Never mind.

825
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,370
I won't.

826
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,520
Are you leaving tonight?

827
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,850
Tomorrow, actually.

828
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
Then live in my house tonight.

829
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,250
Don't bother, Granny.

830
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,410
Our company has arrangements.

831
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,810
The guesthouse at the village entrance.

832
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,520
OK. I'll let you work. I should go.

833
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
Let me walk you back.

834
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,210
No need.

835
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,360
You get back to work.

836
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,730
Yuhong.

837
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,370
It's a good day, huh? You had a check.

838
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,770
What shall I do?

839
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,370
See the doctor and take the medicine.

840
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,640
Just listen to the doctor.

841
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,480
Take it and you'll be fine.

842
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,330
This system feels like

843
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,120
a professional doctor

844
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,970
from a big hospital

845
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,120
is sent to our clinic.

846
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,970
Glad it can help you.

847
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,770
When you have any problem later,

848
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,560
feel free to contact our engineers.

849
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,160
OK.

850
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,680
You get back to work. I'll walk around.

851
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,170
What are you thinking?

852
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,250
When I see the robot I make

853
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,560
can be of great help,

854
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,370
I get a sense of achievement.

855
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,440
That's right.

856
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,040
I'll get to work.

857
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,450
Don't eat sour or spicy food.

858
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,600
Pay attention

859
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,850
to oral hygiene, OK?

860
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,040
I'd like to thank the committee

861
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,560
(AI Creative Competition)
for approving the medical robot we've designed.

862
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,410
Now, it is only a crude prototype.

863
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,600
But we'll keep improving it

864
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,410
until it's put into use

865
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,680
to help more people in need.

866
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,690
Granny Liu.

867
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,480
- Girl.
- What are you doing here?

868
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,290
I'm here for you.

869
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,290
Yuhong made this dried fish.

870
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,370
It's delicious.

871
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,080
She asked me to bring you some.

872
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,890
No, thanks. It's so nice of you.

873
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,970
It's not something expensive.

874
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,930
If you don't accept it, she'll be sad.

875
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,640
- Fine, then.
- Here.

876
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,480
Come over and sit.

877
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,400
OK.

878
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,810
Be seated, please.

879
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Where's Granny Niu?

880
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,970
She doesn't usually go out unless she has to.

881
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,160
Oh, does her artificial calf

882
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,730
not match her body?

883
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,890
I see her walk uncomfortably.

884
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah.

885
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,200
She was injured many years ago.

886
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,250
The artificial calf she wears

887
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,080
is a ready-made one.

888
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,330
When she felt uncomfortable,

889
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,730
she consulted a doctor.

890
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,040
The doctor suggests

891
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,120
she should have one customized

892
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,370
based on her own calf.

893
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,040
How much does it cost?

894
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,640
We're not sure.

895
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,330
We just know a customized calf costs

896
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,370
as much as a flat in the city.

897
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,480
How can she afford it?

898
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,290
You have no idea.

899
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,890
When her knee

900
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,080
was in a serious condition,

901
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,160
it bled really a lot.

902
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,680
I feel so sorry for her.

903
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,250
She used to be very outgoing

904
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,850
and beautiful.

905
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,520
Because of her calf,

906
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,480
she's been living all alone

907
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,970
and her life is wasted.

908
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,290
Granny, don't worry.

909
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,600
Our medical skills

910
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,890
have been developing very fast.

911
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,640
Everything will get better.

912
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
Hope so.

913
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,080
All right. I should go.

914
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,410
You get some rest early.

915
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,850
I won't bother you.

916
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,250
It's OK. It's no bother.

917
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,120
- I should go.
- Let me walk you out.

918
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,160
Don't bother. Do what you need to do.

919
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,960
See you, Granny.

920
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,930
OK. Goodbye.

921
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,560
(She used to be very outgoing)

922
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,160
(and beautiful.)

923
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,770
(Because of her calf,)

924
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,970
(she's been living all alone)

925
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,410
(and her life is wasted.)

926
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,730
What happened?

927
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,130
Don't help me.

928
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,130
Don't.

929
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,970
I can walk by myself.

930
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,480
It's a good day, huh?

931
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,370
(Xing,)

932
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,730
(do some thinking)

933
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,160
(about our entrepreneurship.)

934
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,450
(3D medical printing)

935
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,680
has a very good prospect.

936
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,370
It's for all the patients, too.

937
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,080
(Under such circumstances,)

938
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,930
(working with Dr. Jiang)

939
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,120
(will be your best choice.)

940
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,120
Why do you not sleep so late,

941
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,290
but get ocean breezes here?

942
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,480
I can't sleep and I'm out for some air.

943
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,690
What about you?

944
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,850
I can't sleep and I'm out for some air.

945
