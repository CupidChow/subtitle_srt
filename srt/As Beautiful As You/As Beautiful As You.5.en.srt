It's OK to be small.

As long as we live a meaningful life.

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,930
However vast it is,

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,680
some small efforts can

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,160
make a difference.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,090

very small contributions,

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,250
they'll also be meaningful.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,210

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600

43
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,210
I think this is the point

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,330
of developing medical technology.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,400
It's also the original purpose of our team

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,810

All we needed to do

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,120
was work hard towards one direction.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,120
Sometimes when one goes too far,

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,530

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,170

I left in a hurry.

81

You should have at least called.

82
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,160
It's my fault.

83
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,130

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,170
you can talk to her.

88

It's OK.

89
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,970

Did you succeed in hunting?

96
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,210
To recruit the talent,

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,360
you've been there

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
in the fishing village, huh?

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,890

100
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,840
to accept your offer?

101
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,280
I've got it all under control.

was solved so quickly

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,330
and she had a terrible blow.

107
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,330
Now, she's lurking.

108

113

start a company with me?

114
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,170
I'm not welcome?

115
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,600
Yes. You're so welcome.

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,650
I'm just happy.

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,010
I used to think,

118
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,330
"When I do technical work,

119
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,690
I can get as much

120
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,600
as I give."

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,770
Later, I realized

122
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,650
that wasn't always the case.

123

124
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,450
I figured out a lot.

125
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,130

131
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,890
and that energizes you, huh?

132

When you play poorly,

133
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,450
you start to find excuses, huh?

Anyway,

147

I'm thankful to you and your company
for this acknowledgment.

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,530
to Qingtian Fishing Village

153
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,360
and reminded her of her original dream.

154
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,210
Then she decided to start a company.

155
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
Kind of fun.

it's an offer from Dongyang Medical.

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,840
And Mr. Han recruited you personally.

161
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,330
Are you sure you'll reject it?

162
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,520
Since I've made my choice,

163
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,690
I will not hover.

164
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,560
Xing,

165
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,000
I will not let you down.

Let's work hard together.

167
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,250
We will.

168
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,570
Oh, by the way,

169
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,600
about our company,

170
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,930
did you tell Yichen?

171
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,330
No. He isn't back yet.

172
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,760
When he's back in a couple of days,

173
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,880
I'll tell him to his face.

174
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,210
He will support me.

175
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,050
OK.

176
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,880
What are you smirking about?

177
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,240
I didn't expect you for another week.

178
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,450
I finished work ahead of schedule

179
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,480
and wanted to see you earlier.

180
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,330
Dahuang, why do you ignore me?

181
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,720
The food I bought you was wasted.

182
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,290
You were on such a long business trip.

183
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,410
If you came back even later,

184
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,360
it would stay farther.

185
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,930
- Dahuang.
- Have dinner here.

186
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,240
I'll invite my friends

187
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
to welcome you back.

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,970
OK. You seem to be in a good mood.

189
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm relieved, then.

190
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,090
I thought you would be depressed for a while

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,090
after you lost your job.

192
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,290
I was about to tell you something.

193
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,170
I know.

194
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,930
(3D Printing)
Do you want a job

195
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,930
about 3D medical printing?

196
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,360
You're only half right.

197
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,720
I want to work on 3D medical printing.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,570
But I want to start my own company.

199
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
Xing,

200
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,570
it's not that easy

201
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,450
to start a company.

202
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,330
I don't want you

203
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,480
to make an impulsive decision

204
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,970
in a fit of anger.

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Rest assured, Yichen.

206
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,450
I'm not impulsive or angry.

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,050
I thought about it carefully.

208
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,410
Xing,

209
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
you just resigned.

210
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,930
I want you

211
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,640
to take a good rest at home

212
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,520
and calm down, OK?

213
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,930
I know it's hard to start a company.

214
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,840
But is it easy to be an employee?

215
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,840
It's not, either.

216
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,520
Don't worry. I'll go slow.

217
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,690
At least, in this case,

218
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,050
I can do what I want to do.

219
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,480
Xing,

220
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,250
you have to know.

221
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,930
Whatever decision you make,

222
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,360
I'll support you unconditionally.

223
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
After all, your boyfriend

224
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
is an orthopedic surgeon

225
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
with a promising future.

226
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,050
I think I can help a lot.

227
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,770
But anyway, I want you

228
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,410
to think very carefully

229
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,250
before making a decision.

230
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,250
Or...

231
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,760
How about you think about our future?

232
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,840
Maybe you'll have some other ideas.

233
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,170
- It really...
- It really ignores me.

234
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,290
Dahuang.

235
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,720
Boiled Fish with Pickles.

236
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,570
It's been a long time

237
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,640
since I last tasted it.

238
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,170
Then have some more later.

239
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,840
Smells so good.

240
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,210
Wei Qiuzi is here.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
There you are, Qiuzi.

242
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,690
Long time no see, Yichen.

243
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,600
Make yourself at home. I'm cooking.

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
OK.

245
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
Qiuzi, why are you so late?

246
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
In the Institute of Materials,

247
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,050
you never work overtime, do you?

248
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,210
We've been working on a new project.

249
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,330
I was modifying a report
of high polymer material.

250
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,170
Come and sit.

251
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,930
I bought you some food on my way here.

252
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,930
I'll plate it up.

253
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,600
- OK.
- Nice.

254
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Don't bother, Qiuzi.

255
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,600
Leave it here.

256
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll plate it up.

257
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,640
It's OK. Let me help you.

258
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
Qiuzi, please hand me

259
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,760
that plate.

260
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,770
OK.

261
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,480
Thanks.

262
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,880
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

263
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,120
Aren't you supposed
to announce something big?

264
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,960
What is it?

265
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,600
Now?

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,170
Fine. It's something very important.

267
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,970
I'm 28 years old.

268
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,520
If I still hover,

269
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,090
it may be too late.

270
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm going

271
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,170
to start up a business.

272
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Start...

273
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,480
Start up a business?

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,810
I thought you would announce your marriage.

275
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,520
I was even ready to cheer.

276
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,760
Why do you not cheer for my business?

277
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,570
That's not what I mean.

278
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,210
To start a company isn't as easy

279
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,170
as you think it is.

280
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,570
With your experience,

281
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,970
you can get a very good job

282
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,970
in a big company.

283
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,640
Don't you remember my non-compete agreement?

284
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,410
And I don't want that kind of job.

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,720
But...

286
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,480
You can take some rest.

287
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,930
Why do you have to start a company?

288
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,410
You know what? In Qingtian Fishing Village,

289
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,970
I met an old lady.

290
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,120
Because she couldn't afford

291
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,090
a customized artificial calf,

292
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,520
her life was wasted.

293
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,170
Her whole life.

294
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,640
Customized 3D medical printing

295
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,930
will give these people

296
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,840
a better life.

297
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,600
This is the meaning and purpose

298
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,450
of my business.

299
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,290
Xing, have you made up your mind?

300
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,360
Yes, I have.

301
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,480
I want to have a try.

302
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,360
I've modified

303
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,690
Su Zhizhou's proposal many times.

304
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,930
I'm familiar with it.

305
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,360
I'll start a company with him.

306
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,570
But Xing, it means

307
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,880
you'll put all your time and money

308
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,970
on your business.

309
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,440
But you...

310
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,480
You want to buy a flat, don't you?

311
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,890
Xing,

312
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,050
I know something terrible happened to you

313
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,360
when you worked in Guanghua.

314
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,640
But you can't make a decision

315
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
on the spur of the moment.

316
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,210
Some people succeed

317
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,600
while some people fail.

318
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,690
What if you collapse in your business?

319
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,170
I've never given up

320
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,050
on my dream.

321
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,520
It's not that I don't like working

322
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
or getting a job.

323
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,000
I just don't like those people.

324
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,570
So, I would rather collapse in my business

325
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,090
than die in their office.

326
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,170
Besides,

327
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,290
what if I survive?

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
Since Xing has made her choice,

329
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,640
I'll support her no matter what.

330
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,050
Looks like no one can stop you.

331
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,930
How's it going with Su Zhizhou?

332
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,170
The day after tomorrow,
we'll do the overall plan.

333
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,210
If you have any problems

334
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,600
in marketing or sales,

335
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
let me know.

336
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,410
If you have any confusion about material,

337
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,250
let me know.

338
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,330
Xing, if your company

339
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,520
needs a streamer or spokeswoman,

340
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm on call 24 hours.

341
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,570
OK. We don't need a spokeswoman.

342
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,170
I'm sure

343
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,810
I'm really lucky enough

344
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,970
to have met you guys.

345
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,090
Come on. Cheers.

346
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,410
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

347
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,930
Let's drink.

348
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,600
It's my luck

349
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,970
to have such angelical friends.

350
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,600
And Yichen.

351
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,890
I'll drink it up.

352
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:55,930
Xing.

353
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
You're lucky

354
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,930
to have a boyfriend like Shao Yichen.

355
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,050
He can support you

356
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,970
technically and mentally.

357
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,450
Wait for me.

358
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,370
I'm so jealous.

359
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,930
I should also support you financially.

360
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,720
It was for the down payment.

361
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,810
You take it.

362
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,850
Behind every successful woman

363
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,890
is a man who always contributes.

364
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
Xing,

365
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,520
do something, will you?

366
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,410
Oh, give me a boyfriend

367
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,240
just like Shao Yichen.

368
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,040
No way. Only one Shao Yichen.

369
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,210
He's mine.

370
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,170
But I remember he has a cousin

371
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,000
handsome and fair-skinned with big eyes.

372
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,170
You... You'll like him.

373
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,410
Yeah.

374
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,760
Introduce him to me.

375
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,130
Qiuzi, would you like one?

376
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,080
Come on. Let's drink.

377
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,850
Wholesale boyfriends.

378
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,520
Do you have enough cousins?

379
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
Yes.

380
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
Give me some.

381
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,570
- Some more.
- Here.

382
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,760
- It's empty.
- Thanks.

383
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,450
How much did you just drink?

384
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
Yichen.

385
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,930
OK. Put it here.

386
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,040
Yichen,

387
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,130
do you really support Xing?

388
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,130
I don't mean she'll fail.

389
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,800
I just worry she'll have a hard time.

390
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,170
It's hard to start a company.

391
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,930
Many friends of mine started a company

392
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,480
and lost everything.

393
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,280
Xing is very career-minded.

394
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,890
It's good when she has

395
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,730
some business to do.

396
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
It's OK if she loses money.

397
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,730
I'll back her up.

398
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,000
So, Yichen,

399
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,170
you also think she will fail

400
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,970
and you just want her to be occupied?

401
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,480
You know

402
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,610
Xing's temperament.

403
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,560
She won't stop before running into a wall.

404
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,080
I would let her try it.

405
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,520
If she's obsessed with her dream,

406
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,210
she will not

407
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,370
really settle down.

408
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,560
Yichen, it's so thoughtful of you.

409
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,690
Xing is really happy

410
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,850
to be with you.

411
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,380
(Dongyang Medical, President's Office)

412
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,080
Just say it.

413
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,320
Boss,

414
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,930
Miss Ji is downstairs

415
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:46,890
for her departure procedure.

416
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,970
Would you like to get her up and talk?

417
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,450
No need.

418
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,130
Boss, come on.

419
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,520
Who told you I would see her?

420
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,240
Then where are you going?
Let me drive you.

421
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,080
No need.

422
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,040
I've uploaded all the materials

423
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,280
to the network disk.

424
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,280
If you have confusion,

425
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,690
call me at any time.

426
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,040
Don't worry.

427
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,520
I'll miss you.

428
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,410
What do I do? I don't want to leave you.

429
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,690
You'll certainly miss her.

430
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,370
When she is gone,

431
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,170
no one will clean up your mess.

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,130
Speaking of this,

433
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,970
someone hates it more

434
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,320
when Ji Xing leaves, huh?

435
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,690
Report thief.

436
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,530
Thief?

437
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,730
Weiwei,

438
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,650
remember

439
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,800
to give my new planning for Bay

440
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,520
to your superior.

441
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,480
I get it.

442
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
You want to prove

443
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,130
township hospitals need Bay

444
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,560
more than big hospitals, right?

445
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,480
You still think about work before leaving.

446
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,210
Way too competitive!

447
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,800
Here are my notes on Bay

448
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
in the past three years.

449
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,650
Hope you'll always keep Bay company.

450
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,760
I'll leave Bay to you guys.

451
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,890
Ji Xing, let's get together when possible.

452
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,650
Good luck with everything.

453
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,170
Take care.

454
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,810
Goodbye.

455
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
Hello.

456
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,610
Hey, Xing.

457
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,520
Why did you give my bank card back?

458
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,800
I did some calculations.

459
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,970
My savings

460
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,080
will be enough for months.

461
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,040
You keep the card for now.

462
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,560
When I need money, I'll ask for it.

463
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,130
When you're in need,

464
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,970
let me know.

465
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,490
OK.

466
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,770
Xing.

467
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,690
I'm always your strongest backing.

468
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,410
I'll let you work.

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,840
OK.

470
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,000
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

471
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,560
Strawberry cake, please.

472
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,040
The same old taste. What, in a bad good?

473
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,490
Mr. Han.

474
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Shall we talk?

475
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,760
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

476
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,970
You will start up a business?

477
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
What business exactly?

478
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,410
3D medical printing.

479
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,480
Any advice, Mr. Han?

480
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,760
I don't dare.

481
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,080
I gave some advice
and you decided to start a company.

482
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
If I give you more advice,

483
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,040
you'll be really arrogant.

484
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,450
I know.

485
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm ungrateful to have rejected your offer.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,840
No.

487
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,280
You're free to choose a job.

488
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,370
I'm here

489
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,280
just to see how you'll lose.

490
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,520
It can be a warning

491
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,760
for those start-up companies

492
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,000
I've invested in.

493
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,650
What is your problem?

494
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,760
How do you know I will fail?

495
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,080
First, considering

496
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,000
your startup capital,

497
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,280
it's even hard for you

498
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,610
to rent a good office.

499
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,800
Besides, daily operation

500
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,000
and the salary thing
are also money-consuming.

501
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
I'm not as rich as you.

502
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,480
But I've saved some money over the years.

503
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,130
It can support me for some time.

504
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
To start a company is like taking part

505
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,560
in a game to win.

506
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,720
Once you start, you can't stop.

507
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,210
How long

508
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,650
can your savings hold?

509
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Financing.

510
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,210
With funds, things will improve.

511
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,850
Have you dealt with investors before?

512
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,080
Are they just rich idiots

513
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,480
who splash out?

514
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,890
Now, you have nothing.

515
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,210
How can you get financing?

516
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,800
My partner and I have confidence.

517
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,040
You used to work on medical robots.

518
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,610
Now, you suddenly start

519
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,690
to do 3D medical printing.

520
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,000
Why do you think you can succeed?

521
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,730
Mr. Han,

522
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,280
before you went abroad,

523
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,930
could you speak fluent German?

524
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,240
People change in response

525
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,280
to the environment.

526
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,320
I should go.

527
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,340
(Tang Song)

528
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,360
Hello.

529
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,650
Boss, Dr. Jiang called and asked

530
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,760
when Miss Ji would start to work.

531
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,690
Tell him I'll get him someone else.

532
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,410
Is this house

533
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,080
the surprise you talked about?

534
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,210
Yes. This is where we're incorporated.

535
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,130
When did you rent it?

536
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,480
Is the rent high?

537
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,240
Don't worry. No rent.

538
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,040
Years ago, my father

539
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,900
started his business here.

540
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,240
To him,

541
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,280
this house has a special meaning.

542
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,930
To me,

543
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,130
starting our company here

544
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,130
will be somehow inheriting him.

545
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm grateful to your father.

546
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,370
This house looks like

547
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,210
a very lucky place.

548
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,720
That's what I think.

549
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,000
Let's open the door

550
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,130
to our future.

551
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,320
Here we go.

552
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,400
Are you OK?

553
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,930
It's a big room.

554
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,930
A bit messy, though.

555
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,080
It was a supermarket. All the stuff.

556
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,610
It's OK. We can tidy it.

557
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
Zhizhou,

558
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,850
I have some savings over the years.

559
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,690
Four hundred thousand in it.

560
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,280
Use it as the start-up capital.

561
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,850
No. We made a deal.

562
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,690
I'll offer the start-up capital.

563
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,080
You've offered the office.

564
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,690
I should also do something, right?

565
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,890
Since I've decided to start a company,

566
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,610
I don't mind burning my bridges.

567
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,610
Xing, I see your point.

568
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,730
But it's the money

569
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,410
for your down payment on a flat, right?

570
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,930
Use my money first.

571
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,320
It can hold for a few months.

572
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,370
And my father said

573
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,650
he had a surprise for me.

574
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,490
Let me look for it.

575
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,690

576
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,370

578
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,560

579
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,240
Zhizhou,

580
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm not giving you any money. What?

581
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,210
This house

582
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,720
and everything in it

583
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720

584
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
Father offers.

Do protect them.

00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,320

When you can't continue, come back

588
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,210
and do warehouse logistics with me.

589
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,130
Don't call me.

590
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,130
I won't answer, anyway.

591
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,410
What is this?

592
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,520
Where's my start-up capital?

593
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,890
Money in it can hold for a few months.

594
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
Come on, Xing.

595
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560

he would support me.

597
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,370
Or I wouldn't offer to partner with you.

598
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,080
No. I can't take the money.

599
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,130
Well, when I was in college,

600
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,720
I often made apps to make money.

601
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,830
I will do part-time jobs

604
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,000

605
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,480

00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,730
I have abundant resources.

757
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,250
Hey, don't go.

758
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,520
Come back here.

759
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,850
We can negotiate.

760
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,890
They fish with no bait.

761
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,480
(Business Model)
When the probe gets into the key part,

762
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
we can see where the foreign object is.

763
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,450
Later, we made a colored edition.

764
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:34,850
In the organ, we can see

765
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,120
where exactly the foreign object is.

766
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,160
We can also see

767
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
the entire surgery.

768
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,320
Mr. Ma, actually...

769
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,730
What are you doing?

770
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,090
Give me your phone!

771
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,200
- What's wrong?
- Give me it!

772
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,210
Why?

773
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
Delete it!

774
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,000
Opportunism.

775
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,330
Well, I like

776
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,170
your project.

777
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,330
As long as you get a lead investor,

778
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,730
I'll invest a million, too.

779
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,890
Call me when you get a lead investor.

780
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,850
OK. See you.

781
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,160
Extremely realistic.

782
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,440
Hello.

783
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,440
Hello.

784
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,970
It's been four hours.

785
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,680
Could you please ask Mr. Liu

786
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,120
when he'll have time?

787
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,680
OK. I'm on it.

788
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,120
Hello. Is Mr. Liu available now?

789
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,480
Miss Ji from Xingchen...

790
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,730
OK.

791
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,200
Sorry. Mr. Liu is in a meeting now.

792
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,770
How about this?

793
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,780
Please give this to Mr. Liu.

794
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,200
When he has time,

795
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,520
please request him to review it.

796
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,480
OK. No problem.

797
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,000
Thank you. Do give it to him, please.

798
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,640
- I will.
- Thank you.

799
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,420
(Business Proposal)

800
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,730
You two make a perfect couple.

801
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,730
When you proposed to combine

802
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,730
software with hardware,

803
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,250
she started a company

804
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,200
on 3D printing.

805
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,930
She's supplementing you.

806
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,080
Will you consider investing in her?

807
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,000
Maybe another time.

808
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,320
Miss Ji,

809
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,200
Xingchen Technology is a start-up company

810
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,100
with poor bank statements.

811
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,730
Under our current regulations,

812
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,000
you can't get a loan.

813
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,890
OK. I get it.

814
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,060
(My Account)

815
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,260
To start a company is like taking part

816
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,040
in a game to win.

817
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,410
Once you start, you can't stop.

818
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,730
How long can your savings hold?

819
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,770
I checked the proposals

820
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,440
of Shang and Xia.

821
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,600
Xia has totally qualified techniques

822
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,120
and can start the analog product.

823
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,160
Shang isn't as skilled as Xia.

824
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,600
But he's honest and hard-working.

825
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,970
Here's my plan. We can have him

826
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,410
give Xia some general assistance.

827
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,890
Sharing some daily work, for example.

828
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,250
Sadly, we haven't had

829
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,330
enough investment

830
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,520
and can't afford a printer.

831
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,040
Even if the analog product is done,

832
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,000
we can hardly go further.

833
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,970
Zhizhou, I think we can...

834
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,730
I have to take this.

835
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,370
Hello.

836
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,890
Miss Ji, this is Tang Song.

837
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,200
Mr. Han wants to talk to you

838
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,480
in Dongyang Medical

839
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,480
at eleven tomorrow morning.

840
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,770
Do you have time?

841
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,600
Tomorrow, I'll have things to do

842
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,890
and I can't go.

843
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,520
Please tell Mr. Han about it.

844
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,090
OK.

845
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,130
Thank you.

846
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,290
Who is it, Xing?

847
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,520
Han Ting's assistant called for an appointment.

848
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Han Ting? Han Ting from Dongyang Medical?

849
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,640
Oh, God, Xing.

850
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,000
Why will you not go?

851
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,640
What if Mr. Han wants to invest in us?

852
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,840
That's not the case.

853
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,330
He wants me to work for Dongyang.

854
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,480
I rejected him but he still called.

855
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,770
I'm in very high demand.

856
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,480
Come on, Xing.

857
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,080
It's Han Ting from Dongyang Medical.

858
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,520
How about this?

859
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,450
Let's visit him

860
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,330
for the investment.

861
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,970
Now, we are

862
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,290
in such a bad situation.

863
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,850
Just give it a try.

864
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,370
Please.

865
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,410
What if Mr. Han changes his mind?

866
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,890
If you don't go, I'll jump.

867
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,730
You...

868
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,600
But I just rejected him.

869
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,930
It's nothing.

870
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,000
Tell him

871
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,640
we thought about it

872
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,480
and decided to go.

873
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,840
Xing,

874
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,040
think about our dream.

875
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,160
At eleven tomorrow morning,

876
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,550
I'll see you at Dongyang Medical.

877
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,290
(Ji Xing: I'll see you at Dongyang Medical.)

878
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,130
(Han Ting)
OK.

879
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,450
Done. We'll see him
at Dongyang Medical at eleven tomorrow.

880
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,890
God bless us.

881
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,480
Sounds as if you could persuade him.

882
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,290
There's hope, anyway.

883
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,730
Life is so hard.

884
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,810
Come this way.

885
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,930
Please wait a minute here.

886
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,930
Mr. Han will be right there.

887
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,810
Be seated, please.

888
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,890
- OK. Thanks.
- Thank you.

889
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,650
Xing,

890
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,290
this office

891
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,160
is even bigger than our company, huh?

892
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,560
Look at the height.

893
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,680
If only my future office

894
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,890
could be this big!

895
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,640
I don't even dare hope.

896
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,480
Oh, Xing.

897
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,730
It's an ocean view room.

898
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,730
(Main areas:
Vascular&amp;Non-vascular intervention)

899
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,570
Look.

900
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,970
Isn't this our proposal?

901
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,880
Don't touch it.

902
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,780
(Recovery from surgery,
More critical patients)

903
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,130
Mr. Han.

904
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,090
Mr. Han.

905
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,320
Who is this?

906
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,770
This is my partner.

907
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,250
Su Zhizhou from Xingchen.

908
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,560
Mr. Han, I didn't know

909
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,560
you had our business proposal.

910
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,410
You handed out your business proposals

911
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,600
as if they were leaflets.

912
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:52,890
I can hardly avoid it.

913
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,930
We just saw

914
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,330
your comments on it.

915
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,250
Really sharp.

916
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,120
Xingchen doesn't have

917
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,520
any irreplaceable competitiveness.

918
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,850
In other words,

919
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,040
it's basically waste paper.

920
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,450
Our competitiveness is manpower.

921
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,640
Our key members are research talents

922
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,770
from different universities.

923
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,770
Behind us

924
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,330
are abundant resources

925
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,520
of professors and schoolmates.

926
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,850
We also have close ties to universities

927
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,730
and institutes.

928
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,160
We have techniques.

929
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,640
We have talents, too.

930
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,120
What we need is money.

931
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,120
You want to get financing with a PPT.

932
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,930
You think investors are angels?

933
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't mean to question your ability.

934
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,200
But if you want to make a big difference,

935
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,680
why don't you do 3D medical printing here?

936
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,890
We're going to establish

937
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,970
a department of 3D medical printing.

938
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,480
You guys will be in charge.

939
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,290
Based on our systems and channels,

940
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,250
you can carry out projects.

941
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,120
After you start to work here,

942
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,730
you can name a price

943
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,930
for your pay.

944
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,340
(Proposal of 3D Medical Printing Department)

945
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,040
I know.

946
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,850
Dreams should be encouraged.

947
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,330
But however big a dream is,

948
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,450
it should be grounded in reality.

949
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,090
In the business thing,

950
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,000
you'll fail.

951
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Mr. Han, what do you think

952
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,040
are our problems?

953
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,370
You have techniques and talents.

954
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,810
Let's suppose you have devices

955
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,120
and funds, too.

956
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,120
You still have a deadly problem.

957
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,330
On operation, management, and channels.

958
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,250
You lack management experience

959
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:54,970
as well as top connections in the industry.

960
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,520
Without sales or channels,

961
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,200
how can you put your product into the market?

962
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,610
Mr. Han, we...

963
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,640
Thank you for reminding us.

964
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,970
I've kept that in mind.

965
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,520
When I'm back, I'll rethink and make it up.

966
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,000
And thank you

967
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,810
for sparing your time to make

968
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,520
such detailed comments on this leaflet.

969
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,000
I can tell

970
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,040
you value and care

971
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,120
for our company.

972
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,160
Mr. Han, since you don't want to invest,

973
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,680
we'll leave you alone.

974
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,600
Hope we can cooperate somewhere else.

975
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,370
We were schoolmates anyway.

976
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,040
There's still friendship, huh?

977
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
No friendship.

978
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,200
In business, there are either partners

979
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,210
or enemies.
