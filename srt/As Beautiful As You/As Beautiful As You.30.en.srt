If you don't mind,

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,760
I should go.

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,760
Mr. Su.

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,040
I like you.

28
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,870
You...

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
I know you adore Miss Li.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,230
So, I just want you to know how I feel for you.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,040
Since I came here,

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,510
you've helped me a lot.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,230
Since then,

34
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,510
I've been in love with you.

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,960
You're the vice general manager,

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,310
but you don't put on airs.

37
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,870
When you work,

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,630
you're so serious.

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
I hope

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,960
you'll consider me.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,910
You're a very good girl.

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,840
But...

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,000
I only take you

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,910
as a colleague and friend.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,360
What about the future? I can wait.

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,560
Hope you won't

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,030
waste your time on me.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,680
I have a boyfriend.

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,280
We're in a stable relationship.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
So, stop wasting

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,310
your time on me.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Fine.

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
I get it.

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,240
It's OK. Loving someone

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,870
doesn't necessarily need a response.

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,470
I'll adjust my emotions.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,150
Mr. Su, don't worry about it.

59
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Hope we'll still be colleagues

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,080
and friends.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
We will be.

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,870
Go back home early.

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
I should go.

65
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,520
Thank you for yesterday.

66
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Not at all.

67
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,680
I just got you a designated driver.

68
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,240
These are the presents you gave me.

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,750
Take them back.

70
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm going back.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,630
Is there nothing else

72
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,480
we can talk about?

73
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,160
Oh, there is.

74
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,360
Xiao Yixiao,

75
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,920
when you're drunk again,

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,430
don't call me anymore.

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
Hey, Grandpa.

78
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,030
Grandson,

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
how long haven't you been back home?

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
You still know

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
you have a grandpa, huh?

82
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,480
I've been too busy working.

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,800
These days,

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
your grandaunt and I

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070
have been staying at my place.

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,310
When you have time, come back for lunch

87
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,710
and talk to me.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,400
Grandpa,

89
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,430
I want to take someone back for lunch.

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
Ji Xing?

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Yes. We're in a relationship.

92
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,800
I want her

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
to officially meet you.

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,880
OK.

95
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,360
Grandpa, don't scare her.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,430
Fine. I'll hang up.

97
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,240
What? In a bad mood?

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,830
Previously, we applied

99
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,950
for the Pioneer Project.

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
Experts and leaders of Xinggang

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,430
approved it.

102
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,240
But a while back, we were told
that we were ousted.

103
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
Hanhai replaced us.

104
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
There will be better chances.

105
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,720
I understand.

106
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,240
Hanhai is bigger and more mature.

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I just think

108
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,390
we have to face the competition with Hanhai.

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,870
Xingchen started late.

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,120
It's no match for Hanhai in every way.

111
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,910
Don't worry.

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
Products and technology
are the foundation of a company.

113
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,160
Only when you focus on your own business

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
can you survive the competition.

115
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
Besides,

116
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,430
I back you up now.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,950
Don't think too much.

118
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,830
Come on, Miss Ji.

119
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,350
Mr. Han,

120
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Xingchen and Hanhai

121
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,360
fought for the Pioneer Project

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,390
and it was just the start.

123
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm worried

124
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,870
more things like this

125
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,040
will happen in the future.

126
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,270
It's not convenient to reveal

127
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,750
your relationship with Hanhai.

128
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
And Miss Ji is your girlfriend.

129
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
In terms of our competition with Xingchen,

130
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,800
I really don't know how far to go.

131
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,600
What is this place?

132
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,230
My grandpa's home.

133
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
We had an appointment

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,160
to have lunch together.

135
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,920
I'll see your grandpa?

136
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

137
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,430
I've got nothing.

138
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,000
I could have worn something else. I...

139
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,510
You always look gorgeous.

140
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,120
But I want to make a good impression.

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Just rest assured.

142
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,390
I have a present for you.

143
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,080
It's...

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,910
It makes a pair
with the star necklace you gave me.

145
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,750
It's a pair, huh?

146
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,120
I'll put it on now.

147
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,990
OK.

148
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,470
Come on.

149
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,510
Be careful.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
How do I look?

151
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,630
I've seen your parents.

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,550
Now, I'm taking you to see my grandpa.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
I'll behave well.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Don't worry.

155
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,470
Not that.

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
I just want to tell you

157
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
the two of us

158
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,390
will have seen each other's family.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
So, you can't regret it.

160
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,870
In the future,

161
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,030
whatever happens,

162
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,150
you must not regret it.

163
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,150
No idea who will regret it first.

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,750
- Let's go.
- OK.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
Grandaunt.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
There you are.

167
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,440
Hello. You must be Ji Xing.

168
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,630
You look prettier than your photo.

169
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Come on.

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Don't scare her.

171
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,350
I won't.

172
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
You must be Lu Linjia's mother.

173
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,560
It's clever of you, young girl.

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I often hear Miss Xiaomeng

175
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,630
talk about her best friend Ji Xing.

176
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,240
Today, I'm finally seeing you.

177
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,150
Xiaomeng often talked about you, too.

178
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,200
She did? What did she say about me?

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,750
She said you could sing beautifully

180
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,320
and you could make very delicious soup.

181
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,030
She flattered me in singing.

182
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,750
But I indeed make delicious soup.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Another day,

184
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
come to my house with Miss Xiaomeng.

185
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,440
I'll make you some soup.

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,670
OK.

187
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,790
Let's get in there.

188
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,750
- Go.
- Everybody's waiting.

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,320
They're in the house.

190
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,350
Come on.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,480
The tea tastes great.

192
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,750
There she is.

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
Come on.

194
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,720
You must be Ji Xing.

195
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
Let me introduce them.

196
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
This is my cousin.

197
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
And this is my aunt.

198
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
My uncle is on a business trip abroad.

199
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,270
Hello, Mrs. Han. Hello, Ms. Yuan.

200
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,750
Such a pretty girl.

201
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,600
Some presents for our first meeting.

202
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,080
- Thanks.
- It's so nice of you. Leave them to me.

203
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,440
Come on. Take your seat.

204
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,280
Don't stand here.

205
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,130
Be seated.

206
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,200
Come on.

207
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,270
Just sit down there.

208
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,110
Mr. Han,

209
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,750
your grandpa asked to see you.

210
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,630
Just go. Don't worry. I'm here for her.

211
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,510
We'll have a girl talk.

212
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,590
Go ahead.

213
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,150
Don't stand there.

214
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,480
Have her sit down.

215
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,550
Ji Xing, be seated.

216
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,390
Just sit.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Have some tea.

218
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
OK.

219
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,560
Thanks.

220
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,120
The production of this kind of tea

221
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
is very low this year.

222
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,870
A few days ago,

223
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,000
Zeng Di brought this little to us.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,150
I won't drink any.

225
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,320
Too much tea is bad for the stomach.

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,600
I've got a stomach problem lately.

227
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,150
This tea tastes great.

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,790
Miss Zeng has good taste.

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Oh, Ji Xing.

230
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,390
Where are you from?

231
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,120
What do your parents do?

232
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,630
I'm from Chuancheng.

233
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,390
My mother works in the community

234
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,550
and my father is self-employed.

235
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,360
Oh, you're from Chuancheng?

236
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,510
That explains.

237
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,510
I wondered

238
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,510
why she had such smooth skin.

239
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,630
A girl like you

240
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,120
works alone in Xinggang.

241
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,960
You must have suffered a lot.

242
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,320
Luckily, you met Ting.

243
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,120
Actually, I think it's also Ting's luck

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
to have met Xing.

245
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,510
What time is it?

246
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Oh, it's lunchtime.

247
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
Let's not drink tea.

248
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,150
Let's get down for lunch.

249
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,080
We can eat and talk.

250
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,590
Let's go.

251
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,700
Go ahead.

252
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
You two get down soon.

253
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,120
- This way.
- OK.

254
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,390
You're so thin. Eat some more.

255
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
- This way.
- OK.

256
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,990
Xing, you take this seat.

257
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,870
Sit next to me.

258
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
Don't be nervous.

259
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,910
Check the dishes. Tell me what you want.

260
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,910
I'll get it to you.

261
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,110
Thanks, Ms. Han.

262
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,480
How can you call me that?

263
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
As if we were strangers.

264
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,590
Besides,

265
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
Ting calls me Grandaunt.

266
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,360
If you call me Ms. Han,

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
it'll be messy.

268
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,320
You can call me Grandaunt

269
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,910
just like Ting.

270
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,390
Grandaunt.

271
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,110
Xing.

272
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,510
Grandpa, this is my girlfriend Ji Xing.

273
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,960
Hi, Mr. Han.

274
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
Hi.

275
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Take your seat.

276
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,590
Come on.

277
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,030
All right. Let's eat.

278
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,720
I heard you and Han Ting

279
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
were schoolmates in college.

280
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,630
It's been ten years.

281
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,240
After he was back in China, he invested in you.

282
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,600
So, you've always lingered in his mind.

283
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,240
Ms. Yuan, don't you remember?

284
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
You offered me an investment

285
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,720
earlier than Han Ting.

286
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,390
If he and I weren't old schoolmates,

287
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,790
I might be working for Dongyang Technology now.

288
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,630
Yeah. In this case,

289
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,150
I poached her from you, Yuan.

290
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
Yuan, you don't mind, do you?

291
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Don't say that.

292
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,630
We're a family, after all.

293
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,030
Actually, at that time,

294
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,200
Ms. Yuan gave me a good offer.

295
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,390
I was tempted.

296
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,840
But Han Ting's thinking

297
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,440
accorded more with mine.

298
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,440
After I discussed it

299
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,510
with my partners,

300
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,600
we chose Dongyang Medical.

301
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,030
Different companies, but the same goal.

302
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,480
Dongyang Medical and Technology

303
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
are both affiliated with Dongyang Group.

304
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
So, in the end,

305
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,360
we're all working for Dongyang Group.

306
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,510
On the market,

307
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,480
Hanhai is the most successful

308
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,550
in 3D medical printing.

309
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,550
Ji Xing, in your plan,

310
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,000
how long will it take

311
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,390
before you catch up with Hanhai

312
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,840
or even exceed it?

313
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,550
Products and technology

314
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,030
are the foundation of a company.

315
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,360
Only when you focus on your own business

316
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,960
can you survive the competition.

317
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,550
To be honest, Mr. Han,

318
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,030
I don't think Xingchen

319
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,240
can exceed Hanhai

320
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,790
in a short time.

321
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,990
Or rather,

322
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,720
exceeding Hanhai isn't in my future plan.

323
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
I'm all ears.

324
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,550
Hanhai started

325
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,840
five years earlier.

326
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,870
It's well-established now.

327
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,030
Instead of competing with them in expanse,

328
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,160
I would rather

329
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,390
focus on developing skeletons.

330
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,120
We'll specialize in it

331
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,870
and go our own way.

332
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,790
It's a family lunch.

333
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,390
Why are you talking about work again?

334
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,600
Let's eat, Brother.

335
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,910
All right. Let's eat.

336
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,870
Xing.

337
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,470
- Have some beef.
- Thanks.

338
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,200
Eat some more.

339
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,120
Since Ting came back to China,

340
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,510
he's been really busy.

341
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,750
So, he seldom comes here.

342
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,350
Since you were in a relationship,

343
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,310
has he bullied you?

344
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,480
No. He's nice to me.

345
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,310
I can see that.

346
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,550
He really cares about you.

347
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,750
When he was little,

348
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,030
he was a lively boy and loved to smile.

349
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,750
Such a good boy.

350
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,350
Later,

351
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,350
after his parents

352
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,440
passed away,

353
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,790
he was more and more repressed.

354
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,200
He was all alone.

355
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,200
Especially after he went to Germany,

356
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,310
he was like cold ice.

357
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,590
He stayed all alone

358
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,790
and didn't tell us anything.

359
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,720
In case of trouble,

360
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,960
he went through it alone, too.

361
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,000
Be careful.

362
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,400
I also asked him

363
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
about his life in Germany.

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
But he always told me

365
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,160
very little about it.

366
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,750
Maybe he didn't want you

367
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,960
to worry about him.

368
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,640
So, he is independent and sensible.

369
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,000
He's so sensible

370
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,640
that I feel sorry for him.

371
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,160
But I've found out this.

372
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,960
Since Ting was in a relationship with you,

373
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,030
he has changed.

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,750
Now, he talks and laughs.

375
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,440
He cares about people, too.

376
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,760
To be honest,

377
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,750
I feel happy for you.

378
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,550
Thank you, Grandaunt.

379
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,870
Xing.

380
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,760
Grandpa wanted to see you.

381
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,260
(Xing and Ting)

382
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,920
Your calligraphy is great.

383
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,830
I named him "Ting".

384
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,310
It means "giving out orders

385
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,720
and holding court."

386
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,720
Quite imposing.

387
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,680
Your parents named you "Xing".

388
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,160
What does it mean?

389
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,310
They said when I was born,

390
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,720
I had big eyes.

391
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,030
They gleamed

392
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,240
just like stars.

393
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,640
Then they gave me this name.

394
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,400
Looks like

395
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,350
your names

396
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,640
have quite different meanings.

397
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,520
Yes.

398
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,200
Different, indeed.

399
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,070
A star is faint.

400
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,590
But it never stops glowing.

401
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,030
A little spark kindles a great fire.

402
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,830
I guess my parents

403
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,400
want their daughter

404
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,510
to gather her power and then prosper.

405
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,160
The ink isn't dry yet.

406
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,160
Maybe another time.

407
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,550
Another time, I'll give it to you.

408
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,080
OK.

409
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,700
(Xing and Ting)

410
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,400
That lunch is like an examination.

411
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,920
What? Scared?

412
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,590
Not at all.

413
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,310
Your grandpa wrote down our names.

414
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,920
So, he doesn't hate me.

415
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,200
But he said

416
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,480
he would give it to me another time

417
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,920
instead of giving it to me immediately.

418
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,080
It means

419
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,550
I haven't completely passed his test.

420
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,240
Looks like you have totally

421
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,880
seen through my grandpa.

422
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,440
I stay with you all day long

423
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
and I can see through his little plan.

424
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,590
You know what?

425
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,550
Your grandpa does great calligraphy.

426
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,080
Of course.

427
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,880
He practiced calligraphy for dozens of years.

428
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,720
He certainly does great in it.

429
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,400
Your handwriting is good, too.

430
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,270
Is it genetic?

431
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,560
Yeah.

432
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,480
Practice more with me.

433
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,830
Maybe someday,

434
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,920
you'll also get Grandpa's gene.

435
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,030
Who will get his gene? Me?

436
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,910
Guess.

437
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,550
Don't make fun of me.

438
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,670
What are you looking at?

439
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,160
Your childhood photos are adorable.

440
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,590
You smiled brightly.

441
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,480
- Look.
- Grandaunt sent them?

442
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,510
She also told me

443
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,110
when you were in Germany,

444
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,000
you didn't tell anything to them.

445
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
I understand you.

446
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,160
But you can tell me if you're in trouble.

447
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,110
OK.

448
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,400
Are you sure she's the one?

449
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Yes.

450
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,310
This girl

451
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,790
is smart and proud.

452
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,750
She's very assertive.

453
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,550
Just like you.

454
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,920
She has a lot of merits

455
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,550
that I don't have.

456
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,720
You and Ji Xing

457
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,480
grew up

458
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,510
in totally different

459
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,440
living conditions.

460
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Your hobbies,

461
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
perspectives,

462
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,920
values,

463
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,400
and even love angles

464
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,240
are so different.

465
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,430
Of course.

466
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,550
This is the reason

467
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,640
you're attracted to each other now.

468
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,920
But as time goes by,

469
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,400
this is what will cause

470
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,510
contradictions between you.

471
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,160
We'll try hard to adjust.

472
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,350
Adjust?

473
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,310
How?

474
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,790
From what I can tell,

475
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,960
you have opposite tempers.

476
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
Once you have a problem,

477
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,200
one has to concede.

478
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,000
Which one of you will concede?

479
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,110
I will.

480
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,550
Don't blurt it out.

481
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,240
Think carefully before you talk.

482
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,270
No one is born to be a perfect couple.

483
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,030
I believe in our love.

484
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,790
(Poles Apart)
It's bad.

485
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
It won't be stamped.

486
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Not every piece of calligraphy is stamped.

487
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,760
Xing.

488
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,240
Actually, Hanhai is...

489
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,590
Who's that?

490
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,550
Chang He.

491
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
He said he wanted to invest in Xingchen

492
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,550
and would agree to cooperate with you.

493
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,110
He's funny.

494
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,670
What do you think?

495
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,400
You know it.

496
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,550
That's not going to happen.

497
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
He's your competitor.

498
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,200
If I cooperate with him,

499
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,750
I'll be betraying you.

500
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,110
I know this.

501
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,870
I'll go take a bath.

502
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Xing,

503
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,880
let's have a video chat

504
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
with your parents.

505
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,720
Tell them

506
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,630
we're in a relationship.

507
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
OK.

508
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,070
My darling daughter,

509
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,400
what's up?

510
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,720
Mom, is Dad with you now?

511
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,070
I'm with Han Ting.

512
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,240
He has something to tell you.

513
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,280
Wait a second.

514
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,310
Ji, come over.

515
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,270
Your daughter's calling.

516
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,190
How do I look?

517
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
Good.

518
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Han is also there.

519
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,280
Take it off.

520
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,190
Hurry.

521
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,520
OK. Good.

522
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,430
Mr. and Mrs. Ji,

523
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,550
Xing and I

524
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,510
have something to tell you.

525
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,000
What is it?

526
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,550
We're in a relationship.

527
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,510
Han Ting is my boyfriend.

528
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,400
We want to tell you officially.

529
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,110
I told you, huh?
I could tell it a long time ago.

530
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,030
It's good.

531
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,110
I'm so glad to know that.

532
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
Well, when are you coming back here?

533
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
Mr. and Mrs. Ji, we will go

534
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,030
during the Spring Festival.

535
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,720
Good. This is great.

536
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
By then,

537
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,240
have a good drink with me.

538
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,920
He said he couldn't drink.

539
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,480
Oh, my poor memory. That's right.

540
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,590
Fine, then.

541
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,750
I'll drink wine

542
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,110
and you'll drink beverages.

543
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,150
OK.

544
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,440
I'll drink with you, Dad.

545
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,960
So much for the talking.

546
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,750
I'll hang up. Love you.

547
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,750
Goodbye, Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

548
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,960
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

549
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,160
Now,

550
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,310
we've seen each other's parents.

551
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:04,950
Let's celebrate it.

552
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,960
What do you want for lunch?

553
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,510
The exhibition will be held tomorrow.

554
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,400
I have to prepare it properly

555
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
so that I can work out fine.

556
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,750
That's right. Well, Miss Ji,
focus on your work.

557
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,000
I'll take care of lunch.

558
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,780
(Dongyang Group)

559
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,280
Ms. Yuan.

560
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
Yang Qiong has got some news.

561
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,950
What did he say?

562
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,310
He told me he had talked

563
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,320
with some people who were close to Mr. Han.

564
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,110
He got to know when Chen Ningyang

565
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,680
started Hanhai six years ago,

566
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,240
he stayed in Germany for a while.

567
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,270
During that time, he met Mr. Han frequently.

568
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,550
Following this clue,

569
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,390
I did an investigation.

570
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,550
Since Mr. Han

571
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,920
took over Dongyang Medical,

572
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,840
there have been
close technical communications with Hanhai.

573
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,270
This is the list of technical exchanges

574
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,780
between our product department and Hanhai.

575
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,760
(Technical Projects
of Dongyang Medical&amp;Hanhai Technology)

576
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,260
(R&amp;D Technical Report)

577
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,590
Ms. Yuan,

578
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,920
you summoned me in such a hurry.

579
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,750
What happened?

580
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,200
How's your plan going

581
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,310
with Xingchen?

582
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,760
Oh, Xingchen.

583
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,750
It's under the control of Han Ting.

584
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,790
Ji Xing doesn't make a single decision

585
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,550
without his permission.

586
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,080
By the way,

587
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,880
I texted her last night.

588
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,720
She hasn't texted back yet.

589
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,440
I got a clue.

590
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,350
What is it?

591
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,390
Miss Zeng.

592
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,200
Yuan.

593
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,750
Miss Zeng, take your seat.

594
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,870
It's OK.

595
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,920
We're in the same boat.

596
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,880
Oh, Di.

597
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
Yesterday, Han Ting took Ji Xing

598
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,310
to meet my grandpa at home.

599
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
He did?

600
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,030
He can take anyone home

601
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,160
as he wishes.

602
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,720
What does it have to do with me?

603
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,270
In this case,

604
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,400
why did you refuse

605
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,790
to take back the shares of Guanghua

606
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,510
when Han Ting offered to withdraw?

607
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,070
Take them back.

608
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
Mr. Chang.

609
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,000
She is still too young.

610
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Help her as far as you can.

611
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,790
You don't have to say that.

612
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,160
I certainly want to help her.

613
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
But I can't do that

614
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,960
unless I have a qualification and spot.

615
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,800
Am I right?

616
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,480
Ms. Yuan,

617
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,310
you were interrupted.

618
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,790
You said you had a clue.

619
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
What is it?

620
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I figured out

621
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Luo Ping, handler of our new product lines,

622
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,240
had very frequent
technical communications with Hanhai.

623
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
Later, I contacted an old employee
who was deployed

624
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,370
to Dongyang Base in Germany.

625
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,240
As early as six years ago,

626
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,510
when Han Ting was in Germany,

627
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,310
he had a close relationship

628
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,790
with the founders of Hanhai.

629
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,640
In terms of funds

630
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,550
as well as techniques,

631
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,310
he greatly supported them.

632
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,440
If Hanhai belongs to Han Ting...

633
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
Hanhai and Xingchen

634
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,500
basically do the same business.

635
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,200
And Hanhai has been

636
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,720
the best company in this field.

637
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,110
Why did he invest in Xingchen?

638
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,440
So, Han Ting has been

639
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,510
taking Xingchen as his smokescreen.

640
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,440
He's confusing you, Ms. Yuan.

641
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,550
No wonder he could

642
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,270
make such a pledge.

643
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,400
A big game, indeed.

644
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,830
Since he uses Xingchen as a pawn,

645
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,430
how about...?

646
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,200
How about we start our plan

647
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,920
with Xingchen?

648
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,910
Good idea.

649
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,630
Cheers.

650
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,950
Cheers, Ms. Yuan.

651
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
Cheers, Ms. Yuan.

652
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,620
(Exhibitor)

653
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,590
Hanhai's booth of the Pioneer Project

654
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,430
looks really imposing.

655
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,070
They stole the thunder.

656
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,510
The public opinion of Huang Weiwei's case

657
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,400
has affected us

658
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,350
more or less.

659
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,350
Look on the bright side.

660
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,310
This time, we have a bigger booth

661
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,150
than that in Shenzhen,

662
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,000
don't we?

663
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
You're right, Xing.

664
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,350
Anyway, we have backup

665
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,440
from Dongyang Medical and Mr. Han.

666
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,310
Exceeding Hanhai

667
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,150
is just a matter of time.

668
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,150
Ji Xing.

669
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,480
Miss Zeng.

670
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,750
Do you have time?

671
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,590
Go get prepared

672
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,640
for the booth this afternoon.

673
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,270
Ask Shang to prepare

674
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,200
more brochures.

675
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,190
OK.

676
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,510
Xingchen has developed so fast

677
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,920
in such a short time.

678
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,240
You're awesome, indeed.

679
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,590
Thanks.

680
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,750
This isn't your whole point, is it?

681
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,720
Now, you sound really tough.

682
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,640
You think you beat me, huh?

683
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,350
Guanghua works on medical robots

684
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,480
while Xingchen works

685
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,720
on 3D medical printing.

686
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,350
We may cooperate.

687
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,830
Yet we don't compete.

688
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,510
There's no such thing as "beat".

689
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,590
You haven't been with Han Ting for a long time,

690
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,440
but you talk like him now.

691
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,350
I grew up with him,

692
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,510
but I still don't speak like him.

693
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
At this point,

694
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,350
you beat me.

695
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
If you don't mind,

696
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,750
I should go.

697
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,920
You think you know Han Ting very well, huh?

698
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,400
Xingchen develops well.

699
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,510
But it isn't as good as Hanhai.

700
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,710
Not because your techniques are poor,

701
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,480
but because Hanhai

702
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,960
got the support of a big shot

703
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,630
much earlier than you did.

704
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,110
Even when Han Ting was in Germany,

705
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,400
he invested in Hanhai.

706
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,590
When he was just back in China,

707
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
he had a shaky foundation.

708
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,920
Han Yuan could have a lot of ways

709
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,550
to stop him merge Hanhai.

710
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,710
Then he made a pledge,

711
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,230
buying himself some time
to reform Dongyang Medical

712
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,510
and make preparations for Hanhai's merger.

713
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,670
As for Xingchen...

714
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,880
It's just a smokescreen.

715
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,030
When his pledge is fulfilled,

716
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,840
whether Xingchen will live

717
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,710
or whether it will collapse

718
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,590
depends on his mood alone.

719
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,990
Of course,

720
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,110
it also depends on how much he loves you.

721
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,550
When you please him,

722
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,710
he'll spare you.

723
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,510
But if you annoy him,

724
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,710
he'll destroy you.

725
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,550
You don't need to turn me against him.

726
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,070
Even if he has invested in Hanhai,

727
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,110
that is his own business.

728
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,800
It's such an important thing.

729
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,960
But he didn't tell you?

730
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,960
I thought

731
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,360
he would tell you everything.

732
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,920
You think you know a lot about him, huh?

733
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
Very well.

734
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
If really you knew a lot about him,

735
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,150
considering your temper,

736
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,800
you wouldn't have been with him.

737
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,230
He's a very nice guy,

738
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,160
isn't he?

739
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,710
Women can hardly say no to him.

740
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,240
But...

741
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,070
You...

742
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,070
You're simple.

743
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Haven't you wondered

744
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,230
what can make you good for him?

745
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,710
What does he like in you?

746
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,160
Your simplicity?

747
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,120
Ji Xing,

748
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
when you get a tempting gift from destiny,

749
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,190
all you do is open it happily.

750
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,360
You've never thought

751
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,800
when you accept this gift,

752
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,360
you will have to pay a price.

753
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,680
(You...)

754
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,950
(You're simple.)

755
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,110
(Haven't you wondered)

756
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,550
(what can make you good for him?)

757
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,150
(What does he like in you?)

758
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,910
(Your simplicity?)

759
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,440
You freaked me out.

760
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,630
When did you get back?

761
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
What happened?

762
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,030
At today's exhibition,

763
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,190
I realized that Hanhai was developing too fast.

764
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,480
Xingchen is no match for it.

765
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,070
Hanhai stably developed

766
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,960
for five or six years

767
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,550
before it came this far.

768
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,000
Xingchen is developing fast enough.

769
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,070
Many other companies can't catch up.

770
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,280
But when Xingchen is trying to catch up,

771
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
Hanhai will not stop.

772
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,920
What is the matter?

773
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,550
When you met Grandpa last time,

774
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,630
didn't you say Hanhai

775
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:37,510
wasn't your goal

776
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,070
and you would go your own way?

777
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,320
It's just an exhibition.

778
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,800
Hanhai made you confused again?

779
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,920
One day, when Hanhai is powerful enough,

780
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,910
will it...?

781
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,150
Will it annex Xingchen?

782
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,550
Xingchen plans to go its own way.

783
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,670
But someday, will it

784
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,670
have nowhere to go?

785
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,360
The market needs Hanhai.

786
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,150
It needs Xingchen, too.

787
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,070
You don't need to compare.

788
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,440
I know Xingchen is your hard work.

789
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,110
I will protect it.

790
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,390
Han Ting.

791
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,360
Do you love me?

792
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,510
How do you define love?

793
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
You'll die for me.

794
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,440
Without me, your world will collapse.

795
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,320
That's not the love I understand.

796
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,760
What is your definition, then?

797
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,440
First, match.

798
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,160
Xing,

799
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,840
"match" isn't a pathetic word.

800
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,510
"Love" isn't noble, either.

801
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,360
It's hard to find the right person.

802
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,030
It requires a perfect match

803
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,710
of values, time,

804
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,760
spirit, and soul.

805
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,070
I'm tired.

806
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,480
I'll go take a bath.
