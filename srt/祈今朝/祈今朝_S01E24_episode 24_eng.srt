1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,500
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,800
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,400
   

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
   

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
   

21
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
I sensed it.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,600
The Luo family indeed has the mouth of the spring.

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,300
Please excuse my manners.

24
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,600
I wonder why you have come.

25
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,900
Don't play dumb. Hand over the key ring of Rehai.

26
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,500
All right then.

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,300
I will if you can touch it.

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,400
What big talk!

29
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Your Lordship.

30
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,253
 He can block Her Lordship's attack! 

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,500
Within the territory of Rehai, no one can harm me.

32
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,900
The key ring of Rehai is a treasure of the Six Realms and is incredibly valuable.

33
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,100
How would I possibly hand it over?

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Here comes the one...

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,200
who's meant to come.

36
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
Commander Ying, you are very well informed.

37
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,600
We've just arrived, and you came immediately.

38
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,300
It concerns Rehai. I had to come.

39
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,400
Commander Ying, I've heard a lot about you.

40
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
You've all come from afar.

41
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,700
Tea has been prepared. Please follow me.

42
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,600
How is it? Any news on Lang Mo?

43
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,600
   

44
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,700
We only know he is in a village called Mangwan in the Western Regions.

45
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,200
No other news for now.

46
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,400
We must not delay. Let's change our course to Mangwan Village.

47
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,800
Young Xiu,

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,400
go back to Mount Yuqing to hold vigil for Brother Hanjiang.

49
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,600
Leave the matters of Mangwan Village to us.

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,400
Rest assured.

51
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Okay. I'll stay with Master.

52
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,100
Me... and me too.

53
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,200
I'll stay to keep Miss Ming company.

54
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,100
Besides...

55
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,400
Besides... I want to hold vigil for Senior Gu, too.

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
- Good. 
 - No need.

57
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Young Shifang, if Young Xiu gets angry, just coax her.

58
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,700
If she is unhappy and hits you, just tolerate it.

59
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,000
My punches really hurt.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm tough. I'm not afraid.

61
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,500
Young Xiu, you've really grown up.

62
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm happy and yet somewhat sad.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Hall Leader Ju and I will ride Lingxiao there.

64
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,400
You keep the Yunlai Stone.

65
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,300
If anything happens,

66
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,100
send a paper crane to me.

67
00:07:13,253 --> 00:07:14,733
Well...

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,500
It doesn't matter who keeps it.

69
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,300
We're family.

70
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:25,973
Okay.

71
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Now that we're done saying goodbye,

72
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,100
I'll go tell Jinzhao and Young Yue we're setting off.

73
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,600
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

74
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,100
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

75
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,600
♫  Would it be the joy or penetrating sorrow from the years?  ♫

76
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,900
♫  What do I hear?   ♫

77
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,600
♫  The laughter running through the Milky Way  ♫

78
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,200
♫  My heart remembers who you are  ♫

79
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:21,316
    
 ♫  Grasping this short happiness over and over again  ♫

80
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:24,356
♫  Unable to ask you to stay with me  ♫

81
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:28,720
♫  The stories force me to sit with my regrets, to try and reconcile  ♫

82
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,713
 Master, 

83
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:34,412
 after the funeral customs, I will go to them. 

84
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,113
 They helped me without reserve. 

85
00:08:39,013 --> 00:08:40,696
 I want to help them, too. 

86
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,300
♫  I asked fate to steal the answer to the riddle  ♫

87
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,900
♫  If I use this in exchange, could you not leave?  ♫

88
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,500
♫  I had you, yet lost you  ♫

89
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,200
♫  Only to redefine our reunion  ♫

90
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:03,990
   

91
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,960
This is the Xiangzhen Forest.

92
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,000
Beyond the forest, there's a village up ahead.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,100
It must be the Mangwan Village.

94
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:28,833
Jinzhao, what is this? How can you see so far?

95
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:31,480
This is a spyglass.

96
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,800
It's made according to ancient designs.

97
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,500
You can try.

98
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,900
I can't see anything at all.

99
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,900
You need to twist it. Then it becomes clearer.

100
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,600
I see it! I see it!

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
- I really can see very far. 
 - Do you like it?

102
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,600
The device made by Shifang is very exquisite.

103
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,539
When we go back, I'll ask Young Shifang to make one for you.

104
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,500
Look, Jinzhao. Isn't that Lang Mo?

105
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes, it's really Lang Mo.

106
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,600
Let's go.

107
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,700
You really came.

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Luo Maiming, hand over the key ring of Rehai now!

109
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
I can hand it over,

110
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,400
but I want to see who makes the offer that aligns more with my desire.

111
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,400
What I want is the method to lift the Rehai Bloodbinding.

112
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Do either of you have it?

113
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't have it.

114
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,732
He does.

115
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
I do have it.

116
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,700
But why should I tell you?

117
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,400
Ying Xuwei,

118
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,100
Mist Soul is still in the Core of the Demon Realm.

119
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:40,653
Since I won't be told the method to lift Bloodbinding,

120
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll hand over Rehai to Her Lordship

121
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,500
so Her Lordship can absorb it at will. How about that?

122
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,100
Young Master Luo,

123
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,000
are you threatening me?

124
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,700
How could I?

125
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,300
I just want you to stay

126
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,300
so we will have a good discussion.

127
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,600
Once a large amount of energy is drained from the mouth of the spring,

128
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,500
it'll inevitably threaten the Six Realms.

129
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,700
We've all got people we care about in this world,

130
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,000
and none of us want to see such things happen.

131
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,000
I can tell you the unbinding method,

132
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,800
but my condition is that I'll keep the key ring of Rehai later.

133
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
I agree.

134
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500
The day the Bloodbinding is successfully lifted,

135
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,200
I will personally present the key ring to you, Commander Ying.

136
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,600
It's you guys who saved me. Sorry about that.

137
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,532
You are Master Luo!

138
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,700
Yes.

139
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,000
Previously, due to some reasons,

140
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,800
I had to disguise as a man.

141
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Lang Mo, were you hunting for prey just now?

142
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,000
Correct. I'm looking for a demon beast.

143
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,000
Others avoid demon beasts at all costs.

144
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Why do you seek them out on purpose?

145
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,873
It's a long story.

146
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,400
Before, in the Luori Village,

147
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,600
Master Luo used the treasures seized from the Qiyuan Sect

148
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,900
as our travel money back home.

149
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,200
I saw a beautiful pearl,

150
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,300
so I brought it back for my wife, Yu Xiang.

151
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,300
 It's so pretty. 

152
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,800
 Put it on me. 

153
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
 It's truly lovely. 

154
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,100
But who would know, after Yu Xiang put it on,

155
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,800
the Qiyuan Orb fused into her body?

156
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Ever since then,

157
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,200
she's been getting weaker and weaker.

158
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,500
I seek demon beasts,

159
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,900
hoping to get a demon beast's inner orb to prolong Yu Xiang's life.

160
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,700
The Qiyuan Orb?

161
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
That's right.

162
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Are you here for the Qiyuan Orb?

163
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
Then do you know the method to remove it?

164
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:25,893
Could you take us to take a look at her?

165
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,400
This way, please.

166
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,932
Zhu Yu.

167
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,800
You've got plenty of Qiyuan Orbs.

168
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,700
Why insist on obtaining Rehai?

169
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,800
The Qiyuan Orbs come from humans.

170
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,200
The Vitality Energy in them is imbued with the dark emotions of humans,

171
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,600
far less pure than that of Rehai.

172
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Nowadays, I often feel like a stranger to myself.

173
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,100
Healing my clan before I lose my sanity

174
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,800
is the most prudent way I can think of.

175
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,200
Taking your clan into the time stasis is the most prudent way.

176
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,600
That's just sacrificing our clan in exchange for what you call safety.

177
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
How is that prudent?

178
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,800
You're afraid you can't control me.

179
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:26,692
You decided to use my daughter to scheme against me, did you not?

180
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:30,793
When the time comes, even if I lose my sanity,

181
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:33,333
what will you be afraid of?

182
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,310
   

183
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
This way, please.

184
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,900
Yu Xiang.

185
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Yu Xiang. Yu Xiang.

186
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,100
Do you still remember Master Luo, the one who saved us?

187
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,500
She's here.

188
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,000
Yu Xiang.

189
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:18,472
Yu Xiang.

190
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,333
She's been like this for so long,

191
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:35,112
subsisting on the herbs I gather and the inner orbs of demon beasts I hunt.

192
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,000
It's all my fault. It's all because of me...

193
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:50,613
that Yu Xiang ended up like this.

194
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,200
Sir, please save her.

195
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,500
Jinzhao, they are so pitiful.

196
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,800
Let's save her.

197
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,900
We will, but not now.

198
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm sorry. She's beyond help.

199
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,333
She can't be saved?

200
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,600
Not even you can save her?

201
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,473
Yu Xiang.

202
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry, Lang Mo.

203
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,300
If I had found this Qiyuan Orb that day...

204
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Zhaoyan, don't blame yourself.

205
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,600
Don't, Zhaoyan. It's not your fault.

206
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
Could you please leave?

207
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,100
I have to make medicine for Yu Xiang.

208
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Brother Lang, may I ask you a question?

209
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,800
Third Brother, why is there no movement at all over there?

210
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Will Lang Mo really make a move on them?

211
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
For his wife, he will.

212
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,700
This time, thanks to Second Sister's persuasion,

213
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,400
Eldest Brother allowed the two of us to monitor him together.

214
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Otherwise, it'd be so boring for you alone.

215
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,800
It's not just surveillance.

216
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,100
I know. We'll also take them back to the Yujie Hub.

217
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,300
But, Third Brother, why do we suddenly have to capture them?

218
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Xiaoyuan, do you know we're not doing good things?

219
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,400
I know. So what?

220
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
No matter what you guys do, I'll help.

221
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,972
Why did you hit me again?

222
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,672
Precisely because we are not doing good deeds but you don't care.

223
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:21,412
This is what Eldest Brother, Second Sister, and I least want to see.

224
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:25,272
Although we're doing bad things, it is to protect the Six Realms.

225
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:27,232
How awesome!

226
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,792
Xiaoyuan, no matter what,

227
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,073
doing evil is wrong.

228
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:39,813
We shouldn't feel superior.

229
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:44,252
Sacrificing so many innocent people to achieve what we believe,

230
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:46,650
we're the ones to be condemned.

231
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,293
But it doesn't concern you.

232
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:52,112
When we return, I'll let Eldest Brother give you a good lesson again.

233
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,853
I don't want that.

234
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,113
What about this? Do you want it?

235
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:05,633
I want a butterfly. It's prettier.

236
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,753
Picky.

237
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:19,288
Lang Mo, my condolences.

238
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:21,933
It will pass.

239
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:24,253
Where are you going?

240
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,892
There is a grassland in front of the village.

241
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:32,652
Yu Xiang used to spend a lot of time there looking at the scenery.

242
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,532
Let's go.

243
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:51,573
They're here. Let's go.

244
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,252
Everyone, sorry about this.

245
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:36,693
Qi.

246
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:40,573
Qi.

247
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,873
Come out.

248
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,432
Bian Luohuan.

249
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,708
Third Brother, hurry up.

250
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:05,844
The people you want are already here. How do I remove the Qiyuan Orb?

251
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,713
I'll help you with it.

252
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,619
Third Brother, watch out!

253
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,433
It seems that Lang Mo had already told you.

254
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:48,032
How can you go back on your word?

255
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:53,773
 Brother Lang, may I ask you a question? 

256
00:24:56,933 --> 00:25:00,173
 How did you know it was called the Qiyuan Orb? 

257
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:03,753
 That's right. This is a remote place. 

258
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,690
 How did you know of it? 

259
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:10,013
 And at that time you said, "You really came." 

260
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:12,053
 Later, you mentioned the Qiyuan Orb. 

261
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:17,252
 It seems someone from the Qiyuan Sect had told you earlier that we would come. 

262
00:25:18,032 --> 00:25:19,693
 Well... 

263
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,653
 Their headquarters have been destroyed. 

264
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,612
 What's left are just some sorry stragglers. 

265
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:27,680
 It's unlikely for them to spread to this place. 

266
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:30,652
 Is it Bian Luohuan and his cohorts? 

267
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:33,273
 Is it or not? 

268
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:39,013
 All of you saved my life. 

269
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,040
 I'm very grateful. 

270
00:25:41,892 --> 00:25:43,412
 But this concerns the life of Yu Xiang. 

271
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,952
 We know how to remove the Qiyuan Orb. 

272
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,710
 Really? 

273
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:55,073
 But didn't you just say she couldn't be saved? 

274
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:58,532
 Let me try and you'll know. 

275
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:37,852
 Yu Xiang. 

276
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:43,052
 I-I-It's really been taken out. 

277
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:51,012
 Brother Lang, we need you to help us put on an act. 

278
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:59,993
Third Brother, stop wasting words with them. Just grab them and go.

279
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:29,913
- Yu Xiang. 
 - Lang Mo.

280
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:54,693
It's all your fault.

281
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:56,673
Run.

282
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:10,532
What were you sneaking around for just now?

283
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:19,333
Forget it. You'd just lie even if I asked.

284
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,052
You've remembered it all.

285
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,993
When you were at Fengyan Inn,

286
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:30,093
I asked you if you were my master, but you denied it.

287
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,772
I'm sorry.

288
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:35,092
I couldn't tell you at the time.

289
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,039
How about in Luori Village?

290
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,252
At Luo Mansion.

291
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:46,252
Jing'an. Qiyuan's headquarters.

292
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:52,852
You had so many chances but you never planned to tell me.

293
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:58,532
Even now, you're still hiding it from me.

294
00:29:03,613 --> 00:29:05,133
I...

295
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:23,293
You were drugging me?

296
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,052
Jinzhao.

297
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,853
 Oh, no. I've got no strength left. 

298
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,172
Come on.

299
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:07,133
Come here. Let's keep fighting.

300
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:13,412
Don't use your inner strength, or you'll risk a backlash.

301
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,860
Let go of me!

302
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,181
Jinzhao.

303
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,420
Jinzhao!

304
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:50,073
Are you seeking death?

305
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:57,604
Jinzhao!

306
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,112
Qi.

307
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,373
Third Brother!

308
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,732
Qi.

309
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:56,424
Third Brother. Third Brother!

310
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,221
Qi.

311
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,581
Third Brother. Third Brother.

312
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:04,000
Third Brother, are you all right?

313
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,528
Third Brother.

314
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:08,661
Third Brother. Wait, I'll go avenge you.

315
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:15,620
Xiaoyuan, take Yue Jinzhao and Yue Qi away and don't hurt them.

316
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:21,152
Third Brother. Third Brother!

317
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,233
 No other choice. 

318
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:29,616
Xian Qing. Xian Qing!

319
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:36,816
You, and you, come with me.

320
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:48,143
What are you doing? Looking for a beating?

321
00:32:48,143 --> 00:32:52,037
If you take one more step forward, I will kill him.

322
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:56,980
Do you want to bring back a dead man now or capture a live one later?

323
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,016
- It's up to you. 
 - You're lying. Aren't you friends?

324
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:03,896
I am a demon.

325
00:33:03,896 --> 00:33:08,036
Do you want to see if a demon thinks like a human?

326
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,117
Make your decision.

327
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:21,556
Bian Luohuan might not hold on much longer with his injuries.

328
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:23,524
Darn you!

329
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,696
Qi.

330
00:34:24,076 --> 00:34:25,696
Qi.

331
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:31,377
Qi. Qi.

332
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,237
Xian Qing.

333
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:01,976
We will return to Mount Yuqing immediately.

334
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:14,448
Master Luo.

335
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Thank you for saving Yu Xiang today.

336
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:38,317
Though it's not a panacea, I hope it can help ease his pain a little.

337
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,021
Thank you.

338
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:52,916
Has Brother Yue woken up?

339
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,737
He's still unconscious.

340
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:58,837
What's on your mind?

341
00:37:00,157 --> 00:37:04,476
I am thinking, our visit to that village was completely impromptu.

342
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:07,456
How did Bian Luohuan learn about it?

343
00:37:08,756 --> 00:37:10,376
Do you have any ideas?

344
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:15,217
I asked the disciples of my family to secretly investigate Lang Mo's whereabouts.

345
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:17,737
Only one can access the report.

346
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,877
It's Maiming.

347
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:28,996
So you suspect it was Luo Maiming who informed Bian Luohuan?

348
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,457
I do not know.

349
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:38,816
I thought I knew Maiming very well, but now I realize...

350
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:42,637
I don't really know him.

351
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:45,176
Let's go to the Luo Mansion...

352
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:49,436
and figure out everything.

353
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,157
Bian Luohuan took Qi back to the Yujie Hub.

354
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,376
If Luo Maiming is truly in cahoots with Bian Luohuan,

355
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:57,376
perhaps he knows where the Yujie Hub is.

356
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,777
You might not know it.

357
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,057
Maiming can take the energy of Rehai for his own use.

358
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:08,576
Then within the territory of Rehai, no one can beat him.

359
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,537
So what?

360
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:14,697
Even if I have to go against Heaven, I'm determined to find Qi.

361
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:27,000


362
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,415
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

363
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,387
