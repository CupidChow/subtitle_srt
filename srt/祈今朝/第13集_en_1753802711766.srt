6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you, Miss Ming.

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thanks to your bell, we can escape.

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Jin Zhao

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Jin Zhao

10
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Two... Two Jin Zhao

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Jin

12
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jin Zhao

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We...

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, I'll take you to rest.

15
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Jin Zhao, let's find a place to rest.

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go.

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I, Gao Xiao, pay my respects to Lord Sheng Xuan.

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's the matter?

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Lord, in the Five Alliance today,

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I saw another group of ghosts and the one who was never gone.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And the one who killed Zhen Yao with one shot.

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Lord Sheng Xuan, the Five Alliance is the best sect in the world.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If those ghosts and ghosts work together,

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm afraid they'll be a great help to me.

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But Gao Xiao is a little bit of a master.

26
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He asked someone to change his image.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If the Five Alliance knows that there are ghosts in that group of ghosts,

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then the relationship between them will be a long story.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it's you.

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Gao Xiao.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You've done a great job.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will help you to take over the sect.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you, Lord Sheng Xuan.

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Lord Sheng Xuan, I will do my best

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
to repay your kindness.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please excuse me.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Gao Xiao, I'll write this account for you.

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:07,140
And keep the

40
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,020
Thank you for today.

41
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,980
Otherwise,

42
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,940
no one would know

43
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,260
the true face of the Fallen.

44
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,100
Besides,

45
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,620
no one cares about

46
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,660
your identity.

47
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,060
That's what they think.

48
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,980
Of course.

49
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,940
Although you're a wolf demon,

50
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,020
you're a popular ancient road.

51
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,780
You're...

52
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,860
You're very nice to us.

53
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,060
You're very helpful.

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,140
You...

55
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,100
What do you think?

56
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,340
You're a very

57
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,900
loyal friend and brother to me.

58
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,460
Brother?

59
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,220
Fine.

60
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,140
If you don't mind I'm a demon,

61
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,100
I'm glad.

62
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,660
I

63
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,540
wanted to

64
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,520
give it to you before.

65
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,480
Thank you.

66
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,580
It's only this hairpin

67
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,220
that can be given to a woman.

68
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
As a present,

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,940
is what women use.

70
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,220
You know it now?

71
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,740
Yes.

72
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,420
Just like you know I'm a monster.

73
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,340
Senior.

74
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,900
Zhang Yan.

75
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,860
I...

76
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,460
Senior Xing Jing.

77
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,220
Let me...

78
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,740
Sorry.

79
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,580
Sorry.

80
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,780
Well...

81
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,740
I put it here.

82
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,020
Well,

83
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,020
please continue.

84
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Grandpa Zhao is my savior.

85
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,740
He's not too much

86
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,900
for a hairpin.

87
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,180
But he also has a big brother.

88
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,300
This means

89
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:51,100
he will be in charge of this Ben

90
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
and bells.

91
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,300
Mr. Shang,

92
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,980
we're sour.

93
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,180
I want to be my other half

94
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,820
I will never look at anyone else's face

95
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,660
again!

96
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,900
It's just that he is having a scar on his face.

97
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,060
The mere sight of the Handswwwith from Qiyuan Sect

98
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,000
looks very much like me now.

99
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,460
Don't tell me that I look like you?

100
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,540
Is it right for us

101
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,880
to investigate Qiyuan Sect

102
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,620
just to be a joke?

103
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,580
What Jinzhao said was wrong.

104
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,980
Even though he is the sw carga of this world,

105
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,520
More on own than hers.

106
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,100
You're also warmer than her.

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,980
What's the matter?

108
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,040
Get some sleep.

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
What's wrong?

110
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Qi.

111
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Do you know what's wrong with these scales?

112
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Why are they growing again?

113
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Again?

114
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Before, in the Fujin Hall,

115
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
after the new King of the Seven Spirits was born,

116
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
it has grown.

117
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
But it disappeared very quickly.

118
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
I didn't notice it.

119
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
It seems that I was right

120
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
in the Fujin Hall.

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
I grew in the Fujin Hall too.

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Qi.

123
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Actually,

124
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
don't you think

125
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
this scale is pretty good?

126
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
It's pretty good.

127
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
So,

128
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
don't worry.

129
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
You must remember

130
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
not to show the scales to anyone.

131
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Don't tell anyone.

132
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Can't I tell them?

133
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Aren't they our good friends?

134
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Only good friends can't make them worry.

135
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
After we find the evidence,

136
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
we'll tell them, okay?

137
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Okay.

138
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,040
The Fujin Hall

139
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Do you know your mistake?

140
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
It's my fault

141
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
that Yue Qingzhao took off the mask.

142
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
But I won't regret it.

143
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Qi.

144
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Xiao Huan.

145
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Boss.

146
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Xiao Huan did it for the sake of the old flag.

147
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
So he...

148
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
If you want to get rid of it,

149
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
you must get rid of it.

150
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Then you won't see the real face.

151
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
According to the rules of the Taoism School,

152
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
those who know the mistake will be punished.

153
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Those who know the mistake

154
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
will be punished by thunder.

155
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
The Taoism School

156
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Brother.

157
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Yue.

158
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Don't go.

159
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
If you go now,

160
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
you'll be punished by me.

161
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
You'll be punished by His Highness.

162
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Yes.

163
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
It's done.

164
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
I want to find my Huan,

165
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
and take back the BenAge.

166
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
How about you?

167
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
You did well.

168
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Cao Hu oversight this time.

169
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Master.

170
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
This time,

171
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,320
I was wronged.

172
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,160
I admit all my mistakes.

173
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,040
You just admit it.

174
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
You don't admit it at all.

175
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,360
The one who is connected to Qi now

176
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,680
is Yue Jinzhao.

177
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
You didn't fall into the trap.

178
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Yue Jinzhao was born because of you.

179
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
For Qi,

180
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,960
you are the past.

181
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
He is the future.

182
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,960
When will you understand?

183
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
You are the past.

184
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,160
You are the future.

185
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,160
You are the future.

186
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
You are the future.

187
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
You are the future.

188
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
You are the future.

189
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
You are the future.

190
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
When will you understand?

191
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,360
I always understand.

192
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,160
But

193
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
I don't believe it.

194
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Brother.

195
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,960
Jinliang.

196
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,360
Don't go there.

197
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Boss.

198
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Please.

199
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
Let Xiaohuan go, okay?

200
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,560
It's not that I don't want to let her go.

201
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,760
She doesn't want to let herself go.

202
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,960
Third.

203
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,360
I ask you again.

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,560
Do you know your mistake?

205
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
I was wrong.

206
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
How can I know?

207
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Xiaohuan.

208
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Xiaohuan.

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Brother.

210
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,560
Xiaohuan.

211
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Are you okay?

212
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
Xiaohuan.

213
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,960
I'm okay.

214
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,360
You lied to me.

215
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,160
You are blinded by thunder.

216
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,560
How could you be okay?

217
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,760
Brother.

218
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,360
You lied to me about this.

219
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,760
Why can't you professionalize it?

220
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,360
Because you have no point.

221
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
Is that true?

222
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,560
What did I tell you?

223
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
This is my philosophy.

224
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
How many kinds of topics do you take?

225
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,960
We guys are later.

226
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Super。

227
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,960
When will you tell me?

228
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Xianqing.

229
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,840
I'll be Xianqing too.

230
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,600
Yue, you should take revenge for me.

231
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,080
Of course.

232
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,520
Jinzhao and I have made a deal.

233
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,640
We'll eliminate Qi Yuan Zong this time.

234
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,840
Everyone,

235
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,320
about me and Bian Luohua,

236
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,520
Jinzhao,

237
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,080
you are you, he is he.

238
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,240
We can tell.

239
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,520
Thank you.

240
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,600
But you and Bian Luohua

241
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
look like twins.

242
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
We may not be able to tell

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,280
your looks.

244
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,360
But I...

245
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,960
But we know

246
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,160
you and Bian Luohua are different.

247
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Let's think about what to do next.

248
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,720
When we were in Fujin Hall,

249
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,920
Qi Yuan Zong said that

250
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
Shengxun wanted to catch us.

251
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,520
Then in the Fengyan Hall,

252
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,240
they pointed out that Bian Luohua is Shengxun.

253
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,920
I've been suspecting that

254
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,600
Bian Luohua was deliberately

255
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,720
trying to frame Qi and me.

256
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
But I don't know

257
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,840
what the purpose is.

258
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,480
Then let's continue to investigate Qi Yuan Zong

259
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,720
and get Bian Luohua out.

260
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,200
Yes.

261
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,920
So far, we only have the clue of the crystal stone.

262
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,400
And the crystal stone is in Qi Yuan Zong's machine-gun box.

263
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,560
So it must be related to Qi Yuan Zong.

264
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,440
He also appeared in the Wuyian Village

265
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
where Qi and I woke up.

266
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,480
And I look like Bian Luohua.

267
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,200
Jinzhao,

268
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,640
why don't we go to the Wuyian Village

269
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,120
and ask Grandma Shi directly?

270
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,600
Yue has really grown up.

271
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,280
How is Third Brother?

272
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,720
He has taken the medicine and fell asleep.

273
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,320
Actually,

274
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
Third Brother is not easy.

275
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,560
At that time, he asked Tian Qingzhi

276
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,840
to give the flag to us

277
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,840
for the purpose of curing the rain.

278
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
But he didn't.

279
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
He didn't.

280
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,480
He didn't.

281
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,280
He didn't.

282
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,080
He didn't.

283
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,880
He didn't.

284
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,640
He didn't.

285
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
He didn't.

286
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,280
He didn't.

287
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,040
He didn't.

288
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,840
He didn't.

289
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,680
He didn't.

290
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,600
Xiao Huan has been with him for more than ten years.

291
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
He has been patient

292
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,040
and carefully taking care of him.

293
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,840
That's because Qi

294
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,600
only wants to be close to him.

295
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,360
After Qi disappeared,

296
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
when he came back again,

297
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,200
there was Yue Jinzhao by his side.

298
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,440
At that time, you thought

299
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,080
Yue Jinzhao

300
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,000
and Qi's relationship was much bigger than Xiao Huan.

301
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,360
So you let them stay in the mortal world.

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,800
In this way,

303
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,480
Xiao Huan will always be replaced.

304
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
That can't be the reason for him to break the cocoon.

305
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,800
Xiao Huan is not a person

306
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,280
who is willing to do whatever he wants.

307
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,200
He can accept it.

308
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,000
But

309
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,080
he will be a little reluctant.

310
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,560
I still hope

311
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,720
you don't blame him.

312
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,800
I will never blame you.

313
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,800
You have to know

314
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
that I will never blame you.

315
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,040
Well.

316
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,680
I see.

317
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
He won't do it.

318
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,520
Is this a dream?

319
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
What's wrong?

320
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,760
Didn't you say that

321
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Zhao Yan and Xian Qing...

322
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,520
Anyway, they're really...

323
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah.

324
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,200
You...

325
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,720
You don't think they're...

326
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Matches.

327
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Xiaoyue.

328
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,120
But we're good friends.

329
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,000
What do you mean by that?

330
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Shi Fang.

331
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,680
I mean, they're a good match.

332
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,040
Is Zhao Yan still hesitating?

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,080
Should we tell everyone that you're a girl?

334
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,440
I'm used to the male world.

335
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,880
If I confess my feelings,

336
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,440
it'll be hard.

337
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,880
But we're friends.

338
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,240
I shouldn't hide it.

339
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's go.

340
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Miss Yi Yue.

341
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Miss Yi Yue.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Shi Fang.

343
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Actually...

345
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
Actually, I'm a girl.

346
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,120
Your child's clothes are so pretty.

347
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,640
Zhao Yan, try them on.

348
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,120
I misunderstood you and Xian Qing.

349
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,600
It's...

350
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,520
But it doesn't seem like a misunderstanding.

351
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
No, no.

352
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
It's a misunderstanding.

353
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
It's not a misunderstanding.

354
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,280
It's not a misunderstanding.

355
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,160
But you were...

356
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,360
Shi Fang, let's go.

357
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,680
You're talking nonsense.

358
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,440
No.

359
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,840
She's really a girl.

360
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,480
I knew it.

361
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
Whether it's a boy or a girl,

362
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,360
no matter how you create the Jianghu,

363
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,680
it's your own business.

364
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
As long as you like it.

365
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Madam and lords.

366
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
How are you?

367
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,960
Have you found a recruit?

368
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Hello?

369
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,080
I've heard that there's

370
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,040
a very young girl

371
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,280
in the

372
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,800
non-ύrpТы border.

373
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,240
The border of the two Zhuhai Province.

374
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,820
She's English.

375
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,040
I was one of the most young people

376
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm thinking

377
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
if this Bian Luo Huan

378
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
is my twin brother.

379
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,880
You, me, and Bian Luo Huan,

380
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,560
what's the relationship between us?

381
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,920
What are you doing?

382
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,120
Why do you think so much?

383
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,840
We've been living together for the past three years.

384
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,400
We've been living together for the past three years.

385
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,520
Isn't it a one-day thing?

386
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,360
What's wrong?

387
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,480
What did I say wrong?

388
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
You're right.

389
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,920
We've arrived at Wuyuan Village.

390
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,560
Isn't this the place we came to last time?

391
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,200
So this Wuyuan Village is right under the Wugou.

392
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,200
Jinzhao,

393
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
I didn't expect we'd come back.

394
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,920
Yes, it's like a dream.

395
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,120
The houses here have changed.

396
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,040
They're much better than before.

397
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,200
The village is much better than before.

398
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,400
The village here is really a river.

399
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Yes.

400
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,520
And everyone here is nice to us.

401
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,320
Miss Yue, you're back.

402
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,640
No.

403
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,640
Shi Wang, what do you want to eat later?

404
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,480
I want to eat...

405
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,440
I want to eat...

406
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,800
Eat...

407
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,720
Egg noodles.

408
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,640
Egg noodles.

409
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,560
Let's go. We'll go back first.

410
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
Where is your house?

411
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,840
The most shabby one.

412
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,720
Let's go.

413
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Three years ago, Jinzhao and I lived here.

414
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,400
It seems that it's not easy for Jinzhao and Yue to live here.

415
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,160
At that time, Jinzhao and I were meant to be.

416
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
This was the only house we had.

417
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
We lived together.

418
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Ma Shuhong, he's still not following the rules.

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,960
What rules?

420
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
What are you talking about?

421
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,840
Why are you touching my lips?

422
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,520
Aren't you going to tell everyone that you stole my boat?

423
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,880
What you said is a bit strange. Do you know that?

424
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,840
It's not strange.

425
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,840
You should be the one who stole my boat.

426
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,480
Okay, let's get down to business.

427
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,400
Let's clean up here.

428
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,040
Let's rest here tonight.

429
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay.

430
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,600
The three villagers just now

431
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,320
were wearing this kind of gold.

432
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,520
Jinzhao used this kind of gold

433
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,440
to exchange for our road fee.

434
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,800
It's very valuable.

435
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,680
This gold can make the bean bag stronger.

436
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,560
The village used to be very poor.

437
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,400
But now,

438
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,440
it's much better than before we left.

439
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,480
It seems that the villagers secretly traded with Qiyuan Sect

440
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,280
and sold the gold to Qiyuan Sect.

441
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,720
That's why the village is in a state of panic.

442
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,720
But these villagers look very kind.

443
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,760
How could they do such a thing?

444
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,000
Maybe they don't know anything about Qiyuan Sect.

445
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,080
Qi is right.

446
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
The Wuyuan Village is located in the remote area.

447
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,800
They just want to improve their life.

448
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,760
If these villagers are in cahoots with Qiyuan Sect,

449
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,400
it will be difficult for us to get some information from them.

450
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,000
Instead of asking the villagers,

451
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,720
it's better to lure the people behind us out.

452
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,280
That's right.

453
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
We can use the crystal stone to lure the snake out of the cave.

454
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,520
How?

455
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,360
Let's start with Mrs. Shi.

456
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,720
She has been the village's stewardess.

457
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,600
If the village really has something to do with Qiyuan Sect,

458
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,040
she will definitely know about it.

459
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,600
Zhai Congming.

460
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,200
Mrs. Shi.

461
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,880
You are here.

462
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Little boy.

463
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Little girl Qi.

464
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,240
Why are you here?

465
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,200
Let me see.

466
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,080
You look prettier and prettier.

467
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,920
Mrs. Shi.

468
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,440
We are here to ask about three years ago.

469
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,760
Three years ago?

470
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,440
Yes.

471
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,800
Three years ago,

472
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,360
did you see a person

473
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
who looked exactly like me?

474
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
Look exactly like you?

475
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,720
I have never seen her.

476
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,760
What?

477
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Then what about Uncle Lin Yun?

478
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,160
He found us in the mine

479
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
and brought us to the village.

480
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,160
I know him.

481
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,560
He has been with you

482
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,800
in this village for a while.

483
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,840
But after you left,

484
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,280
he left immediately.

485
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,360
By the way,

486
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,120
it seems that someone found him near the mine.

487
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
If you can't find him,

488
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,800
you can go to him.

489
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,400
There is one more thing, Mrs. Shi.

490
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,480
We are here.

491
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,740
We want to find out the

492
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
whereabouts of the gold.

493
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,320
We found this gold

494
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,000
at the site of Qiyuan Sect.

495
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,680
I don't know what Qiyuan Sect is.

496
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,440
Mrs. Shi.

497
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,880
Qiyuan Sect is evil.

498
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,600
You can't help them.

499
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,160
Mrs. Shi.

500
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
Just tell us.

501
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,640
I don't know.

502
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,360
Little boy and little girl Qi.

503
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
Don't ask about this.

504
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,800
Just go.

505
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,800
Go.

506
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,280
Mrs. Shi.

507
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,480
Go.

508
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,800
The village is under the influence of Mrs. Shi.

509
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,800
The village should be colluding with Qiyuan Sect.

510
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
And he won't say anything.

511
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,720
Let's split up.

512
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Okay.

513
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,600
Luo, Ming and Shi,

514
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
go check over there.

515
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,280
Qi and I will be here.

516
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,680
Is there really something wrong with Mrs. Shi?

517
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
I don't know.

518
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,800
It doesn't look like her.

519
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,240
Senior Xianqing.

520
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,080
Senior Xianqing.

521
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,080
You are the best

522
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,240
in disguise.

523
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't understand.

524
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,320
Xianqing, can you speak human language?

525
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,840
Xianqing is probably saying...

526
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,880
Saying what?

527
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,840
She said...

528
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,160
Why are you like Zhao Yan?

529
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,680
You got the wrong dog.

530
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,680
Speaking of which,

531
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,880
I'll stay.

532
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,360
Are you still watching over the dog?

533
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,240
What?

534
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
Xianqing is a high-level drug.

535
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,320
How can she use such a low-level trick?

536
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,280
What is a high-level drug?

537
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,440
Don't ask so many questions.

538
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,400
There's a demon.

539
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,600
Let's go and check.

540
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,960
Don't run!

541
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
Uncle Yan.

542
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,320
You scared me.

543
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,760
Qi.

544
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,080
Yue.

545
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Why are you here?

546
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,040
Uncle Lin, why are you here?

547
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,280
I...

548
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,080
I was passing by Wuyan Village.

549
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
I came in and met you.

550
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,600
Did you find a suspicious person passing by?

551
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,440
Suspicious person?

552
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,840
No.

553
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,680
I lost my mind.

554
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,200
Uncle Lin, I want to ask you a question.

555
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,040
Go ahead.

556
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,160
When you found us three years ago,

557
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
were there any other people around us?

558
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,680
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

559
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,000
Uncle Lin, please think about it.

560
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,840
It's very important to Jingzhao.

561
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Is there anyone

562
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,320
who looks exactly like me?

563
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,360
No.

564
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,080
When I found you three years ago,

565
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,080
you were lying there.

566
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,120
I thought you were dead.

567
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,160
I was shocked.

568
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
But later I found that you were fine.

569
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,560
So I brought you to the village.

570
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
Qi, how have you been these three years?

571
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,920
We've been traveling abroad these three years.

572
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,320
We've been to many places,

573
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,640
eaten many delicious foods,

574
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,240
and made many good friends.

575
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,760
You've made friends?

576
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,360
That's great.

577
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,360
Yue, don't be so anxious.

578
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,280
You just want to chase after

579
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,520
the sun and the moon every day.

580
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,880
Look at the people around you.

581
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,080
Look at the scenery around you.

582
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,320
Cherish the moment, right?

583
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
I'll live in the village for the next few days.

584
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,080
Come to me if you need anything.

585
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,120
Goodbye, Uncle Lin.

586
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,720
Okay, I'm leaving.

587
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,560
Go.

588
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,400
Go.

589
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,200
I don't know

590
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,400
why Yue and Qi came back.

591
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,920
Since the Dragon King three years ago,

592
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,800
I...

593
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,840
I just remember what you said.

594
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,840
I can't let others know

595
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,360
what we did wrong.

596
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,240
Now they've found out.

597
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,560
Yue, Qi's Straight from Wu Mountain...

598
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,240
has been caught.

599
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
They were caught

600
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,600
by thealling.

601
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,560
Yue was합니다.

602
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,000
How can they attack someone

603
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:03,620
after killing

604
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,620
I'll follow my words.

605
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Why isn't Xian Qing back yet?

606
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Is Xiao Zhao Yan worrying about me?

607
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
There's a demon.

608
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
Because we went after the demon?

609
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
No.

610
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,620
You must have had contact with the demon

611
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
to produce such a strong demon aura.

612
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
And this demon aura

613
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
is very similar to the one

614
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
we encountered in the sunset village.

615
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
Miss... Miss Shuo Xuan?

616
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
Miss Yue, Mr. Yue.

617
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,620
You said you went after the demon beast.

618
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,620
But you ran into that Lin Yuan Shu.

619
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,620
Could Lin Yuan Shu be a demon too?

620
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,620
I always see Lin Yuan Shu as a savior.

621
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Today, I saw the scales on his body

622
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
that are as sharp as Shuo Xuan's.

623
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Could they really be a demon?

624
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Didn't they save us twice?

625
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
One time when we woke up in the mist village.

626
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,620
And one time when we were in the Yi Ma River.

627
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,620
Why didn't they tell us?

628
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
I always suspected that Shuo Xuan knew you.

629
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
If Lin Yuan Shu and Shuo Xuan are really a couple.

630
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Then he should know our background.

631
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,620
But he just watched us in vain.

632
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Why?

633
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
Why did he do that to me?

634
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Don't be so nervous.

635
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
How about I go and get Lin Yuan Shu

636
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
and torture him?

637
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
To force him to tell us our background.

638
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Torture him?

639
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Are you scared?

640
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,620
You are a man of your word.

641
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
Are you scared to raise your hand?

642
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
I don't think so.

643
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,620
That Lin Yuan seems to be watching us in secret.

644
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,620
How about we see what he is doing?

645
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,620
And that woman behind the stone.

646
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
They call this stone gold.

647
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,620
And they also discussed that they would take us to the mine tomorrow.

648
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Someone is waiting for us there.

649
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Okay.

650
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
It seems that the snake is about to come out.

651
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
It's moving.

652
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
Girl.

653
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Boy.

654
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,620
Grandma Shen.

655
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,620
Boy.

656
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,620
Grandma Shen.

657
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
Girl.

658
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
Please sit down.

659
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,620
No.

660
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,620
The stone is marked on this map.

661
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
The buyer will go to the mine tomorrow.

662
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
You...

663
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
You go tomorrow.

664
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,620
Okay.

665
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
Qi Yuan Zong came to ask for the army to enter the tomb.

666
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,620
Then we will have a close fight.

667
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
Come.

668
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Come.

669
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,620
The shooting star that breaks through the sky

670
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,620
Burned the past

671
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,620
Forgot the new name

672
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,620
The magic behind the mask

673
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Knows my eyes

674
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Who can see

675
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:32,620
It's destined that I will fight for you

676
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Even if the ending is hard to escape

677
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:48,620
Can't help but exchange a little prettier

678
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Leave the unqu partiated reason to love

679
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Happy house performance

680
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,820
I can't help but say

681
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:25,220
It's destined that I'll do my best for you

682
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:33,100
Even if I try, I may fail

683
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:41,540
I don't care about the past, but I love you for the rest of my life

684
00:40:41,620 --> 00:41:04,140
ームze
