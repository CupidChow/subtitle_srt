5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The spirit vein has been unstable for years.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Maybe there will be changes.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It will involve you.

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yue Xiaoge, Miss Yue.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No matter what happens in the future,

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I hope you will be careful and never give up.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Never give up?

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you want to say?

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You just said,

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you have no eyes to see the future.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you know something?

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Will we encounter disaster in the future?

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And, and,

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you just said,

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
among us,

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
there will be two people die soon.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are lying to us, right?

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Han Sui's story is like this.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then, who will it be?

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's the person who should die.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
God, God.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In my opinion,

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it's only a few decades.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The number of eyes to see has existed for tens of millions of years.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What he said is not true.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't know how many years later.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, go back first.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
God, God.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Master,

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
are you unhappy?

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm worried about what Wang Chen told me.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a private official.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
His fate is in his control.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't think too much.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He said that two people,

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
it's probably me and Jin Zhao.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Shi Fang,

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
if fate really exists,

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
if one's life is destined,

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it can't be changed,

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that's ridiculous.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How boring.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'd rather believe that

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
in this world,

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
there is no such thing as fate.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can't be changed?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is not the fate I understand.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mr. Gu.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Look.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What about this tree's fate?

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It should be dying soon.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If I move it to a place with a beautiful landscape,

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll always be a night-sleeper for it.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Maybe it's its fate to be saved by you.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because of your words,

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I changed my mind.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As I see it,

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
there are countless possibilities in the future.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
However, there is a possibility that

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
it seems to be the most likely to be true.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
People call it fate.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But if someone has enough faith and strength

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to go to another path,

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it's not impossible.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Simply put,

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
if this tree is killed by itself,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it will die.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But if it's saved by someone,

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
it will try to survive,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and there may be no way to survive.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As long as there is a little change,

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
the prophecy of the five-gou will change.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Is that right, Mr. Gu?

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Miss Yue has extraordinary spirit.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And uncle.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And uncle.

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Master, let's go back.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They are all gone.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You are still here.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you miss something?

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Mr. Gu.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't force yourself.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When the time comes,

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
everything will be revealed.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are right.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yue.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are not brothers with Miss Yue, right?

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I heard from Xianqing that

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you are practicing another kind of...

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
God's entry into the world is omnipotent.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There is a connection between the spirit and the spirit.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
God's entry into the world.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Interesting.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Where did you learn this magic?

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When Qi and I woke up from the night of the Wuyuan Village,

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
we already knew it.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's really amazing.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Since this magic is accompanied by you two,

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
it seems that its secret lies in a love letter.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The longer you two are together,

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the deeper the relationship is.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This magic can play a more powerful role.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The deeper the relationship is,

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the stronger the power is.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
By the way, Mr. Gu.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know if I should ask you something.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Just say it.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Why did you tell Qi

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to think more about what he should do

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and not listen to others all the time?

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Isn't it a matter of course?

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He is simple and kind.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He is easy to be fooled.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We have been trying to make friends for three years.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
How can I be someone else?

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Besides,

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
didn't you say that the deeper the relationship is,

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the stronger the power is

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
when you have the connection?

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yue Xiaoge.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not a conflict

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
to let Miss Yue be independent

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and have more feelings with you.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
According to what I saw these days,

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
although Miss Yue is naive,

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
she is not stupid.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
One day she will understand

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that in her world,

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it's not just you two.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not good to protect her too much.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
She can't leave me.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is it because Miss Yue can't leave you

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
or you can't leave Miss Yue?

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have seen it, too.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Qi and I are destined to be together.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It doesn't matter if she can't leave me

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
or I can't leave her.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What does it matter?

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Goodbye.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Qin Zhao.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you still thinking about what Chen Simin said?

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Didn't Uncle Gu say that

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
fate can be changed?

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Qin.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We came to this world together.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Have you ever thought about

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
what our relationship is?

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No matter what our relationship is,

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
we will always be together.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you know what the difference is?

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But this world is much bigger

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
than we think.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you sure

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
we can be together forever?

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will take you wherever I go

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
because I want to protect you.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Forget it.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I've decided to be your backer for life.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It doesn't matter what relationship it is.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come with me.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's go.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Qin.

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Mr. Gu said that

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
the deeper our relationship is,

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the more we can

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
exert our strength.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Should we try to

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
deepen our relationship?

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How?

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The immortal said that

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the top of the moon is the best time

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to deepen our relationship.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Can we deepen our relationship by looking at the moon?

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course not.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We have to say the words.

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Say what?

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Try it.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Listen.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The top of the moon is the best time

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
to deepen our relationship by looking at the moon.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How is it?

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How is it?

196
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What does it mean?

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Qin, look.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is a lamp.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mr. Gu said that

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
when the year of the rat is over,

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
these lamps will be moved from the clouds.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
When the lamp is lit,

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the disappearing magic

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
may be re-enacted temporarily.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Disappearing magic?

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Then let's catch one.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We can carry it with us.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
These lamps are spirit.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If we can't catch them,

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
we can't use them.

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We can't use them.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We can't use them.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We can't use them.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We can't use them.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
These lamps are spirit.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can't catch them.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't you always want to try

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
flying with a sword?

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's go and try it.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Can your sword be used?

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Try it.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The light of the past

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is looking for a piece of the past.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The past is lost, the heart is about to leave.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's destined.

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The heart is beating fast.

228
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The years are endless.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The color of the January is wrong.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Maybe it's all about you.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All the reincarnations are like the years are wrong.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everything is unforgettable.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The past is a scene.

234
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How many tears of smiles

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
will make happiness fall?

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've been looking for this year.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The past is lost, the heart is about to leave.

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The color of the January is wrong.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't doubt.

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The past is a scene.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Qin Zhao,

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
do we have a good relationship?

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Maybe,

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
maybe.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's try again.

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
How?

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Close your eyes first.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yue...

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yue Qin.

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is the truth you said.

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Then you wake up and come.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come on.

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Qin Zhao, look.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What to look at?

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Qin Zhao, you...

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Your lips are so soft.

257
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Qin,

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
do you really know...

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Forget it.

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's late.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Go back.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Your face is red.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're wrong.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Really.

265
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Your face is red.

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're wrong.

267
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're wrong.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're wrong.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Really.

270
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Your face is red.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're wrong.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let me see.

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It seems that Xianqing and Xiu'er...

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and Yue Xiaoge will be separated in the future.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I saw the lights in the study.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I knew you were busy.

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Xiu'er has something to tell me.

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I saw in the fantasy today...

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that you had cut down the tree in the yard.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The first year I came to the mountain,

281
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you planted that tree for me.

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I saw that tree.

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But three years ago,

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I followed you to the whole gate for the first time.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
After I came back,

286
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
you cut down the tree.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You planted the pear tree.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You treated me...

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
as if I was a gold.

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Until today,

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you never told me the reason.

292
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And...

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Master, you always want to inherit the Wugou tree.

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But who wants to inherit their own sad place?

295
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Master said it before.

296
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Cut down that tree...

297
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
because you're afraid that you have friends...

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and want you to focus on cultivation.

299
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You've grown up.

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can go out and make friends...

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and learn to cook.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Master.

303
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll never take care of you again.

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's late.

305
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I should go to bed early.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then don't let me take care of you forever.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let go of your old love.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You can't have her.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Xiu'er is always stubborn.

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Since childhood,

311
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
when did you win Xiu'er?

312
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can cut down the tree in this yard.

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can take care of the tree.

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll take care of it.

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'll take care of it.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll take care of it.

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't cut down the tree in the yard.

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But in my heart,

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't cut down the tree.

320
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why is it so hot?

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Not right either.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why can't I find the feeling I had just now?

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So this is the feeling.

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is this...

326
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Is this a dream?

327
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Shi Fang.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Jingzhao.

329
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Shi Fang.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We've known each other for so long.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I haven't heard you mention the Zhenwu Alliance.

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

333
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
My wound has healed.

334
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
According to the previous information,

335
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm fine now.

336
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm fine now.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm fine now.

338
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm fine now.

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
According to the previous agreement,

340
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
we're going to find Brother Luo.

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We have to go to your Zhenwu Alliance.

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Say it.

343
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I have a bottom line.

344
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
For example, your leader.

345
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What does he look like?

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is he strict?

347
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Okay.

348
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Our leader wears black clothes all year round.

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's very loyally.

350
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He gives people a sense of pride and dignity.

351
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He's very respectful of him.

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It seems that the person I saw last night

353
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
should be the leader.

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Xingzhao, when are you going to leave?

355
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's better to leave today.

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'll go tell Senior Gu.

357
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We'll leave tomorrow.

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
There's no reason to stay here and not go back.

359
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm leaving now.

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Xiuer,

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
how long are you going to stay?

363
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Master, let me stay with you for a few more days.

364
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You're in your youth. You should go down the mountain and see the world.

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's not good to go down the mountain.

366
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You taught me magic from the Taoist School.

367
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Taoists are always very quiet and quiet.

368
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We're living here.

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's not the government and the Taoism of the Immortal School. Why should we go down the mountain?

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We've never entered the world. How can we talk about the world?

371
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No. You've been through a lot of things.

372
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You can understand the way you really want to go.

373
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But I always go down the mountain to kill demons.

374
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I also joined the government and the government.

375
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I thought you were a lovely little girl back then.

376
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Now you're so lonely and tired.

377
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's all my fault.

378
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I knew I wouldn't raise children.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I only taught you some non-human concepts.

380
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But I never wanted to let you be raised by a normal person.

381
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I really shouldn't have done that.

382
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's my fault.

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's not your fault.

384
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's all my fault.

385
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Master, you don't have to say it again. I'll go.

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Your eyes are really a little crazy.

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Xingqing, it's not a gentleman to talk behind someone's back.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So I didn't cover it up, did I?

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why don't you go down the mountain with Xiu'er and think it's a small town?

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I knew it.

391
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You also want to go to Jing'an, don't you?

392
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm not going to Jing'an.

393
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm going to Jing'an.

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You also want to go to Jing'an, don't you?

395
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
In that case, it's still early. You can go together.

396
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Master, I don't want that answer.

397
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Let Xiu'er stay and stay with you, okay?

398
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Xiu'er, be careful when you go out.

399
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Try to care more about others.

400
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's enough to have a master.

401
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Since Xiaoqiu wants to stay with you, why did you push her out?

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
She's 18 years old. She should have a better place to go.

403
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Human stubbornness is always like this.

404
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Xingqing, please take care of Xiu'er for me.

405
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
No need to say. I'll go.

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Take care.

407
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Let me tell you.

408
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
When the world first opened...

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll buy you a small bag. Please enjoy.

410
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Master, the buns are here.

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Here, eat the buns.

412
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
How is the future?

413
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Please listen to the next part.

414
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Master, are you still thinking about the prophecy?

415
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Uncle Gu said it might change. Don't worry too much.

416
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking...

417
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:48,340
You can't explain if it's about the

418
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Jinzhao, I'll toast you.

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Luo Ruicun, Xiaoqiu and I are here. Why don't you toast us?

420
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll toast you. I'll toast you all.

421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll drink it with soup.

422
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm fine.

423
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I heard someone is causing trouble in front of us.

424
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It seems to be a member of Qi Yuan Song.

425
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Let's go and have a look.

426
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'll go back to the alliance first.

427
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Master, let's go together.

428
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Let's go.

429
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Master, please wrap these up. We'll come later.

430
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Back! Back! Did you see that?

431
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Everyone back! Back!

432
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Everyone back!

433
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
If you take one more step forward, I'll kill my daughter!

434
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Isn't this...

435
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Everyone back!

436
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Do you know this is her daughter, Li Fei'er?

437
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Do you know her? She's my neighbor.

438
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Last year, she recorded Qi Yuan Song and donated all her assets.

439
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Old Fan was so angry.

440
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You called me a dog to be blind.

441
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I should have died long ago.

442
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Where's the dog?

443
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Bring the dog out!

444
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The dog!

445
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I can't see it.

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Get down!

447
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What are you looking at?

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
What are you looking at?

449
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Stop hurting the people!

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Bring the dog out!

451
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Dog!

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Master, where's the good part?

453
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
If you don't bring the dog out, I'll kill her!

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll kill my daughter!

455
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
How's Master Lv's performance?

456
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Not bad.

457
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Not bad.

458
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Get out!

459
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Chief Zuo is here!

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Why are those crazy people here?

461
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What?

462
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't move.

463
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Don't move.

464
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I have to confirm.

465
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The kid scared me.

466
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm Zuo Guanren.

467
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Zuo Guanren?

468
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You old thief!

469
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You finally came out!

470
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Everyone, look!

471
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's Zuo Guanren!

472
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
He hurt my master and ruined my brother!

473
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He stopped my family from getting a great fortune!

474
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You're so bad!

475
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Don't talk nonsense!

476
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Qi Yuan Song has committed many crimes.

477
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He has bewitched the people and ruined their families.

478
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
He's a man of justice.

479
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
If you don't do your job,

480
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
people will be disappointed.

481
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yes!

482
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're right!

483
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes!

484
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Zuo Guanren!

485
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Zuo Guanren!

486
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You're talking nonsense!

487
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm telling you today,

488
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you can't ruin my family again!

489
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Do you hear me?

490
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The Zhenwu Alliance never values evil.

491
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
If you still have a little bit of humanity,

492
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
let your daughter go.

493
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll save her for now.

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
No.

495
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That will only make Qi Yuan Song

496
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
arrest more people to threaten Zhenwu Alliance.

497
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We must save her.

498
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes!

499
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So many people are involved in this.

500
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
How can they be our father?

501
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes!

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Who doesn't know?

503
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
How can we face them when they grow up?

504
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Wen Yang, come here.

505
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes.

506
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't move!

507
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't come over!

508
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Do you hear me?

509
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
In order to eliminate them,

510
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't care about their lives anymore.

511
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You forced me to do this.

512
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Today, I'll fight with my daughter

513
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
with my blood.

514
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Wait!

515
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Wait!

516
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Maybe there's a way to do this.

517
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Xiao Qing has a good idea.

518
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Wait!

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Stop!

520
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Brother,

521
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
he's our man.

522
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
To be honest,

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I've been looking down on Zhenwu Alliance for a long time.

524
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The reason why they're trying to get rid of the Holy Family

525
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
is to make a living.

526
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You even dare to offend the Holy Master.

527
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You're not to be forgiven.

528
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're going to die.

529
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yes.

530
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Brother, congratulations.

531
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You succeeded.

532
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But...

533
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But what?

534
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But,

535
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
there are people dying every moment in this world.

536
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
How did the Holy Master know

537
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
that you died for the sake of the Holy Family?

538
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The disciples who are loyal to the Holy Master

539
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
will all get the Holy Master's token.

540
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It's the Holy Master.

541
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The Holy Master is summoning me.

542
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can't let the Holy Master be angry.

543
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I got the token.

544
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What should I do?

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I got the token.

546
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What?

547
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I got the token.

548
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I got the token!

549
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm going to fly.

550
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm going to fly.

551
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm going to fly to serve the Lord.

552
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm going to fly.

553
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm going to fly.

554
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm going to fly.

555
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm going to fly.

556
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm going to fly.

557
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The Martial Arts King is really a famous martial artist.

558
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

559
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Look.

560
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The one who released the secret weapon

561
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
is the Hall Leader of the Eternal Hall, Wenya.

562
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And that sister.

563
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
She is Qiu Lingyun,

564
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
the Hall Leader of the Tyun Hall.

565
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Her qing kung is very good.

566
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
She's really a good fighter.

567
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then you're also very good at being the Hall Leader.

568
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Lord Si Zhao.

569
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Lord Si Zhao.

570
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I'm sorry, Lord.

572
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm sorry, Lord.

573
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I was just surprised.

576
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You scared me.

577
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I was wrong to believe you.

578
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You should hurry up.

579
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't.

580
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
How can you say that?

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You are the next high disciple of our sect

582
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
who is about to fly.

583
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
How can you say that?

584
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I just...

585
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Didn't you say that

586
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
this Lv is very talented?

587
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Didn't you say that

588
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
he can destroy the reputation of the righteous and the evil?

589
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
He ate six gold coins.

590
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
To be honest,

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
these crazy people are really out of their minds.

592
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Who said that?

593
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Lord, it's good that you

594
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
can successfully lead the brothers

595
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
to stand on the wheel every time.

596
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
These people

597
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
are really

598
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
very good at biting dogs.

599
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
They can't even be thrown away.

600
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you understand what I mean?

601
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Lord, you mean...

602
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We are dogs.

603
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Damn it!

604
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Damn it!

605
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You are a dog!

606
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Lord, I mean

607
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
we can't do anything about these guys.

608
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Let the righteous people deal with them.

609
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Just say it.

610
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Go on.

611
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm done with this time.

612
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Okay.

613
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'll move you a little bit more.

614
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'll beat you to a dog.

615
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That's great!

616
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Great!

617
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Are you okay?

618
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Are you okay?

619
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You deserve to be a father.

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Chief.

621
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
A little Qiyuan Sect

622
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
can actually beat a dog.

623
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You have bewitched people's hearts.

624
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You dare to kill your own people

625
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and destroy the people's food.

626
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You are a vicious person.

627
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I've made a vow

628
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
to lead the people to eliminate Qiyuan Sect

629
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
and keep the people safe.

630
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Great!

631
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Kill Qiyuan Sect!

632
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Kill Qiyuan Sect!

633
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Kill Qiyuan Sect!

634
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Kill Qiyuan Sect!

635
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We still need to deal with the subsequent things.

636
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Please go to eat first.

637
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Li Yun.

638
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Take good care of this little girl.

639
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yes.

640
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Wenyang.

641
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes.

642
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Lock her up.

643
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Go to her house and check the situation.

644
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

645
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Take her away.

646
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Get up.

647
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Thank you for your help.

648
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Follow me to the hall.

649
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Let's go in.

650
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Don't be afraid.

651
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Don't be afraid.

652
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Grandma, don't be afraid.

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Miss Mingxiu is so gentle.

654
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
She seems to be different from usual.

655
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Xiao Xiu should have thought about

656
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
her childhood.

657
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Childhood?

658
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What's wrong with childhood?

659
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Don't talk about the past.

660
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Fei'er, be good.

661
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Later,

662
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
go with that sister.

663
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Go.

664
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Little girl, don't cry.

665
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Uncle has killed the demon.

666
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But my mother...

667
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
My mother...

668
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Mother.

669
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Mother.

670
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Mother.

671
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Mother.

672
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Mother.

673
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Mother.

674
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The deep love behind the scenes

675
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Only through my eyes

676
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Who can see

677
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's destined that I'll fight for you

678
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell

679
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll exchange a little bit of my life for love

680
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll leave the unspoken promise to love

681
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It looks like a random path

682
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The traces of burning

683
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Hiding the secrets

684
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The plot of the word

685
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's all my little game

686
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The fate arranged

687
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's destined that I'll fight for you

688
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell

689
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll exchange a little bit of my life for love

690
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll leave the unspoken promise to love

691
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's destined that I'll fight for you

692
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell

693
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'll exchange a little bit of my life for love

694
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll leave the unspoken promise to love
