2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,636
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,624
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,540
   

19
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,660
   

20
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,459
The spiritual vein has been unstable in recent years.

21
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,260
There might be some unforeseen events that will involve you.

22
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,699
Young Brother Yue and Miss Yue. No matter what happens in the future,

23
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,859
I hope you remain cautious and fearless, and never give up.

24
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,079
Never give up?

25
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,979
Senior, what do you mean?

26
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:27,139
You just mentioned the mouth of the Pureness spring could tell the future.

27
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,279
Do you know something?

28
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,799
Will we encounter calamity in the future?

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,419
B-Besides, you just said that two of us would die soon.

30
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,520
You're just lying, right?

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,980
 This is what the Cold Marrow indicates. 

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,699
Th-Then who are they?

33
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,100
 The ones fated to die, of course. 

34
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,560
Goddess! Goddess!

35
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:05,679
In my view, decades are but a moment.

36
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:09,120
The spring garrison has existed for millions of years.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,420
She could be talking about years away.

38
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,700
That's true. That's true...

39
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,400
All right, let's head back.

40
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,612
Let's go.

41
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,319
Shifang, you seem unhappy.

42
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,139
I'm truly worried about the words of Wangchen Siming.

43
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,540
She's a Siming, she holds the destiny of humans in her grip.

44
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,940
Don't overthink it.

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,539
The two people she mentioned could be me and Jinzhao.

46
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,739
What nonsense?

47
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,199
Shifang, if one's life is truly predestined and cannot be changed,

48
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,680
Shifang, if one's life is truly predestined and cannot be changed,

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,860
how absurd and boring would that be?

50
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,500
I'd rather believe that there's simply no such thing as fate in this world.

51
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,600
Unchangeable.

52
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,620
That is not the fate I understand.

53
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,919
Senior Gu.

54
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,320
Look. What do you think the fate of this tree is?

55
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,019
It should be dying soon. Right?

56
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,399
What if I move it to a place with plentiful water and fertile land

57
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,780
and regularly prune it?

58
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,919
Then perhaps being saved by you is its fate.

59
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,639
What if I change my mind after hearing your words?

60
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,340
In my view, the future holds countless possibilities,

61
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,120
and among them, there is one that seems to be most likely to come true.

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,379
People call this "fate."

63
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,720
- But if someone has enough conviction and strength to defy the path of heaven, 
 - Fate?

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,260
it's not impossible to take another path.

65
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:11,539
Simply put, it's like this tree.

66
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,960
If left to its own, it would surely die.

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,360
But if someone saves it and it fights for its own survival,

68
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,816
there may be a way out.

69
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,860
Even the slightest change can alter Pureness' prophecy.

70
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,440
Is that right, Uncle Gu?

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,880
Miss Yue is very clever.

72
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,299
It's good there's still hope.

73
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,960
Shifang, let's go back then.

74
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay.

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,379
Everyone has left, and you're still here.

76
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,420
Is there something you can't figure out?

77
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,292
Senior Gu.

78
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,579
Don't force things.

79
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:08,379
When the time comes, answers will naturally appear.

80
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,279
Yes, you're right.

81
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,479
You and Miss Yue aren't biological siblings, are you?

82
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,659
No.

83
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:22,019
Xian Qing told me you and Miss Yue were practicing a spell called...

84
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,920
Omnipotent Mindlink.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,659
Omnipotent. How interesting.

86
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,639
May I ask where you learned this skill?

87
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,140
Qi and I knew it as soon as we woke up in Wuyan Village.

88
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,479
It really is magical.

89
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,240
Since the spell exists with you two,

90
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
it seems the secret may lie in the feelings.

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,400
The longer the two of you are together and the deeper the feelings,

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,859
the more powerful the spell becomes.

93
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,039
The deeper the feelings, the stronger the power.

94
00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:05,659
By the way Senior Gu, may I ask something?

95
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,980
Please go ahead.

96
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,460
Why did you tell Qi to think for herself

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,099
and stop always listening to others?

98
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,599
Isn't this the way it should be?

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,879
Qi is naive, kind, and easily deceived.

100
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,819
We have depended on each other for these three years.

101
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm not some random person.

102
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,379
Besides, didn't you say the deeper our bond,

103
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:33,380
the stronger Mindlink would be?

104
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,980
Young Brother Yue,  Miss Yue's being independent doesn't conflict with your bond deepening.

105
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,680
From what I've seen these past few days,

106
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,599
Miss Yue is innocent, but she's not foolish.

107
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,919
One day she'll understand that her world doesn't only consist of the two of you.

108
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,619
Over protection, in the end, is improper.

109
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:55,240
No, she can't live without me.

110
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,560
Is it really that Miss Yue can't live without you

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,299
or you can't live without Miss Yue?

112
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:11,600
As you've seen, Qi and I are destined to be together forever.

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,719
Does the question matter?

114
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:19,599
Senior, I'll take my leave.

115
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:36,836
Jinzhao.

116
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,740
Still thinking about what Wangchen Siming said?

117
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,639
Didn't Uncle Gu already say fate could be changed?

118
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:59,180
Qi, we came into this world together.

119
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,660
Have you ever thought about what our relationship is exactly?

120
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,240
Regardless of what our relationship is, we'll always be together anyway.

121
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,919
What difference does it make to know or not?

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,120
But this world is much bigger than we imagine.

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,319
Are you sure we can really be together forever?

124
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:27,980
Certainly. I'll take you with me wherever I go,

125
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,599
because I'm going to protect you.

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,099
 Forget it. I've already decided to be your lifelong support. 

127
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,599
 What our relationship is doesn't matter. 

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,600
Come with me. Let's go.

129
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,659
Qi, Senior Gu said the deeper our bond is,

130
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:15,199
the more powerful Mindlink would be.

131
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,379
Shall we try to deepen our bond further?

132
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,219
How do we try?

133
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:30,000
The ancients said when the moon rises above the willow branches, it's the best time to deepen relationships.

134
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,399
Just by watching the moon?

135
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,739
Of course not. You have to recite poems, too.

136
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,612
What poems?

137
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,796
Let me give it a try.

138
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:55,120
Listen. Night after night, I yearn for you. Even the moon seems dimmed.

139
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:58,044
What do you think?

140
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,380
- How is it? 
 - What does it mean?

141
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,344
Jinzhao, look.

142
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,499
They are called Tideng.

143
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:26,360
Senior Gu said, every year in spring, they migrate from the clouds and mist.

144
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,800
They may temporarily bring back lost spells.

145
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,340
Lost spells?

146
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:40,179
Can we catch one and carry it with us?

147
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,240
They're spirits. You can't catch them.

148
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:53,530
What are you doing?

149
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,599
Haven't you always wanted to try sword flying? Let's give it a try.

150
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,140
Is your Sword of Thoughts okay?

151
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,580
Just give it a try!

152
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,660
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

153
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,644
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

154
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:23,744
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

155
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,548
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

156
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,620
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

157
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,488
♫  The years leave no trace behind  ♫

158
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,724
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

159
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,748
♫  I fill the page with my memories   ♫

160
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:42,368
♫  All about you  ♫

161
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:46,472
♫  All my laughter and joy is because of you  ♫

162
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:50,512
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

163
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:52,360
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

164
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,496
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

165
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:59,816
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

166
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:03,976
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

167
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:08,464
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

168
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:10,344
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

169
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,296
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

170
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:19,208
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

171
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,039
Jinzhao, have we bonded by doing this?

172
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,340
Perhaps, maybe, I suppose.

173
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,848
Then let's try again.

174
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,520
How do we try?

175
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,699
You close your eyes first.

176
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,056
Yue Qi.

177
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,039
This is how you try?

178
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,640
Then you do it if you can.

179
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,336
Come on.

180
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,572
Jinzhao, look!

181
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,052
Look at what?

182
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,440
Jinzhao, y-y-your lips are so soft.

183
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,140
Qi, do you have any idea...?

184
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,919
Forget it, it's late. Let's go back.

185
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,249
- You're blushing. 
 - You're wrong.

186
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:04,179
It's true. You're blushing. I saw it.

187
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,988
Let me look.

188
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,900
It seems that Xian Qing and Xiu

189
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,200
will have profound entanglements with Young Brother Yue and Miss Yue in the future.

190
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,540
Seeing the light on in the study, I knew you were still working.

191
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,980
Do you have something to tell me?

192
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:48,080
Today in the illusion, I saw you cut down the Bodhi tree in the yard.

193
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,859
The first year I came to Mount Yuqing,

194
00:15:54,859 --> 00:15:57,939
you planted that Bodhi tree for me.

195
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,560
But three years ago, I followed you to the spring vein for the first time,

196
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,499
and after we came back, you cut down the Bodhi tree

197
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,159
and planted a pear tree instead.

198
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,079
You... also weren't as close to me as before.

199
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,540
To this day, you still haven't told me the reason.

200
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,939
And you keep trying to urge me to take over as Pureness' guardian.

201
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:29,939
But who would want to inherit a place that brought them heartache?

202
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,419
I told you I cut down the tree to prevent you from being distracted

203
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:40,379
so that you could focus on your cultivation.

204
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,382
You've grown up and should start your own adventure and make friends.

205
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,880
Complete your training sooner.

206
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,360
I can't take care of you forever.

207
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,000
It's late. Go back and rest early.

208
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,699
Then let me take care of you forever.

209
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:09,296
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

210
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:14,700
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

211
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,576
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

212
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:25,188
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

213
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,360
Let go of those thoughts.

214
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,604
It's impossible.

215
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm a stubborn person

216
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:45,360
and you've never beaten me at being stubborn.

217
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,241
You can cut down the Bodhi tree in this courtyard,

218
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,679
but you can never cut down...

219
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,939
what you can never touch.

220
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:27,759
Why am I so hot?

221
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,792
This isn't right.

222
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,496
Nor is this.

223
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,220
Why can't I find that feeling from just now anymore?

224
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,959
 So this is what it feels like. 

225
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,652
   

226
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:13,140
Could it be the Righteous Martial Alliance?

227
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,560
- Shifang. 
 - Jinzhao.

228
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:41,199
Shifang, I've known you for awhile, but never heard you mention the Righteous Martial Alliance.

229
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,020
Why are you suddenly asking this?

230
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,599
Isn't my injury healed?

231
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,880
According to our previous agreement, it's time to go find Brother Luo.

232
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,540
Doesn't it mean we have to go to your alliance?

233
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,180
Tell me a bit so I have an idea.

234
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,220
For example, what does your leader look like? Is he strict with people?

235
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,440
All right.

236
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,680
Our leader wears black clothes all year round and has a beard.

237
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,719
He gives off a feeling of both boldness and authority.

238
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,839
Everyone respects him greatly.

239
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,160
 So the person I saw last night must've been Zuo Guanren. 

240
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,040
Jinzhao, when do you plan to leave?

241
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,120
No time like the present.

242
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,708
I'll inform Senior Gu and we will set off tomorrow.

243
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,599
 Now, there's no reason to keep dragging my feet and not go back. 

244
00:22:02,439 --> 00:22:06,800
Xiu'er, how much longer are you going to dawdle?

245
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,501
Young Brother Yue and the others are waiting for you to set off together.

246
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,920
Master, let me stay with you for a few more days.

247
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,899
It's good to go down the mountain and experience life when you're young.

248
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,799
There's not much good in it.

249
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,780
Master, the spells you taught me come from the Taoist school.

250
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,920
Taoists value serenity and natural action.

251
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Isn't our seclusion here in line with their principles?

252
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,280
Why should I go down the mountain?

253
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,420
How can one speak of transcendence without experiencing life?

254
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,680
Only after trials can you understand the path you truly want to take.

255
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,719
But don't I often go down the mountain to eliminate demons?

256
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,976
And I've joined the Righteous Martial Alliance.

257
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,439
To think you were an obedient and cute little girl back then.

258
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:04,199
Now you've become so solitary and awkward. It's all my fault.

259
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,499
I knew full well that I didn't know how to raise a child

260
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:10,280
and that Xian Qing could only teach you things about demons.

261
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,780
But I never had the heart to have you adopted by a normal family.

262
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,959
I really shouldn't have.

263
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,896
So it's on me?

264
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:24,880
No, it's all my fault.

265
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,760
Master, no need to say more. I'll go.

266
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,220
Your master's acting is bad.

267
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:45,839
Xian Qing, a gentleman doesn't speak ill of others behind their backs.

268
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,460
That's why I didn't try to hide it. Right?

269
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,401
Why don't you accompany Xiu'er on her trip as a light punishment?

270
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,160
I knew it.

271
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,260
It just so happens that you want to go to Jing'an. Right?

272
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:05,380
If that's the case, you two should set off before it's late.

273
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,439
Master, I don't want that answer anymore.

274
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,980
Could you let me stay and accompany you?

275
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,379
Xiu'er, take good care of yourself when you're away from home.

276
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,939
And try to care more about others.

277
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,260
I only need you.

278
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,199
Xiao Xiu wants to stay by your side.

279
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:45,140
Why are you pushing her away?

280
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,260
She's already 18. She should have a better future.

281
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,520
The stubbornness of humans is always like this.

282
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,099
Xian Qing, please take good care of Xiu'er for me.

283
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,840
No need to say more. I'll go.

284
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,796
Take care.

285
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:37,631
   

286
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,399
Last time, I mentioned the beginning of the world.

287
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,499
Five steamers of soup dumplings. Enjoy.

288
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,540
Shifang, the dumplings are here.

289
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,540
Come on, let's eat dumplings.

290
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:10,240
 To know what happens next, come here next time. 

291
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,160
Shifang, are you still thinking about that prophecy?

292
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Uncle Gu said it might change. Don't worry too much.

293
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,079
I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking...

294
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,240
Is it the Bian Luohuan problem that you're worried about?

295
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,479
I was going to capture Qiyuan Sect's Shengxuan to prove myself,

296
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:37,599
but didn't imagine he'd get away.

297
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,220
Didn't we destroy Fujin Hall?

298
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,920
Yes.

299
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,644
Consider it yours.

300
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,640
R-Really?

301
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,940
And also, everything at Luori Village is yours, too.

302
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,099
Jinzhao, I'll toast you.

303
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,739
Xiao Xiu and I were at Luori Village, too. How come you don't toast to us?

304
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:02,099
Yes, yes, a toast to everyone.

305
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,499
Let me toast with soup.

306
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,639
- Don't mention it. 
  - I hear there's trouble out front at the Righteous Martial Alliance. 

307
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,940
 It seems to be the Qiyuan Sect. 

308
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,280
 - Let's go take a look. 
 - Let's go. 

309
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
I'll go back to the alliance to check first.

310
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,624
Shifang, let's go together!

311
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,112
Let's go.

312
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,839
Please wrap these up. We'll come back to pick them up later.

313
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:38,756
Step back. Did you hear me?! 
    

314
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,959
All of you move back! Move!

315
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,000
You all! Move back!

316
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,020
If anyone takes one more step forward, I'll kill my daughter!

317
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:52,679
Isn't this Lv Dazhi and his daughter Lv Fei'er?

318
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:53,736
You know them?

319
00:27:53,736 --> 00:27:56,400
- He's my neighbor. He joined the Qiyuan Sect last year. 
 - Move back!

320
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,460
He donated all his family property and made his wife so angry she died.

321
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,000
You lackeys should have died long ago!

322
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
Where's Zuo Guanren? Call him out here! Zuo Guanren!

323
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:43,040
- I can't see either. 
 - Get down. What are you looking at?

324
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,820
What are you looking at?

325
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,679
Stop deceiving the common people.

326
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,040
Call Zuo Guanren out here! Zuo Guanren!

327
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,040
My Lord, how far has the drama progressed?

328
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,319
Zuo Guanren, if you don't come out, I'll kill her! I'll kill my daughter!

329
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,439
How is Lu Dazhi's performance?

330
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,150
Not bad.

331
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,392
I found him.

332
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,260
Zuo Guanren!

333
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,300
   

334
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,379
 It's Leader Zuo. Leader Zuo has come out. 

335
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:28,680
 - Leader Zuo has come out. 
 - It's Leader Zuo. 

336
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,099
 This is Leader Zuo. 

337
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,619
Why are those crazy ones here?

338
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,280
- What? 
 - Don't move.

339
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,100
- Don't move. 
 - My Lord, I need to verify something.

340
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,079
 Laying hands on a child? 

341
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,652
 Yeah. 

342
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,760
I am Zuo Guanren. 
    

343
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,120
Zuo Guanren, you thief! You finally showed up!

344
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,640
Everyone take a good look! This is Zuo Guanren!

345
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,040
He slaughtered our sect leader and persecuted our buddies!

346
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,500
He obstructs the great rise of our sect. You've done all the evil you could!

347
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,339
Stop talking nonsense!

348
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:13,568
The Qiyuan Sect has committed numerous evils.

349
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:18,459
They bewitch people and destroy families, provoking great wrath.

350
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:22,632
If we were to turn a blind eye, wouldn't that dishearten the people?

351
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:23,788
 - Right. 
 - Yeah! 

352
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,872
 - Exactly! 
 - Yeah! 

353
00:30:28,104 --> 00:30:29,920
Shut up!

354
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,499
Zuo Guanren, you're talking nonsense. Today, I'm going to tell you.

355
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,079
From now on, you're not allowed to sabotage our sect. Do you hear me?!

356
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,859
The Righteous Martial Alliance never lets go of evildoers.

357
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:43,679
If you have a shred of humanity left, let go of your daughter.

358
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,379
Just agree to him first to save that young girl.

359
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:51,459
No, that'll only encourage the Qiyuan Sect to capture more people to threaten them.

360
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,348
We must save the person.

361
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,339
 - Doing this sort of thing. 
 - Is there such a father? 

362
00:30:57,339 --> 00:31:00,630
 Really. Don't you feel pity? 

363
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,760
 How will this child face things when she grows up? 

364
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,439
Wen Yang, quick!

365
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,300
Yes.

366
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,719
Don't move! No one come over here! Do you hear me?!

367
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,640
To eliminate dissenters, you even don't care about a life!

368
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,540
You forced me into this!

369
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,559
Today, I will ascend with my daughter, using blood as our foundation!

370
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,640
Wait! Wait.

371
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,200
Maybe Jinzhao has a plan.

372
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
Young Jinzhao has his own tricks.

373
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,120
Wait. Wait.

374
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,439
Stop right there!

375
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,679
Brother, we're on the same side. Same side.

376
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,719
To be honest, I've been displeased with the Righteous Martial Alliance for a long time.

377
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:41,799
Under the guise of eliminating the sect, they're just seeking fame and fortune!

378
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,710
You all! How dare you offend Lord Ming?

379
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,690
- You're unforgivable! You're asking for death! 
 - Yes.

380
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,640
Brother, congratulations on your successful ascension, but...

381
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,488
But what?

382
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:01,339
But in this world, people die at every moment.

383
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:07,400
Then... how will Lord Ming know you died for the great cause of the sect?

384
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,559
Any disciple loyal to him receives Lord Ming's token.

385
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,619
 What did he take out? 

386
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:26,319
 - Flying. 
 - It's flying. 

387
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,750
It's Lord Ming.

388
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,030
Lord Ming is summoning me!

389
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,960
 I must not let the orb harm Qi. 

390
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,060
I got the token.

391
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,880
I got the token. I have the token!

392
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,280
I got the token!

393
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm going to ascend! I'm going to ascend!

394
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,780
I'm going to ascend to serve Lord Ming!

395
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,479
I'm going to ascend.

396
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:56,799
I'm going to ascend! I'm going to ascend!

397
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,980
 This child must be delirious. 

398
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,760
The Righteous Martial Alliance really lives up to its reputation.

399
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,360
Yes! Look! The one using a hidden weapon

400
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,400
is Wen Yang, Brave Martial Hall Leader. 
    

401
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,760
And that lady is Qiu Lingyun. 
    

402
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,839
She's the head of the Cloud Stairway Hall. She can move very swiftly and lightly.

403
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,579
It's really a place full of talent. Shifang, you're a hall leader, so you're powerful too.

404
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:34,280
Minister Gao. Minister Gao.

405
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,379
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, My Lord.

406
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm sorry, My Lord. I'm sorry.

407
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,400
My apologies. I was just too astonished.

408
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,640
I was so stupid! I shouldn't have trusted you!

409
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Quick, peh, peh, peh!

410
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,859
How can you call yourself stupid?

411
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,940
You are the next one of our sect who will ascend.

412
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,719
How can you say that? Wasn't I just...?

413
00:33:55,719 --> 00:34:00,160
Didn't you say that Lu guy was good at talking?

414
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Didn't you say he could tarnish the reputation of the Righteous Martial Alliance?

415
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,020
How would I know there would be six Cheng Yaojin's? 
  (General from the Tang dynasty) 

416
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,499
But then again, those people are always around.

417
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:16,959
Who can say otherwise?

418
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,880
Thankfully you're here.

419
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,579
Every time, you manage to lead a strategic retreat successfully.

420
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:26,719
These people really are like dog holding onto another dog.

421
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,300
You can't shake them off at all.

422
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,499
Do you understand what I mean?

423
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:37,140
Do you mean to say... we're dogs?

424
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,690
My ass!

425
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,840
- You're a dog! 
 - Yes, yes.

426
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,780
Wh-What I mean to say is,

427
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,719
we can't do anything about those people.

428
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,760
Then let the Righteous Martial Alliance deal with them.

429
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,659
Wouldn't it be easier if you just said it directly?

430
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,440
Continue.

431
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,830
- This time, stay steady for me. 
 - Alright.

432
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:08,579
If you move again, I'll beat you up!

433
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,240
 Amazing. 

434
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,360
 - Wonderful! 
 - Good. 

435
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,960
Are you okay?

436
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,080
Are you okay?

437
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,199
You're fit to be a father?

438
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,156
Alliance Leader.

439
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,660
A small sect like Qiyuan, can even manage to bewitch people

440
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,940
to commit such unconscionable acts.

441
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,379
It fully shows their evil nature.

442
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:06,559
I've long sworn to lead the removal of the sect for the peace of the people.

443
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,039
 - Great! 
 - Good! 

444
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:15,799
 - Wipe out the Qiyuan Sect! 
 - Wipe out the Qiyuan Sect! 

445
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,440
We need to deal with the aftermath.

446
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,699
Please, everyone, disperse.

447
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,514
- Lingyun, take good care of this little girl. 
 - Yes.

448
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:33,560
- Wen Yang. 
 - Yes.

449
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,380
Lock the person up and immediately search his home.

450
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,419
Yes.

451
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:39,300
- Take him away. 
 - Get up. Move.

452
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,039
Thank you all for your assistance.

453
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,260
Come with me to the hall to talk.

454
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,660
Let's all go inside, too.

455
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,030
Don't be afraid. Don't be scared.

456
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,132
It's okay, little one.

457
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,759
Ming Xiu is so gentle. She seems different than how she normally is.

458
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:05,480
Young Xiu must have thought of her childhood.

459
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,239
Childhood? What about it?

460
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,780
There's no need to talk about the past.

461
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,459
Fei'er, be good. Go with that lady in a little while.

462
00:37:40,136 --> 00:37:42,500
 Little girl, stop crying. 

463
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,200
 I've killed the demon already. 

464
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,839
 But my mother... 

465
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,999
 Mother! Mother! 

466
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,290
 Mother!  

467
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,510
 Mother! 

468
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:39,120


469
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:06,496
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

470
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:10,560
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

471
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,904
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

472
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:22,528
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

473
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:26,472
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

474
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:30,420
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:39,428
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

476
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:47,616
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

477
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:55,552
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

479
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:24,612
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

480
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:28,512
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

481
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:33,196
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

482
00:40:35,692 --> 00:40:40,544
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

483
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:49,480
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

484
