00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,764
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,424
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10

♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,900
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,320
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:39,228
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,404
   

19
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:59,916
   

20
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:04,700
   

21
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,519
Who's there?

22
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,939
Alliance Leader Zuo, I am Luo Zhaoyan.

23
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,319
We came abruptly for something urgent.

24
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,868
Jinzhao, will this really work?

25
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:27,149
Rest assured. It's definitely going to work.

26
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:29,708
Come on, repeat what I told you.

27
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,929
Yes. I will defeat you fair and square.

28
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:35,100
And make you beg me for mercy.

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,080
I will defeat you fair and square.

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,761
Go ahead.

31
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,728
Gentlemen.

32
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:47,089
Well, I'm here to do justice to my buddy.

33
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:49,349
Who's making a scene?

34
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,989
- Isn't it Hall Leader Ju who got kicked out? 
 - I will defeat you...

35
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,368
Are you here to beg for your position back?

36
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:01,889
- Defeat you fair and square. 
 - Shifang.

37
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,989
I will beg you for mercy!

38
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,089
No, wait. That was wrong.

39
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:15,825
I will defeat you fair and square and make you beg me for mercy.

40
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:19,491
You can't even speak. And you wish to win?

41
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,469
Come on, guys. I'm sure you know it.

42
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,249
My buddy is the head of the Mechanic Skill Hall in the Righteous Martial Alliance.

43
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,349
He's highly capable.

44
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,648
Unfortunately, his fellow alliance members have been bullying him.

45
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:36,069
Today, I'm going to do him justice...

46
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:39,369
- Defeat them. 
 - And show you what he's capable of.

47
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:41,148
Shifang.

48
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,768
Yes, I'm going to fight you.

49
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:45,468
 - All right! 
 - All right! 

50
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,004
 - All right! 
 - How are you going to fight? 

51
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:52,449
All right.

52
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,048
Let's fight two on two.

53
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:58,048
If we win, you will do something for us.

54
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:02,268
If we lose, then we will do something for you.

55
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:03,728
How about it?

56
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,468
Deal.

57
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,209
It's okay if you lose.

58
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,508
Hall Leader Ju, all we want is to have fun with your bear for a few days.

59
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,648
In your dreams.

60
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,569
 - There. 
 - There. 

61
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:22,909
 - There. 
 - They're starting. 

62
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,549
 - Nice! 
 - Nice! 

63
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:41,008
 - Not bad! 
 - All right! 

64
00:05:44,489 --> 00:05:46,809
 - Nice! 
 - Nice! 

65
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,428
 - Great! 
 - Great! 

66
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,869
I won. Jinzhao, I won!

67
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,569
How are you? Are you okay?

68
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,608
You lost.

69
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,289
We accept our defeat. So, what do you want?

70
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,188
Thirty taels?

71
00:06:21,188 --> 00:06:23,069
Are they beggars?

72
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,089
T-Three hundred taels?

73
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,828
Qianjun, 300 taels.

74
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:34,388
Do we have the money?

75
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:37,169
- Of course not.  
 - What do we do?

76
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:43,109
T-Three thousand taels?

77
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,089
Just kill me...

78
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,028
Bark three times.

79
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,848
You bad guy!

80
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,069
Jinzhao, forget it.

81
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,408
This is too much.

82
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:59,068
See, Hall Leader Ju is a reasonable man.

83
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:02,808
Yes. The way I see it,

84
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:05,069
barking once is enough.

85
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:10,488
What was I telling you?

86
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,128
Right. Right.

87
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:17,829
Well, we're here to propose that

88
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:21,389
we join hands to eradicate the Qiyuan Sect.

89
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,049
 - Qiyuan Sect. 
 - Qiyuan Sect. 

90
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,688
 Qiyuan Sect. 

91
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,869
Qianjun. Qiming.

92
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:33,969
You lost because you haven't mastered the moves.

93
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,028
Practice harder.

94
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,508
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

95
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:41,408
People of the Brave Martial Hall should keep their word.

96
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:44,028
Qianjun, apologize to Hall Leader Ju.

97
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,948
Hall Leader Ju, I'm sorry.

98
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,828
We've done you wrong.

99
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:53,570
Please forgive us.

100
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:56,688
I-It's okay.

101
00:07:56,688 --> 00:08:00,189
Hall Leader Ju is truly magnanimous. I admire you.

102
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:04,429
Young Hero Yue, the alliance leader invites you inside

103
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,749
to discuss the attack on the Qiyuan Sect.

104
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,329
The Qiyuan Sect?

105
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,228
- Great! 
 - Great!

106
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:12,688
Let's go.

107
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,309
What a show you put up out there.

108
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,029
You think you can manipulate me?

109
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,849
We dare not. It's just that we've had some misunderstandings.

110
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:29,269
I was worried that you wouldn't see us without a proper cause.

111
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,089
Young Hero Yue,

112
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,788
you had it all planned and played it out well. What a great team.

113
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:39,049
I truly admire you.

114
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,069
We only came up with this idea because we sincerely wanted to meet you

115
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,929
and discuss our plan against the Qiyuan Sect.

116
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:46,869
Please forgive us.

117
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,508
Where is that wolf demon friend of yours?

118
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,949
Alliance Leader, Senior Xian Qing is a decent man.

119
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,028
I mean, decent demon.

120
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,108
You treated him so poorly.

121
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,268
Xian Qing managed to win your trust.

122
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:10,108
Therefore, I believe he can't be an evil creature.

123
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:13,268
Alliance Leader, you agreed to work with us?

124
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,589
I'm not a stubborn or irrational man.

125
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,788
I can tell right from wrong.

126
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:24,389
The Righteous Martial Alliance will join hands with you against our enemies.

127
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,968
I have a letter from an old friend.

128
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:36,868
Inside is nothing but enumerations of my wrongdoings.

129
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,709
Miss Ming.

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,309
   

131
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,088
It's Master's handwriting.

132
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,388
Miss Ming, what did Senior Gu write?

133
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,849
Straight to the point. Polite but harsh.

134
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,429
That's Senior Gu's style.

135
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,309
I bet Xian Qing told Senior Gu about what was going on.

136
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,708
You said that there is a stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect at the Yinma River.

137
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,908
- Are you sure about it? 
 - Absolutely.

138
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:17,849
All right. To keep it a secret,

139
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:21,129
you'd better go there as soon as possible.

140
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,729
That's our plan.

141
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:28,049
This time, I'm going to assign you some of my top disciples.

142
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:30,289
They've dealt with the Qiyuan Sect before.

143
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:35,589
I believe they'll help you destroy the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

144
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,128
Thank you, Alliance Leader.

145
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:54,749
Shifang,

146
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:58,820
are you upset because of how Alliance Leader Zuo treated you?

147
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,929
You can tell?

148
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:06,368
I bet he's very disappointed in me.

149
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,128
Master Luo and I saw something different.

150
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,749
 Alliance Leader. Alliance Leader. 

151
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,829
 Hall Leader Ju won! 

152
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:28,269
You mean Alliance Leader Zuo was happy that I won the fight?

153
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:32,369
He had high expectations for you.

154
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:35,768
I thought he was mad because of Senior Xian Qing.

155
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,809
He was happy that you helped your friend.

156
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,428
That's right.

157
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:42,988
Shifang.

158
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:44,929
A'Yang.

159
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:48,349
Shifang, the alliance leader sent me to accommodate you.

160
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,980
As before, you're staying in the Mechanic Skill Hall.

161
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,108
Mechanic Skill Hall?

162
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:56,868
He never said anything about demoting you.

163
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:02,609
Shifang, you won against Chen Qianjun and Xu Qiming.

164
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:05,448
Many people have changed their opinions about you.

165
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,689
When destroying the stronghold at the Yinma River,

166
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,328
you should show them what you've really got.

167
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:14,368
You'll remain as the head of the Mechanic Skill Hall.

168
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:18,489
I promise I won't let any of you down.

169
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,568
All right, I'll leave you to rest.

170
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,809
All right, stop being in a daze.

171
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:35,629
Tomorrow, there's a tough battle to fight.

172
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:40,448
Shifang, what did we tell you?

173
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:59,408
How do I find a way to remove the Companion Life Spell?

174
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,709
They left you this.

175
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,520
A paper crane?

176
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:40,650
It's obviously from Sister Ming Xiu.

177
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,410
I thought she would ignore me.

178
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:53,268
 Young Yue, this kaleidoscope is full of pretty patterns. 

179
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:55,988
 Take a look whenever you miss us. 

180
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:08,888
 Miss Yue, keep this dagger for self-defense. 

181
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,589
Wolf-fur duster?

182
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,988
I bet it's from Xian Qing.

183
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,248
So handy.

184
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:04,428
 Miss Shuo Xuan, I'm leaving the Sea of Clear Skies today. 

185
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,708
 This one. This is for you. 

186
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,609
 I'm not interested in these things. 

187
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:24,289
Who'd want your gift?

188
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,768
 Come, Jinzhao. 

189
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,028
 Candied hawthorns! 

190
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:53,530
Qi.

191
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,669
 Candied hawthorns! 

192
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:18,448
- Visit again. 
 - Thank you.

193
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:21,008
Young Master Yue.

194
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,208
Want some pastries?

195
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,969
Do you want your usual?

196
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:30,248
- All right. 
 - All right.

197
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:32,028
Why are you alone today?

198
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,508
Where is your wife?

199
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:36,388
At her maiden home.

200
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:40,388
You should get her back as soon as possible.

201
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:48,020
Here. One extra plum blossom pancake for her.

202
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,089
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

203
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,669
Thank you.

♫  A butterfly drifts along ones fingertips, yet no one notices  ♫

205

♫  The snow accidentally falls on my forehead and awakens the past  ♫

206
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:36,872
♫  Unable to escape fate's calamity, or the emotions of the mortal world  ♫

207

♫  In this lifetime, I will only ever care for one person  ♫

♫  No matter how many lifetimes pass, that fate will never be fulfilled  ♫

209
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:50,104
♫  Afraid of the vast ocean, of the changing fields  ♫

210
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:54,264
♫  Afraid of not being able to say goodbye  ♫

211
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:58,711
♫  Afraid there's only longing left in the memories  ♫

00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:03,630
♫  Afraid of not recognizing you when we meet again  ♫

♫  Afraid of dreams, of parting  ♫

217
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:27,020
 Regardless of what our relationship is, we'll always be together anyway. 

218
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,688
 It's all right. I'll be your life companion from now on. 

219
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,488
 Are you going to abandon me? 

220
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,529
Qi.

221
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,569
Thinking about Young Yue?

222
00:19:06,568 --> 00:19:11,032
I wonder how she's doing at the Sea of Clear Skies.

223
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:15,288
She's the young lord of the Yu Clan.

224
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,629
I bet she's doing well.

225
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,309
Yes.

226
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,529
She's the young lord now.

227
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,060
She must be doing well.

228
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,489
Honestly, I understand you.

229
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,089
It's like... It's like Dou Bao and I.

230
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:48,728
If Dou Bao leaves me out of the blue, I'd be in pain for ages just like you.

231
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:52,028
You and Young Yue have been together for so long.

232
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:55,648
It's normal for you to miss her.

233
00:19:55,648 --> 00:20:00,329
 Is it really that Miss Yue can't live without you or you can't live without Miss Yue? 

234
00:20:31,528 --> 00:20:36,889
Well, did I say something wrong again?

235
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,009
No.

236
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,408
You're right.

237
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,928
It is me who cannot live without her.

238
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:00,209
It has always been me who can't live without her.

239
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:05,528
It is me.

240
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,969
It is me.

241
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,920
   

242
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:50,409
Everyone, we're joining hands today to eradicate the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

243
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,209
Please forget about our past grudges.

244
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,168
Eradicating them for the sake of the people is part of the Luo family's duty.

245
00:21:56,168 --> 00:21:59,648
Hall Leader Wen, rest assured. We'll work together.

246
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,849
Everyone, the Righteous Martial Alliance, the Luo family,

247
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:10,069
and these young heroes are allying today to eradicate the Qiyuan Sect.

248
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:16,489
 - Eradicate the Qiyuan sect. 
 - Eradicate the Qiyuan sect. 

249
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:24,588
♫  I've never dreamed of the world   ♫

250
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:29,288
 Qi should have been here with us. 

251
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:33,029
Young Hero Yue, do you want to say something?

252
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,969
May we succeed. Eradicate the Qiyuan sect.

253
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:43,448
 May we succeed. Eradicate the Qiyuan sect. 

254
00:22:43,448 --> 00:22:50,928
 May we succeed. Eradicate the Qiyuan sect.

♫  This destined path is full of turbulence,   ♫

00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:04,376

264
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,629
Meng Cheng.

265
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,969
Any good news, Minister?

266
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:48,129
An edict came from Shengxuan

267
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:52,048
that I shall gather all the ministers

268
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:55,668
and take the matured Qiyuan Orb to the headquarters.

269
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:59,469
Tell me. What does it mean?

270
00:23:59,469 --> 00:24:02,829
I-It's quite obvious.

271
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:06,688
Among all the ministers of the Qiyuan Sect, you're the most respected.

272
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:08,949
I believe Shengxuan issued this edict

273
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:12,548
for you to show up in front of all our fellow disciples

274
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:17,768
before making you the next sect leader.

275
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:18,989
It is urgent.

276
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:23,168
I'd better get ready and head to the headquarters.

277
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,648
Minister.

278
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:32,808
You're about to be made the sect leader.

279
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:35,168
The Langyin Pavilion...

280
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:41,249
Enough. I'll make you the minister of Langyin Pavilion.

281
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:44,129
- Take great care of it. 
 - All right.

282
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,288
- You hear me? 
 - Yes.

283
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:12,309
The entrance to Langyin Pavilion must be nearby.

284
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,028
Why don't we split up?

285
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:16,709
It's a difficult terrain. We should stay close.

286
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,748
Let's go in pairs. Keep in touch.

287
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:20,028
All right.

288
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,548
Let's go.

289
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:27,368
- Shifang, let's go. 
 - All right.

290
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,000
Old Xu,

291
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,700
I don't get it. Why did Hall Leader Wen send two untrustworthy guys with us as scouts

292
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,189
and stay on standby with Master Luo and Miss Ming at the foot of the mountain?

293
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:47,729
I believe there is a good reason.

294
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:33,129
Footprints.

295
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:39,868
Watch out!

296
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:52,970
Thank you for saving my life.

297
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:56,069
How did you know it was a trap?

298
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,668
The footprints looked artificial. I knew it was fishy.

299
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:03,849
You're truly observant. I admire you.

300
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:06,689
- It's nothing. Stay alert. 
 - Yes.

301
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,109
If there's a trap here,

302
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:11,109
then the entrance to the Qiyuan Sect must be close by.

303
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,508
Yes.

304
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:16,489
- Are you okay, Old Xu? 
 - I'm fine. Young Hero Yue saved me.

305
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:17,788
Jinzhao.

306
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,868
Jinzhao, I heard something from the stone wall.

307
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,229
I think the stronghold is behind there.

308
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:25,849
- Let's go take a look. 
 - All right.

309
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:42,768
Captives.

310
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:58,928
I didn't expect this stronghold to be so heavily guarded.

311
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,709
It's going to be a tough battle.

312
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:04,469
Let's get down the mountain and inform Hall Leader Wen first.

313
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:06,669
- All right. 
 - Wait.

314
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:13,369
It's just the Langyin Pavilion. Shifang and I can handle it.

315
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:17,189
Someone really knows how to bluff.

316
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:20,369
Qianjun, let's wait and see what Young Hero Yue is up to.

317
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:23,388
Qianjun, let's wait and see what Young Hero Yue is up to.

318
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:29,788
Jinzhao, so that's why you told me to make the masks?

319
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:33,528
Chances favor those who are prepared.

320
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,389
Who are you?

321
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:52,788
Get your minister here.

322
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:56,309
How dare you ask to see Minister Meng?

323
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,249
Are you seeking death?

324
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,908
Guards!

325
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:05,209
Let me see who's so bold.

326
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:09,089
How dare you ask to see me?

327
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,349
Lord Shengxuan, please forgive me.

328
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,268
How dare you! Lord Shengxuan is here.

329
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:21,889
Where are your manners? Get lost!

330
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:24,928
Get lost. Hurry up.

331
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,900
Young Hero Yue is really smart.

332
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,149
- And you are... 
 - Me?

333
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:37,148
I am Shengxuan's bodyguard.

334
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:39,009
Nice to meet you, sir.

335
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:43,089
Lord Shengxuan, may I ask what brought you here?

336
00:29:48,048 --> 00:29:50,109
W-What does it mean?

337
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:52,768
You don't do your job well.

338
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,949
Lord Shengxuan worked all day and got sick.

339
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,288
He can't talk now.

340
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,808
You've been made the minister. How come you don't understand what he wants?

341
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:03,648
Yes, you're right.

342
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:16,908
Lord means our strongholds are getting eradicated one after another.

343
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,109
Only you guys are doing well.

344
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,568
Let's try to barge in later.

345
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:27,269
Exactly. The stronghold here is heavily guarded.

346
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Is Lord Shengxuan going to... reward me?

347
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,400
Punish me.

348
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,900
I'm sorry. My apologies.

349
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,700
My apologies.

350
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,100
Lord Shengxuan means that you've done a great job.

351
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,800
You deserve some rewards, so he's taking you somewhere.

352
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
Thank you, Lord Shengxuan.

353
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,700
Go!

354
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,300
You're disguising as me?

355
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,800
Yue Jinzhao, you've learned a trick or two.

356
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Meng Cheng, it's been so long.

357
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,200
Who are you?

358
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
So it's you, you brat.

359
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
You look so much like Shengxuan with the mask on.

360
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Where is the headquarters?

361
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,500
I'm loyal to Lord Ming. I won't tell you where it is.

362
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,000
All right.

363
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,700
D-Don't kill me.

364
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,300
Tell me exactly where your headquarters is.

365
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,200
Fine. I'll tell you.

366
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,400
Excuse me. Have you heard of the Life Companion Spell?

367
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,100
Life Companion Spell?

368
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,000
It's a spell that removes one's memories and personality.

369
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,900
Remember what I told you?

370
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,700
 It's at his place. 

371
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,500
- Excuse me. Have you heard of the Companion Life Spell? 
 - Companion Life Spell?

372
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,300
Have you?

373
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,200
We are both viviparous species. We've never heard of companion life.

374
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
Right.

375
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,900
- Never heard of it. 
 - Never heard of it.

376
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,200
Grandpa.

377
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,100
Do you know about the Companion Life Spell?

378
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,000
- What spell? 
 - Companion Life Spell.

379
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
What spell?

380
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,900
Companion Life Spell.

381
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,500
Young Lord,

382
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,600
if you want to study, read the books in the hall.

383
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,000
In my lifetime, I've not once touched a book.

384
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,300
I don't want to read a book.

385
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Read books?

386
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,200
Meditation Spell.

387
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,569
Meditation Spell.

388
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,600
It allows people to enter the sea of awareness of any creature.

389
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,500
If I enter Zhu Yu's sea of awareness,

390
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,300
then I'll find a way to remove the Companion Life Spell.

391
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,969
Whose sea of awareness is it?

392
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,400
 Life is so hard. 

393
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,849
You're the lantern.

394
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,700
So you're alive.

395
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,200
 I've been a lantern for ages. 

396
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,300
 I forgot that I'm a living fish. 

397
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,000
 Why do I lead such a miserable life? 

398
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,200
 Why do I have to work so hard? 

399
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,900
Work?

400
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
What do you do?

401
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,100
 I emit light and heat to light up the street for the Yu people. 

402
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,800
 Why do we have to work? 

403
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,200
 Why can't I lie back and do nothing? 

404
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,800
 I've been working for 300 years. 

405
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,000
 When is it ever going to end? 

406
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,800
 Life is so hard. 

407
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,400
The Meditation Spell worked.

408
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:06,000


409
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,000
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

410
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

411
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

412
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,900
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,000

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,400
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

421
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

422
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,100
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

423
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,100
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

424
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,000
♫  Alone in the empty valley I hear my echo  ♫

429

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,600

433
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
♫  Wait until the wind rises and the rain ceases  ♫

434
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,100
♫  Wait for the long lost silence  ♫

435
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,100
♫  Wait until we are close   ♫

436
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,900
