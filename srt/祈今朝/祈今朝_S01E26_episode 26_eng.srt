2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,864
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,832
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,424
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:38,276
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,472
   

19
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:59,996
   

20
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,519
Miss Shuo Xuan, now that the Bloodbinding has been undone,

21
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,839
Rehai will return to its wandering orbit.

22
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,074
I wonder if Her Lordship has a plan in mind.

23
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:26,414
How are you to know the whereabouts of Rehai when the time comes?

24
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,740
Stop beating around the bush. What are you trying to say?

25
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,400
That day, Her Lordship and I coerced Ying Xuwei to hand over the method to undo the Bloodbinding.

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,120
He has long held a grudge against me,

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,439
but could do nothing to me because I possessed Rehai.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,380
This scroll records the trajectory of Rehai.

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,960
I've heard the Yu Clan keeps its word.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,199
If you and Her Lordship are willing to ensure my safety,

31
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,540
I shall certainly reciprocate and give you the scroll.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,860
What are you two talking about?

33
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:24,469
I'm just a bit curious. What does the Yu Clan need Rehai for?

34
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:28,100
This seems to have nothing to do with you anymore. Right?

35
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,119
I've sensed Qi.

36
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,111
I worried that she might have been hurt in these past few battles,

37
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:59,255
so I brought her back for a thorough examination.

38
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,080
It's best if it's as you say.

39
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,195
Eldest Brother, the matter of Young Master Luo has been settled.

40
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,690
Then bring out the key ring of Rehai.

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,820
Your Lordship, you can verify it for yourself.

42
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:44,929
Your Lordship...

43
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:50,149
Your Lordship, we had an agreement before.

44
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,800
This key ring is to be guarded by our sect.

45
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,859
Are you planning to break the agreement?

46
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,600
The transaction is complete. I shall take my leave.

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,859
Qingfei, see him out.

48
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:19,959
All right.

49
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,170
The Yujie Hub is atop the paramount peak.

50
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,229
I do require someone to escort me down the mountain.

51
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,260
But the flying mechanism of the Hengdao Sect is not a good choice.

52
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,019
I wonder if you're willing to escort me down the mountain, Your Lordship?

53
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,440
Your Lordship, we are going down the mountain anyway.

54
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,780
Why not let Young Master Luo join us?

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,390
Thank you, Your Lordship.

56
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,484
Father.

57
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,096
 Father. 

58
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,640
 This is not an inner orb, 

59
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,221
 but a pill refined from their own energy by a demon. 

60
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,955
 Which demon is so foolish that he gave it to you? 
   

61
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:02,399
 I have made an agreement with that wolf demon. 

62
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,799
 He used half of his energy to save my daughter. 

63
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,820
 In three months, I will return to let it devour me. 

64
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,724
 Maiming. 

65
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,320
 If this can successfully prolong Zhaoyan's life, 

66
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,731
 my death will be worth it. 

67
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,027
 You have to stand him up. 

68
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,500
 What does that mean? 

69
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,220
 The demonic power in this pill cannot be utilized by me. 

70
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:37,300
 It seems that as long as the condemnation of Heaven exists, 

71
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,839
 I cannot replenish my Vitality Energy from other sources. 

72
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:45,759
 But you can have Zhaoyan take it and see. 

73
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,939
 I'm just afraid that until she dies, 

74
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,800
 this demonic power will just dissipate in vain. 

75
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,559
 Damn this condemnation of Heaven! 

76
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,130
 Zhaoyan. 

77
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,000
 Zhaoyan is such a good child. 

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,540
 Luo Wangping, if I tell Zhaoyan... 

79
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:13,259
 that as a twin of our family, she is destined to die young... 

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,380
 because I stole half her life, 

81
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,160
 would she be so nice to me? 

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,280
 She regards you as her most important elder brother. 

83
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:37,639
 Don't you have even a bit of familial affection in your heart? 

84
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:41,569
 Familial affection? After I was first reborn, 

85
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:47,579
 I told the elders of the family that Bloodbinding Rehai contravened the Heavenly Laws... 

86
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,779
 and that we would all suffer from the condemnation of Heaven. 

87
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,480
 Guess what their reaction was? 

88
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:58,805
 To prevent me from undoing the Bloodbinding 

89
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,160
 and causing the family to lose the water supply of Rehai, 

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,639
 the family master then, my elder brother in my first life, 

91
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,499
 decisively ordered my execution. 

92
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,120
 Luo Wangping, you are a smart person. 

93
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,859
 You can do many things for me, who cannot leave the mansion. 

94
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:25,259
 So far, you've been a good ally. 

95
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,079
 You can leave. I will inform you of my new ideas. 

96
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:35,639
 I hope we can continue to cooperate happily. 

97
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,639
 Zhaoyan. Zhaoyan. 

98
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,779
 Stop hiding. I know you're there. 

99
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,800
 No, I'm not here. 

100
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,359
I'm not here.

101
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,964
Zhaoyan.

102
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:26,183
I'm not here.

103
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,252
How is Zhaoyan doing?

104
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,240
I cast a calming spell on her to let her sleep well.

105
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Any news about Young Yue?

106
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,700
Judging from the current situation, they wouldn't harm Qi.

107
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,980
The problem is...

108
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,140
that no one knows where the Yujie Hub is.

109
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,480
I also can't sense the Sea of Clear Skies.

110
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,240
The best option is to wait.

111
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,295
Wait for them to come to me.

112
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
Don't worry. We will find Young Yue.

113
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,160
You stay with Zhaoyan.

114
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,580
I'll go and look again to see if there's any sign of Qi.

115
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,413
My master wants to see you.

116
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,834
You dare to come back?

117
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:51,759
I've returned because my only kin is here.

118
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:01,354
Since you can't let go,

119
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,560
you shouldn't have destroyed the things she cared about.

120
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,310
What?

121
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,700
You want to kill me?

122
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,419
For 200 years, I've been putting up with the misery.

123
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:34,600
Dying at your hands now would be a release.

124
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,399
With your current level of skill,

125
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,480
you're merely an ant beneath my feet.

126
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,959
What? Should I thank you for your mercy?

127
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,239
You drove Zhaoyan out of the Luo family and sent her to Mangwan Village.

128
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:05,859
You spared no effort to protect her, even annihilating the entire family.

129
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,652
Luo Maiming,

130
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,059
should I say you are pitiable or detestable?

131
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,120
Say it.

132
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,870
What is the real reason you've come to me?

133
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,999
I came here...

134
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,710
to confirm whether her choice...

135
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,090
was the correct one.

136
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,700
I still...

137
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,530
can't accept it.

138
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,859
You killed the entire Luo family, and you don't leave a single word of remorse?

139
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,239
Remorse?

140
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,839
Between you and me,

141
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:52,099
I can hardly tell who's more like a demon.

142
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,668
This place is...

143
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,592

169
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,560
Qi.

170
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,299
Only Jinzhao can call me Qi.

171
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,020
But do you know the origin of your name?

172
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,940
At that time, you had just been born.

173
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,999
Eldest Brother and I went to the Sea of Clear Skies to take you to the Yujie Hub to raise you.

174
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,060
 She's so adorable. 

175
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,680
 We will take her back to the Yujie Hub and raise her well. 

176
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,180
 Her name is... 

177
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,540
 Qi. 

178
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,519
Qi signifies good wishes.

179
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,660
She hoped you'd be happy and safe.

180
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,135
Happy and safe.

181
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,979
I'll take you to a place. Okay?

182
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,540
Why did you bring me here?

183
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,060
You have left something here.

184
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,984
These are...

185
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,187
Each star...

186
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,820
represents a memory of yours.

187
00:25:17,227 --> 00:25:18,915
So...

188
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:24,413
you wiped out my memories?

189
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,576
Yes.

190
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,719
You manipulated everything in my life?

191
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,532
Yes.

192
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,336
Am I...

193
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:58,680
a pawn in your game?

194
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,744
Yes.

195
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,960
What on earth do you want?

196
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,740
If you don't tell me, I'll find out myself.

197

♫  The branches break in exchange for memories  ♫

203
00:27:38,048 --> 00:27:41,488
You shouldn't have treated Xiao Huan that way just now.

204
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,060
Even you've learned to eavesdrop, Commander Ge.

205
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:52,100
You only saw Xiao Huan's surveillance and schemes against you.

206
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,419
In fact, he's done a lot for you, you just don't know it.

207
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:58,528
I don't want to know.

208
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:01,919
He once swore to Heaven...

209
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,800
that he would absolutely not use the Resonance Spell on you.

210
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,780
Otherwise, he would suffer the divine punishment of burning.

211
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:14,600
But Xiao Huan broke his oath twice for you.

212
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:20,520
The first time was in the Luori Village,

213
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,496
when you were in a deep coma and it was hard to control your poison.

214
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,200
He used the Resonance Spell to alleviate your pain without hesitation.

215
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,996
 Qi, 

216
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,328
 I once swore not to use this spell. 

217
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,260
 But the poison is too severe. I have no choice but to do it. 

218
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:09,172
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

219
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:15,384
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

220
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:20,560

221
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,200
 Physician Bian, thank you for saving me last night. 

222
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,540
 You woke up because of your abundant spiritual power. 

223
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:29,047
And the second time.

224
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:33,627
The second time was at the Qiyuan Sect's headquarters.

225
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:40,120
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

226
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,764
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, 
 your hope, that one moment  ♫

227
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,840
 Was he afraid that I would lose my mind at that time? 

228
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,879
Young Jinzhao has sent a letter. He's waiting for us in the Yinghui Fort.

229
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:16,519
Let's go there now to meet with him.

230
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,028
Okay.

231
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,320
Who are you?

232
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,920
Are you allies of Luo Zhaoyan?

233
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,639
Where is Luo Zhaoyan? Tell us!

234
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:32,858
- Tell us!  
 - Say it!

235
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,180
You are here for revenge against Luo Zhaoyan, too?

236
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,260
My wife and I returned home to attend the Luo Family's grand ceremony.

237
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,940
But my wife was struck by an evil spell and was greatly weakened.

238
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:54,280
Those who ran out said everyone under the evil spell died.

239
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,892
How did she survive?

240
00:30:55,892 --> 00:30:58,800
I've heard Luo Zhaoyan has a twin sister named Luo Maiming.

241
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Let us see her face.

242
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,940
Yes, have her turn her face and let us take a look.

243
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,920
Otherwise, we will take matters into our own hands.

244
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,509
 - Right, turn around. 
 - Turn around. 

245
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,109
 - Turn around. 
 - Turn around. 

246
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:11,312
Xian Qing.

247
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:17,860
Don't be foolish. You didn't kill them.

248
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,180
Someone must give them an explanation.

249
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,124
What's going on?

250
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,639
She really looks like Luo Zhaoyan.

251
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:37,040
She must be Luo Zhaoyan's sister, Luo Maiming.

252
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,719
Say it! Where is your brother?

253
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,680
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

254
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,160
I was disguised as a man before, and there was a reason for it.

255
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,919
I failed to realize and stop the slaughter in time. I deserve to die.

256
00:31:56,479 --> 00:32:00,379
If my death can appease your hatred,

257
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:03,339
I will do it.

258
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,759
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

259
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,960
 Avenge our clansmen! 

260
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

261
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,201
 Avenge our clansmen! 

262
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:21,040
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

263
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,159
Xian Qing.

264
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,696
Stand up.

265
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,180
Zhaoyan, I have indulged your pride and caprice.

266
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,280
Now it's my willful time.

267
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,120
Xian Qing.

268
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:04,019
Such a lively scene!

269
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,100
Luo Maiming, how dare you show up?

270
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,530
Luo Maiming. He is Luo Maiming.

271
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,161
He is Luo Maiming?

272
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,639
The clothes of the person upstairs did resemble his.

273
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:22,479
Why bother with details? Just kill them both.

274
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,850
After all, they are siblings.

275
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,787
They must both be involved in this bloody matter.

276
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,700
If you all can't discern right from wrong,

277
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,039
let's see.

278
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,560
Did you truly kill the members of the Luo family?

279
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,216
Was it really all your doing?

280
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,840
Of course.

281
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,599
 - It was him.  
 - You beast!

282
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,398
- He did it. 
  - He did it. 

283
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:58,639
For dozens of miles around, everyone relies on the water source here for survival.

284
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:01,680
Do you know where this water comes from?

285
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,840
The ancestors of the Luo family

286
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,324
exchanged the early death of the Luo's twins for inexhaustible water!

287
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,550
 - Is what he's saying true? 
 - What happened? 

288
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:17,200
You're standing on the bones of the twins without shame,

289
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,100
feasting on their blood and flesh!

290
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:25,300
Let me ask you all one question.

291
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,800
Do the twins owe you anything?

292
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,660
Maiming, don't say any more.

293
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,399
You pity them...

294
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,280
and are willing to lay down your life for them.

295
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,040
I am not.

296
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,080
Even if your fates are tragic, even if you brought the water source,

297
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,690
does that mean you can kill?

298
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,229
Yes. I don't care what your reasons are.

299
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:10,999
I only know blood for blood.

300
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:15,319
Luo Maiming, you killed the entire clan.

301
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:17,680
You should repay with your life.

302
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,408
 - Right, blood for blood!  
 - Repay with your life!

303
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,692
 - Blood for blood! 
 - Die for it! 

304
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:24,462
- Great. 
  - Die! 

305
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,436
Blood for blood.

306
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,240
You didn't repay enough yesterday!

307
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,899
Murderer!

308
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,742
Maiming.

309
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:13,050

00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:58,176
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

321
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,828
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

322
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:02,168
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

323
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:07,420
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

324
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,420
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

325
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,516
♫  Alone in the empty valley I hear my echo  ♫

326
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,468
♫  In the tranquility of this world   ♫

327
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:19,516
♫  I'm searching for your presence   ♫

328
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:23,548
♫  I'll spend the rest of my life with you   ♫

329
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:27,392
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

330
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:32,120
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

331
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,792
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

332
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,964
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

333
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:42,780
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

334
00:37:57,404 --> 00:38:01,408
♫  Wait until the wind rises and the rain ceases  ♫

335
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:05,436
♫  Wait for the long lost silence  ♫

336
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:09,404
♫  Wait until we are close   ♫

337
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:13,248
♫  And watch the North Star  ♫

338
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:17,376
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

339
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:21,204
♫  The stories leave no trace behind  ♫

340
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:23,356
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

341
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:25,400
♫  I fill the page with my memories   ♫

342
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,156
♫  All about you  ♫

343
