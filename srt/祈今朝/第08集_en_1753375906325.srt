00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,400
Let's eat.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay, wait a minute.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,680
Hurry up.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,280
What do you want to eat, Shifang?

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,080
Which one do you want to eat, Shifang?

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
Or this one?

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,480
Sir, what would you like to eat?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's order when everyone is here.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Okay.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,080
Xiao Zhaoyan, sit.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
Xiao Zhaoyan, sit.

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
What are you doing?

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I'm giving flowers.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Jinzhao, come and eat.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,280
Sir, order please.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Coming.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Dear guests,

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
do you want to order the mixed or the plain one?

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Or the plain one?

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
The plain one, please.

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,880
No need to look.

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Order the best dish here.

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Okay.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Wait, two dishes.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Okay.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Sir,

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
there are mosquitoes and spiders in your restaurant.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
Let the mosquitoes get rid of the bugs.

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Yes, yes.

32
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Okay.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
Xiao Yue, Xiao Yue.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
Didn't you say you wanted to make the tofu buns burn?

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
This is the paint I designed last night.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Look.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
Dr. Bian is in a good mood

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
as a prisoner.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,880
This flower is called night incense.

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,280
When the flower blooms, it takes its leaves into the medicine.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,480
It has the effect of calming the spirit and nourishing the aura.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Brother Xianqing,

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
can I try it?

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
No need.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Thank you.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Look.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Here.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
And here.

49
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Excuse me.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
Is the guest staying in the hotel?

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
No need.

52
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Let's eat.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Xiao Zhao Yan.

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Xiao Zhao Yan, you're not my master.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
How is it?

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
It's delicious.

58
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
It's okay.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
It's okay.

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Just take a break.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
It's not a good habit to be a wall.

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
You'd better stay and rest.

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
There are only three rooms left in the hotel.

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
You have to stay.

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Xiao Zhao Yan is not feeling well.

66
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
I'll take care of him.

67
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
We'll go together.

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Senior.

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Senior.

70
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Sir, let me do it.

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll do it.

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
It has nothing to do with me.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
It's not up to you.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Shi Feng.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Follow him.

76
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Okay.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Let's go.

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Zhao Yan is in an emergency.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
He's been so good all the way.

80
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
He's really the master of Luo family.

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
He was fine before.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
He's been sick twice today.

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Is he too tired?

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
If you like flowers, I'll give you something else.

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
This is not okay.

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
I'll take care of him.

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Senior.

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
I need to talk to you about something.

89
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Let's talk outside.

90
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I'll go.

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Stay here.

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't play tricks.

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Brother Qi.

94
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Do you want some tea?

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I won't accept

96
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
the false feelings of the enemy.

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
You've been staring at me.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Aren't your eyes tired?

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
This is also the task I'm assigned this morning.

100
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I can only succeed, not fail.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Nan Min.

102
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Zhao Yan.

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Today, the curse has been cast.

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
You've been suffering again.

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
I love you.

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
You've been absent for a long time.

107
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Aren't you going to seek the method of curing the curse?

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
You won't change your mind.

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I won't either.

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I won't talk to you for now.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
He's really hot-tempered.

115
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Xiao Zhao Yan.

117
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Senior.

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm fine now.

119
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I just have some problems.

120
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I'll be fine after a rest.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Xiao Xiu is here.

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Let her take a look for you.

123
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Jin Zhao.

124
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
You can't say anything in your room.

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
You have to say it outside.

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
You're being too loud.

127
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,900
This fell from the

128
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,480
Bailong Huai last night.

129
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
It's the same as the way I braid my hair.

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
I suspect that it has something to do with your background.

131
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
No wonder I feel that

132
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Dr. Bian is a bit like my master in my dream.

133
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Qing.

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Let's check on her.

135
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Master Luo is weak.

136
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
You can rest well.

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you, Miss Ming.

138
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Xiao Zhao Yan, you can rest well.

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Thank you, Senior.

140
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Xiao Xiu.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
You seemed to have something to say.

142
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
I find that

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Luo Zhao Yan's vitality is constantly losing.

144
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
It's like something is constantly devouring him.

145
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Rather than saying that it's an old disease.

146
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
It's more like a curse.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Xiao Xiu.

148
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
The old disease is a disease.

149
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
It's not a disease.

150
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
It's a disease.

151
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
It's a curse.

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Did the two dead demons

153
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
actually have something to do with the curse?

154
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Also,

155
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
when I was trying to cast a spell on him,

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
I found that you spent a lot of your cultivation to give him.

157
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Don't forget, Senior.

158
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Twenty years ago,

159
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I almost died for him.

160
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Their cultivation has already cost me a hundred years of cultivation.

161
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
If I let him die,

162
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm afraid I'll be a little bit unworthy.

163
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
Is it just that you're not willing to accept it?

164
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
You've been living as a wolf demon for a thousand years.

165
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Why do you have to be so concerned about Luo Zhao Yan?

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
A thousand years of no desire,

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I have to find something interesting.

168
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
This is your business.

169
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
It has nothing to do with me.

170
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm just reminding you.

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Don't take it on.

172
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Let my master worry.

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
You're the one who pulled the trigger with Brother Han Jiang.

174
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Why is there only one master

175
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
who is worried about it?

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Miss Min, you're here.

177
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Senior Xian Jing,

178
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
is Zhao Yan all right?

179
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
It's all right.

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I just need to rest well.

181
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
What you want.

182
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Thank you.

183
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
What is this?

184
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Secret.

185
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Let's go.

186
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
We can change shifts.

187
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Let's go.

188
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Let's go.

189
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Let's go.

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Don't forget what I told you before.

191
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
If anything happens, remember to use it.

192
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Xie You Lin, Xie Shu.

193
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Do you want me to make you egg noodles?

194
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Go ahead.

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Miss Yue,

196
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
do you want to play a game?

197
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Okay.

198
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Miss Yue's chess style is really unique.

199
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Doctor Bian,

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,480
did you leave this at Luo's?

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
No.

202
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
It's not mine.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
You're lying.

204
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Jingzhao said

205
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
he saw the grass carp

206
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
fall from you.

207
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Since you know,

208
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
why do you ask?

209
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Because

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
you look like a person

211
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
I know in my dreams.

212
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
In my dream,

213
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
there is also a person

214
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
who can't see clearly.

215
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
He likes to

216
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
wear clothes like this

217
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
like you.

218
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
But in my dream,

219
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
he is very nice to me.

220
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
He taught me how to practice swords.

221
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
He taught me knowledge.

222
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
So I think

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,480
he is not my master.

224
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Everyone has dreams.

225
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
If everyone

226
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
dreams like Miss Yue,

227
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
then life will be a mess.

228
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Impossible.

229
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
I must have a master.

230
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
This is what my master gave me.

231
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
It's exactly the same

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
as your grass carp.

233
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
To you,

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
is your master important?

235
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
In my dream,

236
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I feel warm

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
and close.

238
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I feel like

239
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I can be

240
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
a good person.

241
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I can be

242
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
a good person.

243
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I can be

244
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
a very important person.

245
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
And more importantly,

246
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
as long as I find my master,

247
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Jinzhao and I

248
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
can solve it.

249
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Jinzhao.

250
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Have you ever thought

251
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
if one day

252
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
your master really comes to you,

253
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
will you go with him?

254
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
It's destined that I will

255
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,480
fight for you.

256
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Even if the ending is hard to escape,

257
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I will exchange a little

258
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,480
of the time we spent together.

259
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm so hungry.

260
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Why hasn't Jinzhao come yet?

261
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,480
It seems that Yue has really been nice to you.

262
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Good.

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Jinzhao is a little cheapskate.

264
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
He's always

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
spending more money than me.

266
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
He always scolds me

267
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
and says I'm greedy for fish.

268
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Most importantly,

269
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
every time I eat egg noodles,

270
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
he always steals my eggs.

271
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Jinzhao,

272
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
why are you here?

273
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
You don't go in either?

274
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Qi Yan, let's go.

275
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Let's go out and eat.

276
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I haven't finished asking.

277
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Dr. Bian, tell me quickly.

278
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Where did this grass-fishing fish

279
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
come from?

280
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
In our hometown, everyone changes.

281
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
The style is the same.

282
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Jinzhao.

283
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Jinzhao.

284
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
In the long, long cold winter,

285
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
warm and very considerate,

286
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,480
I invite you to watch the wonderful gathering.

287
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Jinzhao.

288
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Jinzhao, you're angry.

289
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I was just kidding.

290
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I still have a lot of things to do.

291
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
What are you doing?

292
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
But Jinzhao is very smart.

293
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
He can solve

294
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
all the big and small problems.

295
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Jinzhao is very brave.

296
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
No matter what danger happens,

297
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
he can stand out and protect me at once.

298
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Although Jinzhao is very petty,

299
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,480
as long as he has one copper plate,

300
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
he will buy me egg noodles,

301
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
show me the sea of flowers,

302
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
and the butterfly that can shine.

303
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
Jinzhao,

304
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
don't be angry, okay?

305
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
I'm not angry.

306
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Why should I be angry?

307
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
You're lying.

308
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
You're obviously angry.

309
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Then I'm not angry now?

310
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
How did you ask just now?

311
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
What?

312
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Is Bianruohuan your master?

313
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
I don't know.

314
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,480
I don't think so.

315
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
You heard it just now.

316
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
The grass-bent fish is very common

317
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
in his hometown.

318
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I should ask it myself.

319
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
The grass-bent fish can't prove anything.

320
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Sister,

321
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
is it important to you

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
to find the master in the dream?

323
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Of course.

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,480
We've been looking for the body.

325
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
What will you do

326
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
after you find the body?

327
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Jinzhao,

328
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
you're so strange.

329
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
What do you mean by what I will do?

330
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
If one day,

331
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
you find the master in your dream,

332
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
will you go with him?

333
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Have you ever thought

334
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
if one day,

335
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
your master really comes to you,

336
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
will you go with him?

337
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm sorry.

345
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm sorry.

347
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm sorry.

364
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm sorry.

365
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
I've had it.

370
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm sorry.

375
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,800
Little Severalaps's

377
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,160
Sect 이게

378
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,200
胡自屿

379
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
小子

380
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,360
I just want to tell them that I miss them.

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,600
Do it yourself.

382
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I'm fine now.

383
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Don't delay the business.

384
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,760
I told you.

385
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
It's not a good habit to push the wall.

386
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,600
You need to rest more.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,880
Rest...

388
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm much better,

389
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,000
you go to bed.

390
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm going to land.

391
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,680
I just saw

392
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,640
the moon has a beautiful color tonight.

393
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,320
My dad also have the same number as us.

394
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,080
Even you want to get married...

395
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
I want to go out and take a walk.

396
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
Xiao Zhao Yan, don't wait for me.

397
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,040
Go to bed early.

398
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,800
Add있는

399
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,540
Ningxiu,

400
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,080
are you hungry?

401
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,000
I think 119.

402
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
What happened?

403
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Jingzhao asked me just now

404
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
If I find the master in my dream

405
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Will I go with him?

406
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
How did you answer?

407
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
I don't know

408
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
I never thought about this question

409
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
How did Jingzhao come to this?

410
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I don't know

411
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Why did Jingzhao ask such a strange question?

412
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
For important people

413
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Maybe it's easy to change

414
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Where are you looking at the dog?

415
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Wang Wang, Wang Wang, call me

416
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I'll give you chicken legs

417
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
He likes spicy food

418
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Really?

419
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Really

420
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Wang Wang, call me

421
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll give you the most spicy chicken head

422
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Why does the dog learn to bark?

423
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Mom, mom, mom

424
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Mom

425
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
You are so cruel

426
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
I hate spicy food most

427
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Human is so young

428
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
It's so boring

429
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes

430
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Can human be as interesting as your little Zhao Yan?

431
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Of course

432
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Mom

433
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Mom

434
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Mom

435
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Mom

436
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Good morning, everyone

437
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Morning

438
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Morning

439
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Little Zhao Yan

440
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
How did you rest last night?

441
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
I must have had a good rest

442
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
There was a dog that was watching the door last night

443
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
It was guarding the door of Master Luo's room

444
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
Senior Xing Qi, where did you go last night?

445
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Why didn't you come back?

446
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Sorry

447
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Little Zhao Yan is still so polite

448
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Let's go

449
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Go

450
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Stop

451
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,480
You want to escape? It's not that easy

452
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
You are so bold

453
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
How dare you take Master Sheng Xuan

454
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
Release him

455
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
I'll let you three go

456
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
They are seven now

457
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Seven dogs

458
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
Master, is Master Sheng Xuan among them?

459
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Master Sheng Xuan is one of them

460
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I'm one of them

461
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
I'll kill you

462
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
But there is one

463
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Xiao Xiu is naughty again

464
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Get out of here

465
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Master Sheng Xuan, we are here to rescue you

466
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
I called you Sheng Xuan

467
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,480
How dare you say you have nothing to do with Qiyuan Sect

468
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
You are lying

469
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
You are the bad guy of Qiyuan Sect

470
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
Miss Yue

471
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Can you really tell right from wrong?

472
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,480
You brat, you have no eyes

473
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Put down the knife

474
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
If you let her go, I can spare you

475
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Otherwise, I'll let you know what is flying goose flying fire

476
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Kill yourself

477
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Kill yourself

478
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
We agreed to disappear

479
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Disappear

480
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
The king of medicine is also your king

481
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
You Qiyuan Sect caught so many people

482
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
What are you going to do?

483
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,480
You don't expect these disciples to save you

484
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Doctor Yan, why don't you talk?

485
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Seems to have something on your mind

486
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Let me guess

487
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Are you thinking

488
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Why haven't the poison of the star incense on these guys yet?

489
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,480
You sprinkled star incense on the flower, right?

490
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Look at this flower

491
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
This is the flower that Bian Long Huan just took

492
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Is there anything suspicious?

493
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I compared this flower and other flowers

494
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,480
This flower's pollen is obviously poisonous

495
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Bian Long Huan is good at using medicine

496
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Did he sprinkle these pollen?

497
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Should be

498
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
And there is no mosquito in this inn

499
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,480
He specifically told the shopkeeper to light the wild grass

500
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I'll take this boat to get some rest

501
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Let him find out what the poison is

502
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Can connect with the wild grass

503
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Let him bring the antidote

504
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Because this matter still needs to be announced to everyone

505
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
The combination of star incense and wild grass

506
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Will make the person who is hit by it in one day

507
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Once it is released, it will temporarily lose its power

508
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,480
It seems that I underestimated you

509
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
Okay, okay, okay, kid

510
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
Don't talk so much, okay?

511
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
You, you put the knife down, put it down

512
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,480
I will warn you one last time

513
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
If you don't release the Lord Shengxuan

514
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,480
I'll let you have no return

515
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Please

516
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Retreat, really retreat

517
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Retreat

518
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,480
The seed of the martial arts is not self-explanatory

519
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,480
Please, everyone

520
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
Leave our third brother

521
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Second sister, Yuan

522
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
You are waiting for them

523
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
So yesterday, Luo Xiong suddenly got sick

524
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
It's your birthday

525
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Just to delay time

526
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,480
The combination of star incense and wild grass

527
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Does it make the weak person sick?

528
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Thank you for your advice, Dr. Bian

529
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I will remember this chapter for Xiao Zhao Yan

530
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
I will remember this chapter for Xiao Zhao Yan

531
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,480
I will remember this chapter for Xiao Zhao Yan

532
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Let go of my third brother

533
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Yuan, don't forget your mission

534
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Got it

535
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
Xiao Zhao Yan, how can you be so strong?

536
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Be careful

537
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Xiao Zhao Yan, are you running?

538
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Senior, now is not the time to chat

539
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
We are also living and dying

540
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I will kill you

541
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
I will kill you

542
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Xiao Huan, let's go

543
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Xiao Huan

544
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Go

545
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Xiao Huan

546
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Bai Zi Lan

547
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Senior

548
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Don't be so strong

549
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
You can't beat him

550
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
You have to fight

551
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Xiao Zhao Yan

552
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
I am a demon

553
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Xiao Zhao Yan

554
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
Senior

555
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Go

556
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Jin Zhao

557
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Senior

558
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
Senior

559
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Senior

560
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Senior

561
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Senior

562
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Senior

563
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Senior

564
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Senior

565
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Senior

566
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Senior

567
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Senior

568
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
Senior

569
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Senior

570
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Senior

571
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Senior

572
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Senior

573
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Senior

574
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
