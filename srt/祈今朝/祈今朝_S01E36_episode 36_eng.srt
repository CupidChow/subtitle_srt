1
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:24,920


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,424
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,852
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,328
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,432
   

19
00:01:56,432 --> 00:02:00,030
   

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,128
You... You have betrayed Her Lordship.

21
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,947
And the Yu Clan. Why have you come here?

22
00:02:09,947 --> 00:02:14,127
Do you intend to wipe out the entire Yu Clan?

23
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,180
I came to find Shuo Xuan.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,759
You aren't worthy of speaking her name.

25
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,868
I do not want to harm you.

26
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:29,087
You are not allowed to trespass the Sea of Clear Skies.

27
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,747
Young Lord.

28
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,928
Young Lord, please follow me.

29
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,308
What is going on?

30
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:14,388
Shuo Xuan, you...

31
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:18,447
After Her Lordship's true form fell into a deep sleep,

32
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:22,907
Shuo Xuan used Meditation Spell to replace Kun's consciousness

33
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,928
and control her body.

34
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,548
 Yue Qi, you have finally come. 

35
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:28,868
 Yue Qi, you have finally come. 

36
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,667
Why do you want Rehai?

37
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,967
 Why? The reason lies above you. 

38
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:59,628
Many of our people were injured in this battle and are recuperating here.

39
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,208
I cannot make decisions regarding Rehai.

40
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,768
But I will consult with Zhaoyan.

41
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,827
You must not.

42
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:21,467
 Ying Xuwei, what are you here for? 

43
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,388
 This has nothing to do with you. 

44
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,648
You shall not lay your hands on Rehai.

45
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:29,068
 Then I will send Kun to the human world. 

46
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,188
Don't.

47
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:34,447
Shuo Xuan, let's just tell them...

48
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,667
the real reason.

49
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,887
Her Lordship's consciousness has fallen into slumber.

50
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:47,088
Kun's body instinctively needs energy to heal the wounds from the battle.

51
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:54,848
Repressing this instinct alone has already exhausted Shuo Xuan.

52
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:58,488
Without the power of Rehai,

53
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:01,408
eventually, she won't be able to hold on.

54
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:06,467
So you want the power of Rehai to cure Zhu Yu.

55
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,327
Rehai can only provide temporary relief.

56
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:15,888
If Kun cannot complete the transformation,

57
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:22,388
your Yu Clan, including Zhu Yu, must enter the time stasis.

58
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,687
 Ying Xuwei, 

59
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,648
 do you want to see a catastrophe in the human world again? 

60
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:32,447
I have an idea.

61
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,667
Let's hear it.

62
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,728
I possess the bloodline of Kun.

63
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:41,940
I can provide my spiritual power to Zhu Yu to calm her instincts.

64
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,807
In this way, it will not affect the human world.

65
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,048
Have you thought it through?

66
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,968
Zhu Yu has been sleeping for ten thousand years.

67
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:56,127
Providing her with your spiritual power could be fatal to you.

68
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,388
 At least you still have a conscience. 

69
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:01,887
But I have a condition.

70
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:06,307
The sleeping Yu Clan will enter the time stasis together with Zhu Yu.

71
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:09,767
The awakened Yu Clan may return to the sea.

72
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:13,027
 - Yue Qi, how dare you?  
 - Shuo Xuan.

73
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:18,220
To seize Rehai to treat the Yu Clan, we harmed innocent humans.

74
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,959
We cannot make the same mistake again.

75
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,794
Even if we lose,

76
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:29,087
our Yu Clan...

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,620
mustn't lose our dignity.

78
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,907
Young Lord.

79
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,148
Young Lord.

80
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,808
I'm counting on you.

81
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,940
I'm also responsible for the Yu Clan.

82
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:09,907
Shuo Xuan,

83
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,760
I didn't fulfill my duty as the daughter.

84
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,300
After this is settled,

85
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,767
you should take over as the Young Lord.

86
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:22,588
 Yue Qi, what do you mean? Apologizing to the Yu Clan? 

87
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,268
 Or did you realize they're your burden now? 

88
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,028
Shuo Xuan!

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,821
I am Zhu Yu's daughter,

90
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:33,960
but I've never lived among the Yu Clan.

91
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,781
Shuo Xuan understands and cares for them more than I do.

92
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:39,840
She is more suitable for the role.

93
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:46,268
Commander Ying, what do you think of it?

94
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,407
I agree.

95
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:03,527
Then, we must trouble you to open the Mist Soul afterward.

96
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,700
Young Lord!

97
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,967
Thank you.

98
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,427
Ying Xuwei.

99
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:26,807
I will follow Her Lordship into the time stasis.

100
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,407
Shuo Xuan.

101
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,167
Entering the time stasis...

102
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,467
equals eternal imprisonment.

103
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,347
You are young.

104
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,567
If we migrate to the sea,

105
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,807
we can start over again.

106
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,728
Her Lordship is our savior.

107
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,167
I should stay by her side.

108
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:06,527
I'm also doing you a favor by accompanying Her Lordship.

109
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,728
From now on, we are even.

110
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:17,540
I am willing to follow Her Lordship to the time stasis.

111
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:23,627
 I am willing to follow Her Lordship to the time stasis. 

112
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:25,128
You...

113
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,008
I knew it.

114
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:38,928
We Yu Clan are all fearless warriors.

115
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,700
Shuo Xuan.

116
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,221
Please take care of her.

117
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,027
She is also my mother.

118
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,047
Mother.

119
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:14,427
Xiaoyuan,

120
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:17,407
go back to rest.

121
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:16,808
Now, everything

122
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:19,368
is finally over.

123
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:24,928
At the grand ceremony, the drums will sound.

124
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:28,807
The flower will pass on. The dancer will be found.

125
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,967
Beautiful women will sing harmonious songs.

126
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:36,828
Spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums

127
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:39,587
shall never cease...

128
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,208
through the ages.

129
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:40,067
Second Sister, your left hand is about to rust.

130
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,348
Second Sister.

131
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:04,628
If you don't wake up, mushrooms will grow on you.

132
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:12,100
Second Sister, do you want to go and bask in the sun?

133
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,108
I'll take you out in a moment.

134
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:41,707
It's finally over.

135
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,228
Yes.

136
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:46,707
The Yu Clan has entered the time stasis.

137
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,888
And there are no disasters in the human world.

138
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,708
This is the best possible ending.

139
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:01,648
You have been greatly weakened. You must rest well.

140
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:09,207
We've arrived at the western wasteland.

141
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,128
Do you remember, Young Xiu?

142
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:24,587
This is where we met Zhaoyan and Young Yue.

143
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:30,888
Back then, they were all with us.

144
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,960
Everyone, thank you.

145
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,260
Let's part ways from here.

146
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,408
Miss Yue, where are you going?

147
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,887
Will you do something foolish?

148
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,928
Of course not.

149
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:16,908
People meet and part like duckweed. Don't force it.

150
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,468
Young Yue, take care.

151
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,239
Xian Qing.

152
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,719
Zhaoyan.

153
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,407
Sister Ming Xiu.

154
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,047
You take care as well.

155
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,748
You too.

156
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,008
And you?

157
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,647
I...

158
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,627
I want to seek the art of eternal life.

159
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:53,527
Maiming borrowed my life before.

160
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:56,067
Although the curse has been lifted,

161
00:18:56,067 --> 00:19:00,088
the lifespan he took from me has not been returned.

162
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:03,708
The time I have left is not much.

163
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,687
If I were to die like this,

164
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,508
even if fate allows us to meet again,

165
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:15,188
I certainly would not remember the time I had with you.

166
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,660
I will not accept that.

167
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:24,027
I will go with you.

168
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,167
And you, Young Xiu?

169
00:19:41,128 --> 00:19:46,007
I'll return to Mount Yuqing. You can have the Yunlai Stone.

170
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,588
Young Xiu, take care of yourself.

171
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,808
You should take care of yourself as well.

172
00:19:58,808 --> 00:20:00,608
Miss Ming, take care.

173
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,027
Goodbye.

174
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,868
If we miss Miss Ming,

175
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:24,428
we can go see her at Mount Yuqing.

176
00:20:25,347 --> 00:20:27,447
But Miss Yue...

177
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,367
We'll meet again if fate allows.

178
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:40,400
We have witnessed how much Miss Yue has grown.

179
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,300
I believe she will follow her heart.

180
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,199
♫  A preface to the sorrowful wind. Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

181
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:27,225
♫  Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

182
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:32,615
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

183
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:38,120
♫  Instead why not take my doomed fate away  ♫

184
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,910
♫  The mirror reflects the shadows but remains invisible  ♫

185
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:50,599
♫  Like those hidden emotions, icy and piercing  ♫

186
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,755
♫  Using the lightest words  ♫

187
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,983
♫  To make the harshest decisions  ♫

188
00:21:54,983 --> 00:22:02,727
♫  No different from a death sentence  ♫

189
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:09,877
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

190
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:15,500
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

191
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,039
Master,

192
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:19,883
I'm back.

193
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,020
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

194
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,580
During this time,

195
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,830
I've experienced a lot.

196
00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:33,083
And I finally understood

197
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:38,011
why you had given up your life for the lives of others.

198
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:44,744
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

199
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:48,504
Now, I think...

200
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:52,444
I've made the same decision as you.

201
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:57,164
Right.

202
00:22:57,164 --> 00:22:59,044
As for Xian Qing.

203
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,944
This thousand-year-old wolf demon had no desires before.

204
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:06,624
But now, he also has someone he cares for.

205
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:09,144
That he could end up with Zhaoyan,

206
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:16,203
I think, is also a gift granted to him by the endless time.

207
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,843
Master,

208
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:37,263
your Xiu'er has grown up.

209
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:43,023
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

210
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:48,718
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

211
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:53,959
♫  What was thought to be evergreen withers between my fingers  ♫

212
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:59,854
♫  Even the embraces feel forced  ♫

213
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:05,551
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

214
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:10,804
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

215
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:13,583
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

216
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:17,681
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

217
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:23,023
♫  Humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

218
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:30,404
♫  In the dream  ♫

219
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:36,712
♫  humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

220
00:24:39,984 --> 00:24:42,463
I'm an old person.

221
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:44,923
I will need you to take care of me.

222
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,003
Okay.

223
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:50,583
How is your health?

224
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,984
Fine.

225
00:24:51,984 --> 00:24:55,163
I quite enjoy having you take care of me.

226
00:24:57,683 --> 00:25:00,923
We should be near the place in the legend now.

227
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:23,443
This art of eternity truly left no trace.

228
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:26,944
We've been searching for days, but without success.

229
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,683
I'm afraid we've started this journey in vain.

230
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:35,344
The world is vast. We will find it eventually.

231
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,384
But I don't want it anymore.

232
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:46,463
Since it cannot be found,

233
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:50,183
I will cultivate alongside you to seek immortality.

234
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,044
How about it?

235
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:54,123
Are you sure about this?

236
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:02,123
Although this place is secluded,

237
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:04,263
there are countless creatures here.

238
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:08,323
These plants also seem especially lush.

239
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:10,603
Is this the nimbus you spoke of?

240
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,724
This is indeed a good place for recuperating.

241
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:17,964
Good. Then let's cultivate here.

242
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:24,484
But I have no strength left now.

243
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:28,064
I'm afraid I'll need you to help me up.

244
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,663
You've lost all your strength.

245
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:41,684
I guess you can't help me with my hairpin anymore.

246
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:45,863
Of course I can.

247
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:51,624
But do you really understand the loyalty of the Wolf Tribe?

248
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:56,844
We've been through so much. It's about time, isn't it?

249
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:30,503
I am already aware of your intentions from the stream of memories.

250
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,043
You wish to exchange the life of Yue Jinzhao?

251
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:34,523
Yes.

252
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,484
I want Jinzhao to come back.

253
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:41,523
If you have a wish, you must make a sacrifice.

254
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,603
You can only exchange for his life

255
00:28:43,603 --> 00:28:47,784
at the cost of your existence.

256
00:28:48,404 --> 00:28:49,884
Okay.

257
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:55,164
The so-called existence refers to all your memories

258
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:58,803
and the memories others have of you.

259
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,603
When your existence disappears,

260
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:03,563
no one in this world will remember you.

261
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,861
Okay.

262
00:29:07,603 --> 00:29:12,200
 Jinzhao, if one day, something happens to me, you must not exchange yourself for me. 

263
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,643
 Because I don't want to forget you at all. 

264
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,740
 Don't talk nonsense. 

265
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,861
All my memories...

266
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,084
are my time with Jinzhao.

267
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,203
With him gone,

268
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:32,203
my memory is meaningless.

269
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:38,890
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

270
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,240
 Jinzhao was smart... 

271
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,640
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

272
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,320
 ...and impressive. 

273
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,849
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

274
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,180
 He was good at everything. 

275
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,480
 He should live longer than merely four years. 

276
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:58,860
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

277
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,780
I beg you.

278
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,306
Bring him back.

279
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,480
 In this case, you already know the price. 

280
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,843
 The disaster Zhu Yu brought still lingers... 

281
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:23,003
 because I failed in my duty as the Mist Soul guardian. 

282
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:26,963
 I have failed the world, yet I am powerless to make amends. 

283
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:31,343
 I can only make it up to Yue Jinzhao and Qi. 

284
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:37,564
 Your life is already meager. 

285
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:42,543
 The life you exchange for is bound to be short. 

286
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:45,826
♫  The memories fall and swirl backwards  ♫

287
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:51,063
♫  Only following the heart, never asking if it's right or wrong  ♫

288
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:56,803
 If only there is someone else willing to exchange for Yue Jinzhao, 

289
00:30:56,803 --> 00:31:01,854
♫  Then now we could be intoxicated together  ♫

290
00:31:01,854 --> 00:31:05,144
♫  Facing life and death together, unafraid  ♫

291
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:07,124
 ...she will come. 

292
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,503
♫  No matter how hard it is to meet again  ♫

293
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:18,564
 Use all my life and what she's willing to pay to bring him back. 

294
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:21,343
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

295
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:26,044
Since you've decided, we will start.

296
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:33,854
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

297
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:37,240
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

298
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,904
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

299
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:49,700
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

300
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,501
Will Jinzhao...

301
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,080
♫  It's a miracle  ♫

302
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,560
...really forget me?

303
00:32:06,682 --> 00:32:17,045
♫  It's a miracle. Protecting you is the trace of my existence of love in this life  ♫

304
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:29,864
Second Sister, this dragonfly is quite pretty.

305
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:34,187
Strange.

306
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:40,507
I just can't remember who promised to make a hundred grass dragonflies for me.

307
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,961
Second Sister.

308
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:49,142
Wake up.

309
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:53,183
Come look for that person with me.

310
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,724
Second Sister. Wake up, please.

311
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:07,764
Eldest Sister.

312
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,961
Wake up.

313
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:19,423
 Strange. Why am I crying? 

314
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:21,004
Everyone.

315
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:26,060
Today, I'll tell you about the battle of Buried Wind Plains.

316
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,804
    
 In that battle,

317
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:37,603
to save the common folk, the Righteous Martial Alliance fought bravely to their demise.

318
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:38,784
Everyone.

319
00:34:38,784 --> 00:34:41,540
Do you know who is most worthy of mention?

320
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,464
 Who? 

321
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:51,084
The one most worthy of mention is the man who risked his own life to fight the evil,

322
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:52,964
Hall Leader Ju.

323
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,904
 Hall Leader Ju? 

324
00:34:55,904 --> 00:34:57,984
You don't know him?

325
00:34:57,984 --> 00:35:00,483
Let me tell you about him.

326
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,699
Boy.

327
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:11,063
Are you okay?

328
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,424
I'm fine.

329
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:16,483
I'm sorry, Miss. I bumped into you.

330
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:18,643
It's all right. Be careful in the future.

331
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:20,064
Don't get yourself hurt.

332
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,143
That's right.

333
00:35:21,143 --> 00:35:24,443
You are a brave young man. You need to learn to protect yourself.

334
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:27,784
Here, your toy.

335
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:30,163
Thank you, Brother.

336
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:39,023
Mister, have we met before?

337
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:40,784
I don't think so.

338
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:45,083
I see. Please excuse me.

339
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:13,884
Young Xiu.

340
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:20,523
After so many years, you're still as lively as ever, Senior Uncle.

341
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:23,403
It seems it's true that the bad ones always have a long life.

342
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:27,623
However, why did you ask to meet here?

343
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,543
It was my idea.

344
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:32,043
Back then, we used to boat under the moonlight here.

345
00:36:32,043 --> 00:36:35,818
But I have yet to see the daytime scenery.

474
00:44:01,786 --> 00:44:09,360
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫
