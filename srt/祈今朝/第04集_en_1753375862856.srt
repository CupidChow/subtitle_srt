1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,040
Such a nice iron tomb.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,520
Thank you for your help, Brother Luo.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,440
You're welcome.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
Where are Brother Yue and Xiao Yue?

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,960
They've set off to the village of Luo Ri.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,920
What?

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
Didn't we agree to set off together?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,800
I guess they're angry at me.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,840
Next,

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
we'll be the only ones to go.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,240
It's okay.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
We're going to the same place anyway.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,760
Maybe we'll meet each other halfway.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,280
We'll meet each other.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,800
I'll see you later.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Xing Zhao,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,880
didn't you say my birth history

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,000
is related to Jiuquan?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,200
Why didn't we stay at Luo's house

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,560
to ask them?

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,320
I was able to enter the Octa Tower yesterday.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm afraid Luo Man Min

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,800
purposely let me in.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,320
Even if you're related to Jiuquan,

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,000
he won't tell us.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Fortunately, there's a clue from the Chief,

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,440
so we can find out the birth history

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,720
by following him.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm tired.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
I want to take a carriage,

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,320
drink ice water,

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
and eat ice fruits.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Have a dream.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Let's go.

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,240
Brother Yue and Xiao Yue,

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
get in the car.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,440
Let's go.

40
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,320
My dream has come true.

41
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Xing Zhao,

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
I'll wait for you at Luo's Village

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
with Shi Fang and Zhao Yan.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Let's see who's faster.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,280
Brother Yue, get in the car.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,960
Well,

47
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,680
why is Jin Zhao

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
so cold today?

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,760
Did she wake up too early

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,120
to get up early today?

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,720
No.

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
Jin Zhao is so stubborn.

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
It's because of you.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm afraid you'll be sold

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
and have to count money.

56
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,160
Jin Zhao,

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,960
are you still mad at Zhao Yan?

58
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Jin Zhao,

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
if you're mad at him,

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,880
and you don't want to talk to him,

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,040
I won't talk to him either.

62
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
Just put that in your heart.

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,520
Don't say it out.

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
It's okay.

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm holding it with my hands.

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
They can't hear it.

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,280
Really?

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes.

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,960
Brother Luo, eat.

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
What are you looking at?

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
Just looking.

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
In the car,

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,040
they said they were with me.

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Now I see others eating something delicious,

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
I feel regretful.

76
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,880
I didn't know you were a little regretful.

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
But I don't regret being with you.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,680
Jin Zhao,

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,520
why did you quarrel with Zhao Yan?

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you still thirsty?

81
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
And the weather is so hot.

82
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,720
The sun is so big.

83
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,080
Brother Yue, Xiaoyue,

84
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
have some snacks.

85
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Thank you.

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Brother Jun,

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
let's go find Shuiyuan.

88
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Us two?

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
It's okay to take this.

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Here you are.

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Come on.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Let's go.

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
You're smart, Jin Zhao.

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
Zhao Yan,

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm so thirsty.

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
Do you have water?

97
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Thank you.

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll go get some water.

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Okay.

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
You seem to be thirsty

101
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
all the way here.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Jin Zhao always says

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
I'm like a fish

104
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
who can't get away from water.

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Brother Yue treats you well.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,040
You treat me well too.

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I...

108
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Are you going to kill me?

109
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Yes.

110
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
It's okay.

112
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
You don't have to apologize.

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Everyone has the right

114
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
to choose their own position.

115
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I didn't expect you to be so straightforward.

116
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Jin Zhao told me.

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Hit.

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Hit him hard.

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
It's your good fortune

120
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
to be liked by the Lord.

121
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
How dare you escape?

122
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Hit him.

123
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Hit him until he has no strength

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
to escape.

125
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Commander.

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
You...

127
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
You...

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
You...

129
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
You're so bold.

130
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
I'll kill you today.

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Lord, please protect me.

132
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Lord, please protect me.

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
I'm not the Lord.

134
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm Yue Qi.

135
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
You're afraid of revealing your identity.

136
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Lord, it's okay.

137
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Kill them all.

138
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
You won't reveal your whereabouts.

139
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I'll kill you if I have to.

140
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Captain.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
You're so bold.

142
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
You're so bold.

143
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Captain.

144
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
You're really not Ming Chu.

145
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Otherwise,

146
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
why would you

147
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
fight against us

148
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
in a fight?

149
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Kill them.

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
You...

151
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
You're so sincere

152
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
and righteous.

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Yue Qiang.

154
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Do I look like a hero?

155
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Yes.

156
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
It's good now.

157
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Okay, hero.

158
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
We should find Shui Yuan.

159
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
Don't die here

160
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
before you become a hero.

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Yue Qiang.

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
What did you call me?

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Hero.

164
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Hero.

165
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
I'm a hero.

166
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Yue Qiang.

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You're now a hero.

168
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
You're a hero.

169
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Come on.

170
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Yue Qiang.

171
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,140
Monster plane

172
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,900
Brother Yan

173
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
Brother Yan

174
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,100
Brother Yan

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,020
Look at that.

176
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,420
You don't look like an inward-looking woman.

177
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,340
What's wrong?

178
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,100
I don't know

179
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,660
what kind of feeling it is.

180
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm getting flustered.

181
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,820
You're worried about Miss Xiaoyue?

182
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,300
Yes,

183
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,900
she is frail

184
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,940
and gravity-inflexible

185
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,500
and adorable.

186
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,160
He surely doesn't know anything about making weapons.

187
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,740
Probably talking about it too.

188
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,120
I actually have my hair scratch just now.

189
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,580
I'd like to leave.

190
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,280
Then I can't make it anymore.

191
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,620
Okay, then.

192
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay?

193
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,020
Please don't worry too much.

194
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,960
Just to you.

195
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,100
It's nothing to be anxious about.

196
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,280
But Chief Luo is quite stable.

197
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,180
You can be more rest assured.

198
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,940
Really?

199
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,680
I can only make my stir-fry for you

200
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,100
When you lose,

201
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,720
I'll have to kill you

202
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,580
That sounds so easy

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Just do us a favor

204
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
Is it okay?

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,380
Yes

206
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,600
Ya CBS

207
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,760
Go

208
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,460
Go

209
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,480
behalf

210
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,320
What should I do?

211
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,980
Nothing

212
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,060
Just do me a favor

213
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,300
Your worst impression

214
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,740
Because there is a só ruo

215
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,380
Exactly

216
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Are you okay?

217
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,980
Shi Fang, keep an eye on that person.

218
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,380
Luo Xiong, let's go together.

219
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
Okay.

220
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Go!

221
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
How is it?

222
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
Jinzhao, I want to try the Spirit-gathering Skill.

223
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,380
No, I just got hurt.

224
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Jinzhao, I want to protect everyone too.

225
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,380
I want to protect everyone too.

226
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Jinzhao, I want to protect everyone too.

227
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
I can't hold on anymore.

228
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

229
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,380
You guys hurry and find a chance to leave.

230
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
No!

231
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
Kill together if you want to.

232
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
Run away together if you want to.

233
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
I won't leave you alone.

234
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Jinzhao, you're not going to die.

235
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

236
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

237
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

238
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

239
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

240
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

241
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

242
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

243
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

244
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

245
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

246
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

247
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
I'll go and get the Spirit-gathering Skill.

248
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
You're so good.

249
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
Thank you for your help.

250
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Thank you. Thank you.

251
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Okay.

252
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
It still hurts.

253
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
It'll be better in a while.

254
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
This medicine is very good.

255
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,380
This medicine is very precious. I usually don't give it to you.

256
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Jin Zhao,

257
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
are you reconciled with Zhao Yan?

258
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
You're so smart.

259
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
Thank you, Yue.

260
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,380
Please give me your name.

261
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
This is the handsome, cool,

262
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
powerful, and brave,

263
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
and unrivaled Brother Luo Luo.

264
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
Luo Zhao Yan.

265
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
This heart

266
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,380
will never leave you.

267
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
This is the famous

268
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
Master of the Skill Hall of the Zhenwu Alliance,

269
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Ju Shi Fang, Ju Da Xiang.

270
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
My name is Yue Qi.

271
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
My favorite egg noodles.

272
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,380
Yue Qi.

273
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
You're so smart.

274
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
This is Yue Jin Zhao.

275
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
That is Yue Qi.

276
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
Your name?

277
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,380
My new name is just a name.

278
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
You're like a show.

279
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Just call me Xian Qing.

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Ju Shi Fang.

281
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Zhao Yan.

282
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Jin Zhao.

283
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
Qi.

284
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Don't call me Qi.

285
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
It's not good to call me Qi.

286
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Call me Yue.

287
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Yue.

288
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
But this place is remote.

289
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Why do you and Miss Ming come here?

290
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,380
Xiao Xiu is a disciple of Yu Qing Shan.

291
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,380
I was entrusted by her

292
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,380
to accompany her to the mountain.

293
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,380
I heard that

294
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,380
she is the most

295
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
hidden sect in the martial arts world.

296
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,380
She rarely sees

297
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Yu Qing Shan's disciples.

298
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380
I know the news.

299
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380
Yu Qing Shan is really

300
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
a good person.

301
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
Yes.

302
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
We only have

303
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
two people and one dog.

304
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
In the two people,

305
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
that dog is really

306
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,380
a bit too much.

307
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380
By the way,

308
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,380
why are you here?

309
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,380
She is the reason we came here.

310
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,380
How is it? Does your wound still hurt?

311
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,380
It doesn't hurt anymore.

312
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,380
It's just...

313
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Jin Zhao,

314
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
in the past, I only wanted to protect you.

315
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
But just now,

316
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
when I saw Zhao Yan and the others

317
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,380
in danger, I also wanted to protect them.

318
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
It's your first time protecting others.

319
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
How do you feel

320
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,380
when you fight with them?

321
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
I feel hot here.

322
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Let's go.

323
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,380
Let's go see how Miss Ming

324
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,380
is doing.

325
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Sir.

326
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
You scared me.

327
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Let's go.

328
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
Go.

329
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380
I really want to send you to the road.

330
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
It's not easy to get back

331
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
your life.

332
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
I'm done. I'm going to lose it again.

333
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Minister Si Zhao,

334
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
didn't we already let people

335
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
send the rest of their lives to Lu Ru Village?

336
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Just lose one.

337
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,380
It's all your fault. You're lazy,

338
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
then...

339
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Let's go back and fight back.

340
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Fight back?

341
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
How?

342
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,380
You try it.

343
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
It's okay.

344
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Minister Sheng Xuan said

345
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,380
he'll take care of Lu Ru Village.

346
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,380
Let's retreat for now.

347
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
Let's rest.

348
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Life is like a play.

349
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
We can start over.

350
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,380
You're so good.

351
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Are you sure

352
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
he was seduced by the Qiyuan Sect?

353
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
That's right.

354
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
We came here to investigate this.

355
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Lu Ru Village

356
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
must have the Qiyuan Sect's location.

357
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
I see.

358
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
Then I'll talk to Xiao Xiu

359
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
about the death of the Qiyuan Sect.

360
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
We'll take care of it before we leave.

361
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,380
Thank you for your help.

362
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
Qi and I will go to the front

363
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,380
to check the situation.

364
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Please take care of that person.

365
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Thank you for your help.

366
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I heard

367
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
there's a friend called Bian Luo Huan in Lu Ru Village.

368
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
He's very good at medicine.

369
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
I've taken care of him,

370
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
but you need to send him there as soon as possible.

371
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,380
So,

372
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
instead of being scared of being attacked by the enemy,

373
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,380
you'd better be careful.

374
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Uncle,

375
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
where's Dr. Bian?

376
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,380
Dr. Bian?

377
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Dr. Bian is on the grass.

378
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Over there.

379
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,380
Qi.

380
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,380
Where's Senior Xian Jin?

381
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
He went to pick up the stones

382
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
after he ate too much.

383
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,380
He's not here.

384
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
He's not here.

385
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
He's not here.

386
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,380
He's not here.

387
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,380
He went to pick up the stones after he ate too much.

388
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,380
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,380
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,380
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,380
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,380
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
I'm sorry.

403
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
That kind of person

404
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,380
keeps bothering me.

405
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
funnily

406
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,380
It's really rare for him to have such a smoothing.

407
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
It's really rare for him to have such a smoothing.

408
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
I'm sorry.

409
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
I'm so sorry.

410
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
I'm sorry.

411
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
What are you doingangle?

412
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
I'm so sorry.

414
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
I'm sorry.

415
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
try to control your sun pepper.

416
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,380
Who can see it clearly?

417
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:27,380
It's destined that I'll fight for you

418
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Even if the ending is hard to escape

419
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:44,380
I will exchange a piece of my life for a little bit of my life

420
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,880
Leave to love the unspoken

421
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,380
I am Bian Luohuan

422
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,380
I am Yue Qi

423
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,380
Come in

424
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,380
Jin Zhao, you are too slow

425
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,380
You are too fast

426
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
This is the Dr. Bian we are looking for

427
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:33,380
Dr. Bian, this injured person has been poisoned by the demon

428
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,380
Please cure him

429
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Please put the injured person on the bed

430
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
The wound on the skin is very good

431
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,380
But the internal poison will take a lot of effort

432
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
You can handle it

433
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
I'll take the poison later

434
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,380
No big deal

435
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,380
But he lost too much blood

436
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,380
He needs to sleep for a while

437
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,380
Thank you, Dr. Bian

438
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
I will not take less blood

439
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,380
How did he get hurt?

440
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
We traveled here

441
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,380
We found this person who was sent by Qi Yuan

442
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
We helped each other

443
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
But he was poisoned and fainted

444
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,380
We came to the village to find you to cure

445
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
I see

446
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,380
Jin Zhao, is there a water pot here?

447
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,380
I'm thirsty

448
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Hold on a second

449
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
I'll take you to find water later

450
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
I was not considerate

451
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
I'll make tea for everyone

452
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
So magical

453
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
Why is Xiao Yue's cup different from ours?

454
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,380
Dr. Bian, we are thirsty too

455
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,380
This water is so sweet

456
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,380
Dr. Bian, we are going to find a place to stay in the village

457
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
I'll leave this person to you

458
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,380
I'm sorry, Dr. Bian

459
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
I was hurt too

460
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
I may need to rest here

461
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Please

462
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,380
Let's go

463
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Dr. Bian, did we know each other before?

464
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Maybe

465
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
I'm too noisy

466
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
I don't want to be seen as a stranger

467
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Qi Yuan, this is rude

468
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Let's go

469
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,380
What's going on between you and Dr. Bian?

470
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
What do you mean?

471
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,380
Have you seen him before?

472
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
I saw him when you saw me

473
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
I've never seen him before

474
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,380
Let's go

475
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Let's go for a walk

476
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
I'll stay with Zhao Yan

477
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
You stay with him?

478
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
I'll stay with him

479
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Why?

480
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
Because I want to talk to him

481
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,380
I want to talk to him

482
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,380
I want to talk to him

483
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Are you staying with him or...

484
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
I'm really angry with you

485
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Forget it

486
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Take care

487
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Why don't I know that

488
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
your uncle who is usually lazy

489
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
is willing to be close to humans?

490
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,380
Xiao Xiu

491
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
Luo Zhao Yan

492
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
has half of my power

493
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
Uncle has so much cultivation

494
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,380
Is it strange that he has half of your power?

495
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Xiao Xiu understands me so well

496
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
Uncle is very happy

497
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm so happy

498
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380
I'm so happy

499
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
I'm so happy

500
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,380
I'm so happy

501
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,380
I'm so happy

502
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,380
Uncle is very happy

503
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Is he the child from twenty years ago?

504
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Help

505
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,380
Help

506
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
Help

507
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Help

508
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,380
Help

509
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
Help

510
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
Humans

511
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
This is the place of demons

512
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Not the place you brought

513
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
You are a demon

514
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
Then you have the power of demons

515
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Please

516
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Please

517
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Give me your demon bullet

518
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,380
Let me save my daughter

519
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Please

520
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Please

521
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Please

522
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
But back then

523
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
He clearly said that he was training for his daughter

524
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
Shi Fang

525
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
Where is Xiao Yue?

526
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
He went to see Luo Xiong and Shang Huan

527
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
This great god

528
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
We passed by here

529
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Is there any empty room in the village?

530
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Brother Yue

531
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
We

532
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
If you ask like this

533
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Can it really wake up the spirit?

534
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,380
The moment our master entered the village

535
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
The spirit was already alerted

536
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
The village was in a mess

537
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
We can only rest in peace

538
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,380
If there is no news at all

539
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380
Then we have to be prepared

540
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Brother Yue is really a man of many skills

541
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
But brother Yue

542
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
This Dr. Bian

543
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
I don't know if it's good or bad

544
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Then Luo Xiong is injured

545
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
Is Xiao Yue in danger?

546
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
Don't worry

547
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,380
You can't beat a wounded Luo Zhao Yan

548
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,380
Ten injured Luo Zhao Yan

549
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Can't beat a full-fledged chess

550
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
I also want to be like Xiao Yue

551
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
What? What did you say?

552
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I didn't hear clearly

553
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,380
I said I also want to be like Xiao Yue

554
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
Little sister

555
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
Su noodles

556
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Egg noodles

557
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
Boss, one bowl of egg noodles

558
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Okay, come right away

559
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Boss, can you take a picture?

560
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,380
You have no money

561
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
Go, go, go

562
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
If you don't eat, hurry up

563
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,380
Don't take it as my business

564
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Two bowls

565
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,380
Dr. Bian

566
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Come

567
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,380
Okay, come right away

568
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Dr. Bian, why are you here?

569
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,380
I pass by

570
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
The jade pendant on Miss Yue is very special

571
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,380
This is from Jinzhao

572
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
For me

573
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
You seem to like fish

574
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Yes

575
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,380
I like it so much that I can't bear to eat them

576
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
By the way

577
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,380
I also have a particularly favorite little fish hairpin

578
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,380
I have been wearing it for three years

579
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
You see

580
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
I like it so much

581
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
I also like fish

582
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,380
My family used to raise a little fish

583
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
We grew up together

584
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,380
What happened later?

585
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,380
Later

586
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
Later she was lost

587
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
Lost

588
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Did you find it?

589
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
I can't find it

590
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,380
Then you must be very sad

591
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Two bowls of noodles, enjoy

592
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,380
I'll give you the egg

593
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Thank you, Dr. Bian

594
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
You are so good at it

595
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
If it was Jinzhao

596
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
He would definitely take my egg

597
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,380
You are right

598
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
Jinzhao, give it back to me

599
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
No

600
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Give it back to me

601
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,380
I have patients to treat

602
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,380
Thank you, Dr. Bian

603
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
Dr. Bian, take care

604
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
Why is he not here?

605
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
I don't know

606
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,380
Maybe Dr. Bian is hungry

607
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
It's delicious

608
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Eat slowly

609
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
The hair is in your mouth

610
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
Then I will go to find Shifang

611
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
I won't go

612
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Dr. Bian gave me a lot of money

613
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,380
And gave me a lot of bowls

614
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
Ok

615
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Then you go back early after eating

616
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Luo Xuan and Shanhuang are still injured

617
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Don't worry

618
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
I will take good care of them

619
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,380
Ok, eat slowly

620
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Boss, one more bowl

621
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,380
I don't know what's in this village

622
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
It's a girl

623
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
It's Miss Luo Xuan

624
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,380
Shifang

625
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
How's the news?

626
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Just there

627
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
Go

628
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,380
Qiyuan Sect attacked people?

629
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
Yes

630
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
But thanks to Dr. Bian

631
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
The injured have been treated by Dr. Bian

632
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
We chased here all the way

633
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,380
Maybe it's related to the village of Luri

634
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Uncle

635
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Is there anything strange in this village?

636
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
I have to go back and ask

637
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,380
But there are so many people in our village

638
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
They are all here

639
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
It's unlikely that there are bad people

640
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Uncle, don't worry

641
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
We are here, don't be afraid

642
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
We just need to rest here for two days

643
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
We will leave after the patients get better

644
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Is there any free wool in this village?

645
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Yes

646
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,380
There are several woolen houses in the northwest of the village

647
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,380
I will take you there

648
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,380
The village head is back

649
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
Dad, did those two young men just now

650
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,380
say that Qiyuan Sect attacked and killed people?

651
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Yes, A'Zhuo

652
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
By the way

653
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
Everyone must be careful recently

654
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,380
There is only our village nearby

655
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Could it be that we have people from Qiyuan Sect?

656
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Impossible

657
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,380
How can our village have people from Qiyuan Sect?

658
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Yes

659
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,380
They said that the people attacked by Qiyuan Sect

660
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
were being treated in Dr. Bian's wool house

661
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
When he wakes up

662
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
We can ask him clearly

663
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,380
Yes, we must ask him clearly

664
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,380
When he wakes up

665
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Drink slowly

666
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
Come, eat something

667
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Are these for me?

668
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
Dr. Bian, you are so kind

669
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,380
Is Dr. Bian here?

670
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Yes

671
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,380
Miss Yue

672
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
We must be careful in everything

673
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
If you are out

674
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
You should

675
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
Help each other

676
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Share with each other

677
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Thank you

678
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Miss Yue

679
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
Thank you for helping me today

680
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
You are welcome

681
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Miss Yue

682
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I am sorry

683
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Why are you saying sorry?

684
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,380
I have always suspected that you are the master

685
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
Even though I said that you are not

686
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,380
But my suspicion has never been eliminated

687
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,380
I am not the master

688
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
Miss Yue is innocent and cute

689
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
When in danger

690
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
She will also help each other

691
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
I think we are friends

692
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Dr. Bian

693
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,380
Are those outsiders telling the truth?

694
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,380
You just give us a proof

695
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
We are so scared

696
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Yes, Dr. Bian

697
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
Just give us a proof

698
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,380
The patients are still waiting in the room

699
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,380
It's not a good idea to wait outside

700
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,380
Why don't you go home and wait for the patients to wake up

701
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
Your questions will be answered

702
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,380
Village head

703
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
Yes

704
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
Dr. Bian

705
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,380
We are waiting for the patients to wake up

706
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,380
Let's go first

707
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,380
Let's go

708
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Let's go, Dr. Bian

709
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Since Zhao Yan is a friend

710
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,380
I want to tell you something

711
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Ok, but it doesn't matter

712
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
I think

713
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,380
Dr. Bian

714
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,380
I feel very close to him at first sight

715
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Like Jin Zhao

716
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
Dr. Bian

717
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
I think I know him

718
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
I think I know him

719
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
I think I know him

720
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
I think I know him

721
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
I think I know him

722
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
I think I know him

723
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
I think I know him

724
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
I think I know him

725
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
I think I know him

726
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
I think I know him

727
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
I think I know him

728
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
I think I know him

729
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
I think I know him

730
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I think I know him

731
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
I think I know him

732
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,380
I think I know him

733
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
I think I know him

734
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,380
I think I know him

735
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
I think I know him

736
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
I think I know him

737
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,380
I think I know him

738
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,380
I think I know him

739
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
I think I know him

740
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
I think I know him

741
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,380
I think I know him

742
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
I think I know him

743
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
I think I know him

744
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,380
I think I know him
