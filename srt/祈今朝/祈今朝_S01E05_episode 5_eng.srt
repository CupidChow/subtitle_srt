2
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,636
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,732
 ♫ If I decide to let my guard down ♫ 

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,424
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,732
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,852
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,328
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,384
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,376
   

19
00:01:56,376 --> 00:02:00,028
   

20
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,800
Jinzhao told me there should be no secrets between friends.

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,560
Since we are friends now, I want to tell you something.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,319
Okay, feel free to speak.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,419
Since I first saw Physician Bian, I felt like he was familiar.

24
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,460
 He feels like Jinzhao. 

25
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,079
Physician Bian resembles Brother Yue?

26
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,519
Yes... but not exactly.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,776
Just like...

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,360
Just like the difference between a vegetable bun and a meat bun.

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,720
Although they're both buns, the fillings are different.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,839
Brother Yue is unruly and perceptive, while Physician Bian...

31
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,959
Anyway, in my opinion, they're completely different.

32
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,679
Maybe you've seen Physician Bian before?

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,559
I don't think so.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,099
Miss Yue, have you ever heard of Rehai before?

35
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,400
 The matter of Rehai is confidential. Don't tell anyone. 

36
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:37,360
Then, Miss Yue, is there anything special about you?

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,799
I'm especially smart and clever, does that count?

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
Anything else?

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,959
Then, no.

40
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,319
Trust among friends. This is the last time I'll ask.

41
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,800
But I have one more favor to ask.

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,999
Can you not tell anyone that I asked you those questions?

43
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,760
Why?

44
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,239
This is important to me.

45
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,340
So please keep it a secret and don't tell anyone else.

46
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,899
All right, I promise you.

47
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:13,559
Zhaoyan, you've been good to us. As long as Jinzhao doesn't ask, I won't tell him.

48
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:20,440
But even if Brother Yue asks, don't tell him. Is that okay?

49
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,279
No way. If Jinzhao asks me, I'll definitely tell him.

50
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,819
- Well... 
 - Sorry.

51
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:33,620
The villagers had some medical questions and I was delayed.

52
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,720
Is there anything wrong with the patient?

53
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,800
No.

54
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,299
Zhaoyan, what's wrong with you?

55
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,199
Let me check.

56
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,739
Don't bother, Physician Bian. It's just an old illness.

57
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,199
Master Luo doesn't trust my medical skills?

58
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
Zhaoyan, you should let Physician Bian check you.

59
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,160
Then please, Physician Bian.

60
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,960
You seem to be in a condition I've never seen before.

61
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,999
It's okay. I just need to rest for a while. Thank you.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,520
I'm fine.

63
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,939
 There are no physical abnormalities, 

64
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,720
 yet the life force is flowing out of the body. 

65
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,300
 Is it the curse of the Twilight Luo family's twins dying young? 

66
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,720
No more nagging from now on.

67
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm telling you. You all heard it.

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,380
Physician Bian said everything would be clear when that patient wakes up.

69
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,099
Don't be so timid all the time.

70
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,099
Even if you don't trust him, you have to trust me. Right?

71
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,459
Even if you don't trust him, you have to trust me. Right?

72
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,620
Besides, with me here, there's nothing to worry about.

73
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,240
Everything's ready. We just need to wait for the fish to bite.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
Jinzhao, will this really work?

75
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,299
Of course. The wounded man attracted their attention already.

76
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:16,719
To cover up the crime, they'll take action.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,639
Miss Ming. Senior Xian Qing.

78
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,000
You're done with your stroll?

79
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,400
Yes. I'm getting old. It helps with digestion.

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,039
We've already found a place to stay. Let's pick up Brother Luo and Qi.

81
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,140
Look! I drew a map of the whole village.

82
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,030
What's... this?

83
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,939
The triangles represent houses.

84
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,759
The circles represent caves.

85
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
So where are we now?

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
This is our current location.

87
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,360
This is Physician Bian's house. Right?

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,159
Yes, correct.

89
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:03,719
Shifang, your map is really easy to understand.

90
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,140
Okay, then we'll hide near Bian Luohuan's house.

91
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,520
Wait for them to take action, and then we can surround them.

92
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,360
Brother Yue, I wouldn't recommend catching them in the village.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,680
It's dangerous. I'm afraid villagers might get hurt, that would be bad.

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Then let's drive them to Linyang Road.

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,459
Brother Luo, Shifang, and Senior Xian Qing, you'll be waiting for the prey there.

96
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,580
Qi, me, and Miss Ming, we'll keep watch near Bian Luohuan's house.

97
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,680
Okay.

98
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,560
I'll stay to protect Physician Bian.

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
No way.

100
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,719
Well, I mean...

101
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,199
Are you sure?

102
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,960
Yeah.

103
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,539
Jinzhao, you don't seem to want me to stay and protect Physician Bian.

104
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:00,700
Not at all. I just wonder if you can do it or not.

105
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,360
If I can't, can you?

106
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,879
Since it's all set up, let's go back and get some rest.

107
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,240
Okay.

108
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,332
 Physician Bian, have we met before? 

109
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,199
 Perhaps. 

110
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:09,180
Thinking about Qi is enough,

111
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,240
but why is this Bian Luohuan getting into my head, too?

112
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,360
It's really weird.

113
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
Jinzhao, do you have water?

114
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm in a medicated bath.

115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,599
Close your eyes!

116
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,300
Then, why didn't you shut the door?

117
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,560
Then, why didn't you knock?

118
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,759
Don't open your eyes.

119
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,792
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

120
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:10,039
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

121
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,159
Are you thirsty, too?

122
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:18,240
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

123
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,960
Qi, go outside first.

124
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,460
Why? You're dressed, aren't you?

125
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,599
Do you have any water? I'm really thirsty.

126
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,839
Knock on the door before you enter someone's room.

127
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,159
You aren't just someone.

128
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,572
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

129
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:43,204
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

130
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:45,079
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

131
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,240
Jinzhao, you're like a young lady like this.

132
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,299
Really.

133
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,939
You're exactly like those young ladies I read in storybooks when they've been seen bathing.

134
00:10:56,939 --> 00:11:02,359
When they are seen, they are either outraged or embarrassed.

135
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,076
Look! Look! Embarrassed, right?

136
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:10,479
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

137
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:12,000
Jinzhao!

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,088
You got me wet. I'm not playing with you anymore.

139
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,156
♫  Among the vast sea of people, I engrave your name  ♫

140
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:19,368
♫  Among the vast sea of people, I engrave your name  ♫

141
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:26,768
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

142
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,140
Qi.

143
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,970
Would you wipe someone else's head like this?

144
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,184
No.

145
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,859
Why?

146
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,000
Because Zhaoyan has a younger sister,

147
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,680
Shifang has Dou Bao,

148
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,079
and Ming Xiu has Xian Qing.

149
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,700
It's a pity, you have no one else, so there's only me.

150
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,480
I'm not pitiful at all.

151
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,980
I still have myself.

152
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,399
What a young lady.

153
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,000
Shut up.

154
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,380
Here's the water. Drink up.

155
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,120
Feels so nice.

156
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,340
Here.

157
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,159
Qi, why do you love drinking water so much?

158
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,599
Jinzhao, can you weave a straw butterfly?

159
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:38,399
No. Why do you ask?

160
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,599
In Physician Bian's cottage, there are many beautiful woven straw butterflies.

161
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,939
I want one, too.

162
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,760
What man would like things that only girls make?

163
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,239
Then I'll ask Physician Bian for one.

164
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,939
Since when did you get so close to Physician Bian?

165
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:01,560
Didn't I tell you many times not to talk to strangers?

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,519
I've always been close to him.

167
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,700
I think Physician Bian feels very much like how you make me feel.

168
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,519
So I find him approachable.

169
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,116
Jinzhao, what's the matter?

170
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,880
Nothing.

171
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,460
By the way, when you were guarding Physician Bian's house,

172
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,760
did you notice anything weird?

173
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,739
Do you mean Physician Bian or Zhaoyan?

174
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,399
Physician Bian.

175
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,610
What about Zhaoyan?

176
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,360
- Yes. 
 - What is it?

177
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,479
He apologized to me. He said, "We're friends from now on."

178
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,360
Then he's quite clever, much better than his younger sister.

179
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,079
He also asked me if I knew about Rehai.

180
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,160
Rehai?

181
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:00,552
   

182
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,179
How did you answer?

183
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,159
You told me to keep it a secret,

184
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:08,360
so I said I didn't know.

185
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,159
However, Zhaoyan also told me to keep it a secret.

186
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,300
Zhaoyan asked you to keep it a secret. Why did you tell me then?

187
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,079
I promised him I wouldn't tell you if you didn't ask.

188
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:24,240
But since you've asked, I can't lie to you.

189
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
Good.

190
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,079
Here, have some water.

191
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,039
Young Zhaoyan, are you enjoying the beautiful scenery?

192
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,560
Senior.

193
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,640
Not really.

194
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,440
So you're concerned about tonight's operation.

195
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,579
We have limited manpower.

196
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,599
If tonight's operation fails,

197
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:01,959
Physician Bian and that patient might both be in danger.

198
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,240
Didn't you agree to the plan to lure the snake out?

199
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,680
If it's something you decided on, and you hesitate partway...

200
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,200
Young Zhaoyan, this is what a hypocrite would do.

201
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,000
What you said is very similar to what one of my family members said.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,079
Perhaps, like he said, I really am a hypocrite.

203
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,550
It's been a long time since I've seen someone so innocent.

204
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,341
You're funny and adorable.

205
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,440
A-Adorable?

206
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:50,819
Senior, adorable isn't a word to describe me.

207
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,680
Today, we must not lose against Qiyuan Sect!

208
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,479
Of course not!

209
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's go!

210
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,839
 Brother Luo, I'm going to need you to wait with me tonight. 

211
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:51,280
 Miss Ming, Senior, and Shifang, you three ambush at Linyang Road. 

212
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,410
 After Brother Luo and I lure them over, you can come out to fight. 

213
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,580
 Qi, you keep an eye on Bian Luohuan and come to us if you get a chance. 

214
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,839
 If you encounter a strong opponent on the way, don't try to be brave. 

215
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,919
 Run if you can't win. 

216
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,039
We've been waiting a long time for you.

217
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,839
Surround them!

218
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,710
It's a trap! Retreat!

219
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,680
Qi!

220
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,424
I'll protect this place.

221
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,680
 Why am I suddenly so sleepy? 

222
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,208
 Why can't I open my eyes? 

223
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,479
Stinky Jinzhao... stealing my eggs again.

224
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,520
There's demons.

225
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,679
How dare you run wild here!

226
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,599
Miss Ming, no!

227
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,990
Hall Leader Ju, you know this demon? Why are you helping her?

228
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,799
Miss Shuo Xuan is a demon?

229
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,679
Come on, keep running.

230
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,199
Where's Shifang?

231
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,499
Young Shifang was captured by a demon.

232
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,080
I'll go take a look.

233
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,920
Wait!

234
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:08,400
Miss Shuo Xuan,

235
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,339
are you... a good demon or a bad one?

236
00:20:12,339 --> 00:20:14,719
Garbage doesn't deserve to know.

237
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,619
I'm not garbage.

238
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,079
I just don't want to fight you.

239
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:27,900
Miss Shuo Xuan, do you want to kill me?

240
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,020
Killing an ant isn't something I need to do personally.

241
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,920
D-Do you really have something to do with the Qiyuan Sect?

242
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,280
Qiyuan Sect is just a small sect. I really don't care.

243
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,280
You've been tricked into harming innocent people by the Qiyuan Sect.

244
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,199
Drop your weapons and tell us who's behind it, so you can make amends.

245
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,880
Harming innocent people?

246
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,140
How dare you ruin the reputation of the Qiyuan Sect!

247
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,420
Stubborn.

248
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,760
Brothers, attack!

249
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,099
It's you!

250
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,320
Miss Shuo Xuan,

251
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,199
if one day, you and I become enemies,

252
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:32,059
I-I'll definitely beat you and lead you onto the right path.

253
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,559
You really are such a dreamer.

254
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,719
Just with those shoddy gadgets? Against me?

255
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,099
Are you worthy?

256
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:46,719
One more thing,

257
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,920
what's the right path?

258
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,280
You and I aren't of the same kind.

259
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,839
From now on,

260
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,199
stay away from me.

261
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,360
 Shifang! 

262
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,640
How are you? Are you okay?

263
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm okay. Miss Shuo Xuan didn't hurt me.

264
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Shuo Xuan?

265
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,679
She's a demon?

266
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,759
She has already left.

267
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,479
Last time, she paid particular attention to Qi.

268
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,040
Now it's her again.

269
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,079
Next time I see her, I have to ask her.

270
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,499
Come... let's go find Brother Luo.

271
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,439
Oh no. We've been exposed!

272
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,679
That person will kill us. Let's just be honest.

273
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,199
Leave him alive!

274
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,959
May Lord Ming bless us.

275
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,100
I'm responsible for keeping an eye on Qi and Yue Jinzhao, not you.

276
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,360
Do you think I want to do this?

277
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,159
You exposed yourself at Jincui Oasis,

278
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,610
it's already aroused Yue Jinzhao's suspicions.

279
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,360
If you interfere again,

280
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,519
I won't show you any mercy.

281
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,120
Why did I fall asleep?

282
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,779
Physician Bian.

283
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:35,140
Physician Bian, let me check.

284
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,000
Are you okay?

285
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,059
Good then.

286
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,740
What about him?

287
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,159
He'll wake up soon.

288
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,879
What about Jinzhao? Why aren't they back yet?

289
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,620
Are they in some kind of danger?

290
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,539
As expected, he can't do it without my protection.

291
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,759
What an idiot.

292
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,120
 Pathetic. 

293
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,279
 Why is someone dead? 

294
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,240
 What happened? 

295
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,940
Jinzhao, are you okay?

296
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,979
How could I get injured so easily? Come on.

297
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,000
Zhuo'er. Zhuo'er.

298
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,280
Zhuo'er!

299
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,659
My son!

300
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,640
Shifang, you don't look so well. Have you been injured?

301
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,120
No.

302
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,390
I just saw... so many people die.

303
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,479
I just wanted to catch them,

304
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,459
but I didn't expect I would drive them to death.

305
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,280
I caused them to die.

306
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,360
Hall Leader Ju, as the head of the Righteous Martial Alliance, you should kill demons and evils.

307
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,599
Yet you fear this?

308
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,599
I'm not. But...

309
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,779
But they were all living beings.

310
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:07,279
It's you all who caused them to die!

311
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,579
 - It's them. Definitely them. 
 - Right, it must be them. 

312
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:13,020
 I knew it. It's them. 

313
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,119
 - It's them. 
 - It's them. 

314
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,240
You wicked people!

315
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,640
They had it coming. You dare blame us?

316
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Weren't you here to hurt us anyway?!

317
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,724
 - Exactly! 
 - They're here to hurt us! 

318
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,080
Sir, please hear me out.

319
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,900
We came here because we knew this might be the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

320
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,520
And the people who died were from the Qiyuan Sect.

321
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,619
So they deserved to die?!

322
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,679
No, we were trying to lure them out and capture them,

323
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,880
but unexpectedly, they all killed themselves.

324
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,379
Perhaps we should go check their houses together to look for any clues.

325
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:54,280
Brother Yue, there's no need to explain. This was caused by me.

326
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,020
It's my fault. I didn't stop them from killing themselves.

327
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,479
Everyone, I'm willing to bear all your grief and anger.

328
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:04,599
You'll bear it? You'll bear it?!

329
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,940
Can you bring them back to life?!

330
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,959
 Yeah, can you bring them back to life? 

331
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,559
 Can you bring them back to life? 

332
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,519
 - Right. 
 - He only knows how to talk! 

333
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,640
Young Zhaoyan, there's no need to talk to them anymore.

334
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,120
Everyone,

335
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:27,079
I suppose you're the heroes who saved me.

336
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,959
Why are you outside? Are you okay?

337
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,980
I'm much better now.

338
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,120
If you don't clarify the situation soon, the heroes will be in danger.

339
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,399
Everyone, listen to me. My name is Lang Mo.

340
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,499
I'm a businessman who came from Mangwan Village to Yinghui Fort.

341
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,039
People from the Qiyuan Sect knocked me out and then locked me up.

342
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:58,559
There were a lot of other people locked up with me.

343
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,680
It was them!

344
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,479
Impossible.

345
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,512
- Impossible... 
 - I wonder what happened to the others.

346
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:12,010
Heroes, please go save them.

347
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,559
Are you telling the truth?

348
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,620
I'll bet my life on it.

349
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,060
 It seems to be true. 

350
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,099
 - Yes. 
 - Really. 

351
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:24,320
 - It seems to be true.  
 - Fine.

352
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,920
So be it.

353
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,679
I'll let you... take a look at Zhuo'er's room.

354
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,160
Let's go.

355
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,240
 - Go, take a look. 
 - Let's take a look. 

356
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,760
 We'll know what's real and what's not then. 

357
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,959
 Just take a look. 

358
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,640
Are you okay?

359
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,679
Lang Mo, I'll take you to the cottage.

360
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,839
I can go back myself. Master Luo, you go ahead.

361
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,360
Oh my! There's a secret chamber.

362
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,839
Jinzhao, do you think there might be a Qiyuan Orb here too?

363
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,479
Young Xiu, what is this?

364
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,799
This is the enchanting herb. It can be refined into enchanting drug.

365
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,760
I remember we found this herb in Fujin Hall.

366
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,019
It seems that Qiyuan Sect's enchanting drug is made from this herb.

367
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:34,259
Although the scent is weak, Bian Luohuan's house does have this scent.

368
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,619
You mean...

369
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:41,679
Unless someone touched it, it's hard for the scent to stay on someone.

370
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,380
Also, I've never heard of such herbs growing in the Western Regions.

371
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,760
Qi, was there anything wrong with Bian Luohuan last night?

372
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,679
Last night, I fell asleep in Physician Bian's cottage.

373
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,320
So you wouldn't know what he did.

374
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:10,959
Do you think Bian Luohuan deliberately made Miss Yue fall asleep?

375
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,499
Young Yue, come up.

376
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,040
Young Yue has been in the cottage for too long.

377
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,161
There're dozens of scents on her. I can't tell the specific one.

378
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,640
Well... could it be we're overthinking it?

379
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,679
Maybe Young Yue was just too tired.

380
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,859
I don't think Physician Bian is a bad person.

381
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,840
He even helped us save Lang Mo.

382
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,080
Those disciples said something very interesting before they died.

383
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
"That person will kill us."

384
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:54,240
It means the one behind them is in Luori Village right now.

385
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,959
And Bian Luohuan is really suspicious.

386
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,679
We can never be too careful.

387
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,040
Just pretend we don't know anything, and observe some more.

388
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,599
Hurry, go get Physician Bian!

389
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,280
Quick!

390
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,280
Are they still alive?

391
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,599
Let's get them out of here first.

392
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,839
Let's split up. You all carry them out.

393
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,240
Qi, me, and Shifang will stay here to continue searching.

394
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,160
There's a box here. It looks quite special.

395
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,459
This is a gadget box. I'll give it a try.

396
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:21,140
Watch out!

397
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,599
Step back.

398
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,199
Watch out.

399
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,580
Qi!

400
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,400
- Qi! 
 - Young Yue!

401
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,240
Jinzhao, let Physician Bian check on Young Yue.

402
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,910
Qi.

403
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,386
Give her this medicine. It can suppress the poison for now.

404
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,160
Any more hesitation and she'll be dead.

405
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,790
Shifang.

406
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,830
Here.

407
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,000
Qi.

408
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,379
Physician Bian, how is she?

409
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:18,720
Her condition is stable for now.

410
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,520
What do you mean "for now"?

411
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,520
If it wasn't for you breaking in, Qi wouldn't be unconscious.

412
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,719
If something happens to her, I will never let you off.

413
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,959
I don't want anything to happen to her either.

414
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,199
Qi. Qi.

415
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,410
I want some water.

416
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,000
You all go rest. I'll take care of Qi.

417
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:58,480
Th-Then we'll leave now.

418
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,700
Qi.

419
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,380
- Water. 
 - Water.

420
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,759
Here, water.

421
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,360
Young Master Yue, is she really your sister?

422
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,599
You're not acting like a normal elder brother.

423
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,079
 These two seem to be a pair. 

424
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,439
 I'm not acting like a normal elder brother? 

425
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,319
Why is Physician Bian so upset?

426
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Physicians are kind.

427
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,120
Miss Yue was seriously injured. As a physician, he could do nothing.

428
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,680
This kind of feeling should be like us watching those disciples commit suicide,

429
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,019
yet we could do nothing.

430
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,759
I don't think so.

431
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,300
Senior Xian Qing, why didn't I see you earlier?

432
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,639
I put that box in the cottage.

433
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,470
Do you all want to see it?

434
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,999
Preoccupied with Miss Yue's injury, we forgot about this.

435
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,840
Let's go together.

436
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,319
You go first, I'll be right behind you.

437
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,999
Let's go.

438
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,859
Physician Bian, are you worried about Little Yue's injuries?

439
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,580
As a physician, I failed to detoxify Miss Yue.

440
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,999
I'm bound to get a little frustrated.

441
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,600
If those disciples hadn't died,

442
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,680
Young Zhaoyan could have followed the clues,

443
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,799
found out who was behind this, and gotten the antidote.

444
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,519
This way, Young Yue wouldn't have to suffer this.

445
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,940
Physician Bian, don't you think so?

446
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,239
Brother Xian Qing, you seem to be implying something.

447
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:19,980
