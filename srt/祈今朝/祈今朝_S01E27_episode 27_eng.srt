00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,216
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14

♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,324
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:38,276
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,199
Murderer!

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Maiming!

22
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,260
Maiming.

23
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,800
Maiming. Maiming. Maiming.

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,573
Congratulations.

25
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:32,260
- Maiming. 
 - You got your revenge.

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,140
It was you! You killed my father!

27
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,430
Don't come any closer!

28
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:45,459
My Zhaoyan is such an innocent and upright silly girl.

29
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,139
Maiming. Maiming.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,196
You're Zhaoyan?

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,280
You're both in this together.

32
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,139
It's you! You also helped kill my father!

33
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,429
You're also a murderer!

34
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:12,740
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

35
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,899
- Take him away first. 
 - Okay.

36
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,680
Hold on.

37
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,680
 Don't run! 

38
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,480
Maiming.

39
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,059
Maiming.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,980
Hold on.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,659
Maiming. Maiming.

42
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,440
Maiming. Maiming.

43
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,720
Maiming.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Maiming.

45
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,040
Maiming!

46
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,799
You mustn't die, Maiming.

47
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,599
- Maiming. 
 - You silly girl...

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,060
I racked my brains to drive you out of the Luo family...

49
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,600
just to keep you from getting hurt.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,359
Why are you so silly... and stubborn?

51
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,460
I wasn't stubborn.

52
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,109
Maiming, you're my only family.

53
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:29,499
I'll listen to you from now on. I won't let you die. You can't die.

54
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:33,100
Maiming! You can't die.

55
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,260
You shouldn't cry.

56
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:46,139
It... isn't easy for me to finally... die.

57
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,779
Moreover, a murderer...

58
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,699
is to be killed in return.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
No. Maiming, you can't die.

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,920
You can't die.

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,140
Rehai.

62
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,529
Rehai has the life force. It can save you, right?

63
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,259
Re...

64
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,290
Silly girl.

65
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,600
You're... the guardian of Rehai now.

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,959
I don't want it. I don't want it.

67
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,908
I don't want it.

68
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,480
Though I'm already deeply trapped in an endless abyss,

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,260
yet still, I wish you enjoy endless peace and joy.

70
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,760
Zhaoyan...

71
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:06,818
The condemnation of Heaven on the Luo family... has finally ended.

72
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,559
Maiming.

73
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm so tired.

74
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,660
I want to rest for a while.

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,400
No.

76
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
Maiming...

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,700
Maiming. Maiming!

78
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,279
Maiming!

79
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,599
Maiming.

80
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,040
 Why have you returned? 

81
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,832
 According to the original plan, 

82
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,980
 we should have found a remote village to hide in temporarily 

83
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,361
 and come back to look for Master after the storm subsided. 

84
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,719
 I have but three days to live. 

85
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:28,279
 In that case, I might as well die where I should die. 

86
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,939
 Will you really be satisfied if you can just die? 

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,900
 I consider myself to be a very greedy person. 

88
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,240
 Very greedy. 

89
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,579
 When the time comes... hand this letter to them. 

90
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:54,808
♫  Like silk threads, weaving into mist in the painting  ♫

91
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:59,568
♫  And into rainbows that worry and care  ♫ 
    

92
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:04,639
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

93
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,377
 See you in the next life. 

94
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:09,580
 The next life? 

95
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,179
 My life has been entangled with the condemnation of Heaven for many years. 

96
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,959
 At the time of lifting the bloodbinding of Rehai, 

97
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:22,210
 in order to prevent Zhaoyan from getting hurt, it was forcibly stopped. 

98
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,740
 I no longer have a next life. 

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 Take care. 

100
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:43,301
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

101
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:49,477
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

102
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,664
a♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

103
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:07,024
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

104
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:13,505
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

105
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:20,415
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

106
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:43,359
This is Maiming's secret chamber.

107
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,760
I never entered here before.

108
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,520
This...

109
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,860
Isn't this the painting I drew?

110
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:08,399
 He kept my paintings well preserved. 

111
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:16,605
 I highly value the paintings you gave me. 

112
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,420
 We're connected. 

113
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,456
 I always care about you. 

114
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:41,780
 It's just a pity that I couldn't see your paintings... 

115
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:48,368
 together with you like I had wished to. 

116
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:55,460
 In the next life, I'll join you to see all the scenery in the world. 

117
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,300
 The next life? 

118
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,240
 All right. 

119
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:17,639
Maiming...

120
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,800
He's fulfilled his own wishes in all the paintings.

121
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,480
In my dream yesterday,

122
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,700
I dreamed of what happened to the Luo family on the day of the Rehai bloodbinding.

123
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:55,099
Maiming's soul was thus permanently trapped here.

124
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:01,160
Because I had to lend my life to him, I was destined to pass away early.

125
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:07,279
So I told Maiming...

126
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,400
that I was willing to lend my life to him,

127
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,460
and I was also willing to live and die with him.

128
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,920
Why wouldn't he just believe me?

129
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,165
 Having been lonely for so long, 

130
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,720
 you suddenly met someone who would rather give up her own life... 

131
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,909
 than give up on you. 

132
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,230
 Is... that why you forcibly terminated the spell then? 

133
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,559
 Luo Maiming. 

134
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,214
Perhaps it was just for me...

135
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,639
that Maiming rushed to lift the bloodbinding.

136
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,780
Luo Maiming could continuously borrow life to be reborn,

137
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,900
while I, Luo Zhaoyan, have only one life.

138
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,619
He killed so many people,

139
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,140
he did deserve to be killed.

140
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,099
But in this world,

141
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:15,340
I'm the one least qualified to condemn him.

142
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,140
Xian Qing,

143
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,639
I don't know what to do.

144
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
If that's the case,

145
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:34,660
then use the rest of your life to atone for his crime.

146
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,500
Atone for his crime?

147
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Atone for his crime?

148
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:54,460
Atone for his crime?

149
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,280
Is that possible?

150
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,940
Definitely.

151
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,160
Zhaoyan,

152
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,439
I'll do it together with you.

153
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,020
I have something I need to do.

154
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,260
But I want to go alone.

155
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,806
I know you want to accompany me.

156
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,590
This is the final matter as the Luo family's master.

157
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,619
I want to handle it myself.

158
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,560
All right.

159
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,431
Do you see her?

160
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:42,059
The Luo family members in the Western Regions all died because of this person.

161
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,440
Hasn't the Luo family's reputation always been good?

162
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,800
It changed since the day of the grand family ceremony.

163
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,179
It's said that over a hundred people were killed.

164
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,539
- Over a hundred people were killed? 
 - Over a hundred people were killed?

165
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:51,779
She's such a female demon!

166
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,990
Wh-What is she here for? What is she doing here?

167
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,930
   

168
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,659
- Definitely up to no good. 
 - Let's go have a look.

169
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,479
She's definitely up to no good.

170
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,519
Luo Zhaoyan, what are you doing here?

171
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,660
This... This wasn't us!

172
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,040
This was smashed by the families of those you've killed.

173
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,800
Don't worry. I won't harm you.

174
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,720
By the way, I won't continue to serve in your home.

175
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,040
I... I'm afraid to be criticized by people behind my back.

176
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,120
 - What is this? 
 - Yes. 

177
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,229
Everyone, I'm the former Master of the Luo family, Luo Zhaoyan.

178
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:39,139
Today, I ask all present to bear witness.

179
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:42,539
From today on, all the properties under the name of Maiming and I

180
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,323
shall belong to the stewards and clerks.

181
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:49,360
And please also help me sell off all the properties that we've deposited

182
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,260
to money dealers and other places, to compensate the families of the deceased.

183
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,610
I am here today.

184
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,979
If any of you have any grievances or hatred, feel free to take it out on me.

185
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,008
Do not harm the innocent.

186
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:08,220
I'm the only one to scrape by in this world.

187
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,739
My mother says you're a murderous lunatic!

188
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,099
Kill her!

189
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,460
 - Kill her! 
 - I'll kill you! 

190
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,439
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

191
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:21,960
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

192
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,020
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

193
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,659
 She deceived people! 

194
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,759
 Murderous lunatic! 

195
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,461
 - Shameless! 
 - Kill her! 

196
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,299
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

197
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,299
 I'll kill you! 

198
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,240
 - Kill her! 
 - Kill her! 

199
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,972
Enough!

200
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,199
 Who is this? 

201
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:54,919
Didn't I say I would come alone?

202
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,960
You can come. I can follow too.

203
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,940
Most of you aren't related to the Luo family.

204
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,540
Over the years, you've also received favors from the Luo family.

205
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,119
Yet today you turned against them so quickly.

206
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Come on.

207
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,679
Keep throwing!

208
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:21,779
 - Go. 
 - Let's go. 

209
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,279
- Xian Qing. 
  - Come on. 

210
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
Let's go.

211
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,290
- Thank you. 
 - If other people can't scold you,

212
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,919
what about me?

213
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,739
Can I scold you?

214
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,939
 - She knelt down. 
 - She knelt down. 

215
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,600
For the rest of my life, I will atone for this.

216
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,439
From now on,

217
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,779
I will no longer set foot in Yinghui Fort.

218
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,079
True.

219
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,219
How dare Luo Maiming, who slaughtered all his own kin,

220
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,320
and you, Luo Zhaoyan,

221
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,699
ever come back here again?

222
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,780
This entire place has been stained by the blood of those you two killed.

223
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:43,919
Luo Zhaoyan,

224
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:46,939
you're cold-blooded and heartless,

225
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,819
and no different from a demon that devours humans alive!

226
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,964
You don't deserve to be a human!

227
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,799
Get out!

228
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,860
Kneeling down once is enough.

229
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:17,339
It's not your fault anyway.

230
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:19,999
Let's go.

231
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:28,039
Luo Zhaoyan! I hate you!

232
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,164
I hate you.

233
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:36,599
 - Go. 
 - Go. 

234
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,690
 - Let's leave. 
 - Let's leave. 

235
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,490
I hate you...

236
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,020
Zhaoyan,

237
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,824
what do you plan to do next?

238
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:55,539
As long as righteousness remains intact, there will still be a path to follow.

239
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,160
For the rest of my life,

240
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,639
I will try to do more good deeds to atone for the sins of Maiming and me.

241
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,840
I seek no fame or fortune, just to stay true to myself.

242
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:11,219
No matter how the world sees you,

243
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,040
I will always be by your side.

244
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,159
 Qi, 

245
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,352
 where on the earth are you? 

246
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,930
Brother Yue.

247
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,330
Have a seat.

248
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,080
Brother Yue, sorry to make you worry lately.

249
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,220
Miss Yue's whereabouts remain unknown.

250
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,940
Yet you've been implicated and can't go search for her.

251
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,160
I also failed to ask Maiming for clues in time.

252
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,060
I'm truly sorry.

253
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,160
The Luo family has encountered such a disaster. It has distracted you.

254
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,820
Besides, I have been searching everywhere these past two days,

255
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,160
and I still can't find the location of the Yujie Hub.

256
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,219
So it's all the same wherever I am.

257
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,879
Don't you and Miss Yue have the Mindlink?

258
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:42,200
Can't you sense each other's whereabouts?

259
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,940
Yes. I've tried that also.

260
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,240
The resonance between Qi and I seems to be blocked by some external force.

261
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,420
It must be something Ying Xuwei's done.

262
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,599
De'er! De'er!

263
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,369
Have you seen my De'er?

264
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,339
De...

265
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,512
Have you seen my De'er?

266
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:09,820
Uncle, who is De'er?

267
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,199
So you haven't seen him either.

268
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:16,699
De'er! De'er!

269
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,326
It must be because of something your Luo family did in secret.

270
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:24,599
Otherwise, Uncle Nian's grandson's treatments would be going well.

271
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,219
Why did he suddenly turn into stone a few days ago?

272
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:32,879
Sir, other than that person's grandson, are there any others who've turned to stone?

273
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,280
How did you know?

274
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,860
So you all really have something to do with this?!

275
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,080
All right, stop talking. Aren't you afraid they'll harm you? Let's hurry and go.

276
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Go, go.

277
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,920
Although the headquarters of the Qiyuan Sect has been destroyed,

278
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,220
there could still be some that slipped through the net.

279
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,719
The Luo family originally had significant influence in this area,

280
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:53,060
so we could've deterred them to some extent.

281
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,519
But now...

282
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,719
The Hengdao Sect must be related to this.

283
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,840
Why don't we send a message to Leader Zuo

284
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,759
and ask the Righteous Martial Alliance to help protect the citizens of Yinghui Fort,

285
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,899
and also ask him to join us to search for the Hengdao Sect.

286
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,419
Are you Yue Jinzhao?

287
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,760
Someone asked me to give you this letter.

288
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,773
It's Qi's jade pendant.

289
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,060
   

290
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,060
Lock River Mountain?

291
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,400
I've never heard of this place before.

292
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,639
But since they've sent the letter,

293
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:39,099
how about you try the Mindlink again?

294
00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:53,279
I seem to... have found her.

295
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,320
I seem to have found Qi.

296
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,799
I'll send a message to Young Xiu to have her and Young Shifang meet up with us.

297
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,459
Why would the Hengdao Sect give us a location that no one knows,

298
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:19,960
and deliberately cut off your connection with Young Yue?

299
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,776
Looks like they're trying to lure us there.

300
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:30,459
They also want to see whether I can find Qi again by relying on Mindlink.

301
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,504
It's on the north side.

302
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,060
What's wrong?

303
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,284
The Mindlink seems to have failed again.

304
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,340
- Jinzhao! 
 - Shifang.

305
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,959
Jinzhao!

306
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,859
It's still not enough.

307
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,799
It doesn't matter. If it's necessary, we can assist you.

308
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,560
It's useless. I can only rely on myself.

309
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,680
The Mindlink is only related to mine and Qi's feelings.

310
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,380
This time...

311
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,680
I must rely on myself.

312
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,119
Jinzhao, there must be another way. Please don't hurt yourself.

313
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,240
 Try again. 

314
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,659
 If it's still unsuccessful, 

315
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,940
 even if I have to search every inch of the divine land, 

316
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,727
 I must find Qi. 

317
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,668
You found it! You found it!

318
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:55,900
I heard about what happened these past few days.

319
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,109
I didn't expect that...

320
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:59,390
It's okay, Miss Ming Xiu.

321
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,493
Thank you for your concern.

322
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,600
I've decided...

323
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,610
to live on carrying Maiming's efforts, as a continuation of his life.

324
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,079
I understand.

325
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,780
Young Xiu.

326
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,460
Have you brought the thing I asked you to bring to me?

327
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:26,400
Thank you.

328
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,427
Keep the medicine safe.

329
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,119
These are all that's left of what Master refined for you.

330
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:35,479
If you continue to casually give away your energy to others,

331
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:38,519
sooner or later you'll turn back into your original form.

332
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,240
Zhaoyan likes my skin and fur quite a bit.

333
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,160
If that day really comes, Zhaoyan will take me in.

334
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,060
No problem.

335
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,060
I-It's just that I'm penniless right now.

336
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,819
If you follow me in the future, you might have to become vegetarian.

337
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,170
I've had quite a bit of meat. Trying out vegetarianism isn't bad.

338
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:17,409
Jinzhao, why would the Hengdao Sect want to capture Young Yue?

339
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,525
Maybe there's a breakdown in the dealings between Zhu Yu and the Hengdao Sect.

340
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:25,126
So the Hengdao Sect took Qi as a hostage.

341
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,820
Nine Springs. The Hengdao Sect. The Sea of Clear Skies.

342
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,499
All of this is like a mystery, enveloping Qi and me.

343
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,940
To unravel all these mysteries, I can only ask Ying Xuwei.

344
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,898
Look! There's a city floating in the sky over there!

345
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:57,334
 Qi, wait for me. 

346
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
Truly unlike the mortal world.

347
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,969
It's inferior to the azure beyond, yet it's at the pinnacle of the human world.

348
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:23,890
Making a fuss over nothing. Doesn't the Yunlai Stone also move through the sky?

349
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,219
No, no. You don't know.

350
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:31,440
This city is not floating by magic or energy, but by mechanics.

351
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,499
You're quite knowledgeable.

352
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,509
Where is Qi? I want to see her.

353
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:41,629
If you want to see her, you have to get past me first.

354
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:45,709
Wasn't it you who called us here? Why do we still have to fight?

355
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:49,399
You hurt my third brother so much. I have to teach you a lesson!

356
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,440
 Xiaoyuan, what did Eldest Brother tell you just now? 

357
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,900
 Do you want to be punished by him? 

358
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,399
 Eldest Brother has something to say specifically to Yue Jinzhao and Yue Qi. 

359
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,270
 You can follow her to the guest room. 

360
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,270
You want to stop us?

361
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,419
Young Xiu, since we're here, let's settle in.

362
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,148
We need to trust Jinzhao and Young Yue.

363
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,540
Lead the way.

364
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,737
Follow me.

365
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:24,555
She's right inside.

366
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,220
 Jinzhao! 

367
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,080
   

368
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,659
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

369
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,594
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

370
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:56,643

♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

390
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:01,270
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

391
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,080
Stupid Jinzhao, why did it take so long for you to get here?

392
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,693
It's my fault, I made you stay here for so long.

393
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,644
How are you? They didn't give you a hard time, did they?

394
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,800
You two,

395
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
Eldest Brother has been waiting for you for a long time.

396
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,319
Don't you want to know about your origins?

397
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:26,359
Then follow me.

398
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,040


399

♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

400
