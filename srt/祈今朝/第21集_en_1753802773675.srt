00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Our precious guest has arrived.

YoYo English Channel YouTube

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's been a long time.

9
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The leader of the Nine Marquis, Ying Tongling,

10
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
is a great warrior.

11
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He can fight against the hot sea.

12
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He must be one of the Nine Fists.

13
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I wonder which Fist of the Fist is the best.

14
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Martial Soul.

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I met Dr. Bian a few days ago.

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have many doubts in my mind.

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You came here this time

18
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
because of the hot sea.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Commander Ying is really honest.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I heard that the Zhenwu Alliance was trying to destroy the Qiyuan Sect.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The crowd recognized Miss Yue as the leader.

22
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Not only that,

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Miss Yue also had a coma.

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mr. Luo, you are in time.

25
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It seems that Luo Zhaoyan has already known about it.

26
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Qiyuan Sect sent out the Qiyuan Bead.

27
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's the West Division of the Lord of the Palace.

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now the Qiyuan Sect is destroyed.

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Has the Qiyuan Bead been collected enough?

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now that you have guessed it, why do you ask?

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Nonsense.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There are many other questions that I don't understand.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
For example, what is the connection between the Sea of Heaven and the Taoism Seeker?

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
As the guardian of Martial Soul,

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
why are you interested in the hot sea?

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am interested in the Hot Sea.

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For our better cooperation,

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I hope you can be honest with me.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I hope we can cooperate happily.

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the Hot Sea Pill?

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This Hot Sea Pill is the key to the spell.

42
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It is made from the dragon bone of the turtle.

43
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When the gods used the dragon bone as the foundation

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to make the Hot Sea Pill,

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I made another one to confuse the spell.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Interesting.

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The Hot Sea Pill can be forged.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ceng Feng,

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
keep it.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ceng Feng,

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
now you are also the guardian of the Hot Sea.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Thank you, Hou Ai.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Next time we meet,

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
we will design the thing to deal with Zhu Yu.

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Since I have agreed to help you to deceive Zhu Yu,

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
as a exchange,

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
should Commander Ying show his sincerity?

58
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know if my brother-in-law's method is sincere enough.

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why is it not sincere enough?

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Brother-in-law's method is to force the gods to disobey the laws.

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Only by using the blood of the kin to drive the secret method can it be broken.

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The more blood of the kin,

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the more likely it will succeed.

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Blood of the kin?

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There is another method.

66
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The blood of the whole clan can be exchanged for the blood of the kin.

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Zhao Yan,

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you finally come back.

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why do you look like this?

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you do something good and didn't tell me?

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, Man Min.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Miss Ming has something to ask.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going to the dragon pond.

74
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I heard that the dragon pond of Jiuquan can bring back the dead.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I want to take the hot sea to the dragon pond.

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Miss Luo, please help me.

77
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Man Min.

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The whole dragon pond is full of powerful weapons.

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not easy to enter.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to the dragon pond.

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can enter.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Miss Ming looks pale.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why don't you rest for a night and get ready?

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We'll enter the dragon pond tomorrow.

85
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you.

86
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Have you settled your friends?

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, Man Min.

88
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll go find Xian Qing and the others.

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Zhao Yan,

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have something to tell you.

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can reveal the hot sea to others.

92
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It seems that you have regarded them as your most important partners.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We are both friends.

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We have been living and dying together for a long time.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I believe in them.

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't believe in anyone.

97
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I only believe in you.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's going on between you and that wolf demon?

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A branch of branches

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The flowers in the lotus

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm the one who knows you best in this world.

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can't hide it from me.

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Man Min, I've never hidden it from you.

104
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll tell you the truth.

105
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know what kind of heart I have now.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've always said that I'm short-lived.

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I want to let Luo family live in a limited time.

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But now...

109
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You're short-lived.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're all because I married you.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're willing to live with a man for the consequences.

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You really don't hate this fate?

113
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't you hate me?

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Bai Ming,

115
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I've never changed my mind.

116
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you say you have no complaints,

117
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
that's a lie.

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I think,

119
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
since life is short and you're a fixed number,

120
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
why don't you think about how to live a more wonderful life?

121
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm a man.

122
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm walking the world more freely.

123
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I've also made a lot of friends.

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm very happy, Bai Ming.

125
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Really.

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Then...

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're a woman.

128
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They know that.

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But they promised to protect me.

130
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If that's the case,

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't need to be caught anymore.

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Zhao Yan,

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have a gift for you.

134
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A gift?

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,200
The flowers are looking at the liu-ying,

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
while the moon is looking at the beautiful man.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
My Chaoyan

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
is beautiful.

187
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
can I change it back?

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's not comfortable to wear it like this.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's not strange to have a life partner.

191
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Why don't you

192
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,720
experience the life of a woman now?

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,120
Or do you think

194
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,800
what I prepared

195
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
is not your cup of tea?

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Fine.

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,900

in a popular open day in flight,

200
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,940
for 14.5 years.

201
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,160
This is a mission

202
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,240
with Beilei moral value.

203
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,040
That's why,

204
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,620
I've got additional information

205
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,240
to know about

206
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,880
as many as possible.

207
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,440

and aslander,

209
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,880
I've got a concept

210
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,720
to analyse

211
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,640

212
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,940

216
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,440

I saw you.

225
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,020
Lyrics translated by Hoopra

226
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,920
What words can describe the feeling?

227
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,320
Why am I like you?

228
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,720
A smile melts the heart.

229
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,280
I want to see you.

230
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,640
Even if I don't want to be careful,

231
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,240
I keep hearing

232
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,880
so many rumors.

233
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,120
I'm sure I'm like you.

234
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,680
A hug is enough to replace my memory.

235
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,600
A look is enough to make us unique.

236
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,960
What words can describe the feeling?

237
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Why am I like you?

238
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,680
A smile melts the heart.

239
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,240
I want to see you.

240
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
Even if I don't want to be careful,

241
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,120
I keep hearing

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,000
so many rumors.

243
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,240
I'm sure I'm like you.

244
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,800
Zhao...

245
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,920
Don't disturb them.

246
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,920
Zhao Yan is really a girl.

247
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,400
Didn't you find her?

248
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,520
I just

249
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,240
feel a little strange.

250
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,720
It seems that I can't call you Brother Luo anymore.

251
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,200
Just call me Zhao Yan.

252
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,080
Zeyi!

253
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,480
Hoping you'll love me.

254
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,720
I like you.

255
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,920
Are you warm?

256
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:09,500
Liu Five auspicious

257
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,760
You're...

258
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,080
You're Miss Luo.

259
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,260
You guys are secretly Taoist.

260
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,480
I naturally don't have to

261
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,620
hide anything in front of you guys.

262
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm Luo Maiming.

263
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Miss Luo has become a child of Luo.

264
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,360
We need to get used to it.

265
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,640
What about Zhao Yan?

266
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,560
Zhao Yan is ill.

267
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,880
He's not feeling well.

268
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,480
Let me take you to the hot sea first.

269
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
How is he?

270
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
He's sick.

271
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,200
He'll be fine after a short rest.

272
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,320
With Zhao Yan's temperament,

273
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,720
he'll send us a ride

274
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,360
even if he's sick.

275
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,400
passing out.

276
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,600
Sorry to ask,

277
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,220
he can't be restored.

278
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,720
What's wrong, Uncle Luo?

279
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,160
Tartar House

280
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Why is Xianqing gone?

281
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,520
Yeah.

282
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,200
She was following us just now.

283
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,600
Master should have something important to deal with.

284
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,960
Let's go to the dragon pond first.

285
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,960
Yeah.

286
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,760
Let's deal with Mr. Gu first.

287
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
Then we can meet them.

288
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,520
Let's go.

289
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,000
Hand gym.

290
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,760
It's...

291
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,920
Zhou Ying.

292
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Man Ming.

294
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Man Ming.

295
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
What are you doing?

296
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
Yesterday,

297
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
a guest came to visit.

298
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Guess what they told me.

299
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
They told me

300
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
how to get rid of the blood phoenix.

301
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Really?

302
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Back then,

303
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I thought

304
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
I only needed to sacrifice myself.

305
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
But I fell into a trap.

306
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
I kept turning and living by my own will.

307
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I was living a life of a ghost.

308
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
I know.

309
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I know, Man Ming.

310
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,360
You've been suffering from the Luo family's torture and torture.

311
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
So you really have a way, right?

312
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Yes.

313
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
He said

314
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,360
only the blood of a loved one could be cured.

315
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,360
Blood that needs to be revived.

316
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Zhao Yan.

317
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Do you still remember

318
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,360
the fact that you were going to die with me?

319
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
I remember.

320
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Of course I remember.

321
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,360
But I just want you to tell me the truth.

322
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
Why did you lock me up?

323
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Because you have no one else.

324
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
You're not the Zhao Yan you used to be.

325
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
What's going on?

326
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
The intruder.

327
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
The intruder.

328
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Are you Longtan Wei Shu?

329
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
We're with the Wu Gou Guardian.

330
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
We want to go to Longtan Quan Yan.

331
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Please make yourself at home.

332
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
The Wu Gou Guardian?

333
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
The guardian is hiding in the dark.

334
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
This is...

335
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Miss Ming.

336
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Please rest.

337
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Please hurry up.

338
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Hurry up.

339
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
You'll be lost forever

340
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
in the maze of memories.

341
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Where's Xian Qing and the others?

342
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
You didn't hurt them, did you?

343
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
You still think about them.

344
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Where are they, Mai Ming?

345
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Don't hurt them, okay?

346
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,360
I shouldn't have let you go to the Sunset Village

347
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:34,820
and given you that

348
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Are you crazy?

349
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
What's wrong?

350
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Are you worried about him?

351
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Mai Ming.

352
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
After today,

353
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
Zhao Yan will be back again.

354
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Xian Qing.

355
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Xian Qing, please leave.

356
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
His target is you.

357
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
You're here.

358
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
Mai Ming.

359
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Mai Ming.

360
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Mai Ming.

361
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Xian Qing, please leave.

362
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Luo Man.

363
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
You've always been Zhao Yan.

364
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
He's done a lot for you.

365
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
If you want to play tricks on me,

366
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
why are you so patient?

367
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
He's been with me

368
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
day and night for so many years.

369
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Now I'm thinking about you.

370
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
If that's the case, I'd rather kill him.

371
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
You asked me

372
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
if you wanted to kill him?

373
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Mai Ming.

374
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Mai Ming, let him go.

375
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Xian Qing.

376
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Mai Ming, I'm begging you.

377
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
Mai Ming, I'm begging you.

378
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Let him go.

379
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
I'm begging you.

380
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Don't hurt him.

381
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Xian Qing.

382
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
Luo Man.

383
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm here.

384
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Xian Qing.

385
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,360
Wolf Demon,

386
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
if I lose a few more points,

387
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm afraid you'll die.

388
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
Again.

389
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Xian Qing.

390
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Xian Qing.

391
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Xian Qing.

392
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Xian Qing.

393
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Mother.

394
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,360
Uncle has killed the demon.

395
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
We're safe now.

396
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Today is your birthday.

397
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Birthday.

398
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I don't want to celebrate my birthday.

399
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I only want you.

400
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Mother.

401
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
Mother.

402
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Mother.

403
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Mother.

404
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Mother, wake up.

405
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Mother.

406
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Wake up, mother.

407
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Is that

408
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Miss Ming's memory?

409
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
According to

410
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
the theory of the Great God of Wei Shu,

411
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
she wanted to use your memory

412
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
to find a way to free herself.

413
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Miss Ming.

414
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
What happened

415
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
after this?

416
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Miss Ming.

417
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Escaping is useless.

418
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Miss Ming.

419
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Although I don't know

420
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
what happened back then,

421
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
but since I was adopted

422
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
by Senior Gu,

423
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
your family

424
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
will not disappear

425
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
even if you don't think

426
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
what happened.

427
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Shut up.

428
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Miss Ming.

429
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I didn't dare to come out

430
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
to see anyone

431
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
when I was hiding in the room.

432
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Senior Gu told me

433
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
to face it bravely.

434
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
I think

435
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Senior Gu wanted to tell you that.

436
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Mother.

437
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Mother.

438
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Mother.

439
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
You are hurt.

440
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Why didn't you tell me?

441
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Mother.

442
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Mother.

443
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Mother.

444
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Mother.

445
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Master.

446
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
I finally understand

447
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
why Sister Ming Xiu

448
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
hates demons so much.

449
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Miss Ming didn't want to have a child

450
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
because of this.

451
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Great God of Wei Shu.

452
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
It's right to break into the fountain.

453
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
But we also have difficulties.

454
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Please

455
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
stop this kind of hurtful trick.

456
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,360
This love and this scene

457
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
are all from her memory.

458
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I just want to restore it.

459
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
There are many kinds of memories.

460
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Sister Ming Xiu and Gu Shu

461
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
have so many beautiful memories.

462
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Why don't you show them?

463
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
It's obvious that

464
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
you are a monster

465
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
who is looking down on others.

466
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Xiu Er.

467
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Xiu Er, did you dream about me again?

468
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Master,

469
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
is there any magic

470
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
that can bring me back?

471
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
It's the greatest comfort

472
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
for the dead

473
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
to live a good life.

474
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
As long as the living

475
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
pass on the wishes and beliefs

476
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
of the dead,

477
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,360
the living will be the one who will protect the living

478
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,360
and get the continuation of life.

479
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
What's going on?

480
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Where is this?

481
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Where?

482
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
Sister Ming Xiu is missing.

483
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
What...

484
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
What is this?

485
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
It's so ugly.

486
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm happy and sad.

487
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
My feelings are like the bones.

488
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,360
I take advantage of the world's people

489
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,360
to show my feelings.

490
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,360
I'm a man of my heart.

491
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Stop talking nonsense.

492
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Where is Miss Ming?

493
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
That dog-less guardian

494
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,360
is hiding a deep obsession in her heart.

495
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,360
She doesn't want to step out of her memories.

496
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Let Sister Ming Xiu out.

497
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
If she's obsessed with it,

498
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
no one can save her.

499
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

500
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

501
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
You're really naive.

502
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
With your current power,

503
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
it's just a little bit easier for me.

504
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
You want to save her?

505
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
There's another way.

506
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Would you like to try it?

507
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
I heard

508
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
the demon elixir is the life of the demon world.

509
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
The cultivation of the elixir is very good.

510
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm curious

511
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
about the elixir.

512
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,360
How about you lending me a coffin?

513
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Sister Ming! Sister Ming!

514
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Xian Qing! No!

515
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Xian Qing!

516
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,360
No!

517
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
How can a person who doesn't know

518
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
learn to ask his wife and son

519
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
what to do?

520
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Demon elixir

521
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,360
is the life of the demon world to me.

522
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Since you want it,

523
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
why not give it to you?

524
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

525
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
There's no one in this world

526
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
who can sacrifice for her.

527
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
It's also a pleasure.

528
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
No! Xian Qing!

529
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

530
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

531
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Come on.

532
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
I heard that after the demon elixir

533
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
leaves the demon world,

534
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
you'll lose your life.

535
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

536
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Mei Bing! Mei Bing!

537
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Xian Qing!

538
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
Xian Qing!

539
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Xian Qing!

540
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Xian Qing!

541
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Mei Bing! Mei Bing!

542
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
The Demon Elixir

543
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
is just a matter between you and me.

544
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,360
You're now playing the game

545
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
of life and death?

546
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Don't you want my life?

547
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Take it as much as you can.

548
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Why do you have to hurt the innocent?

549
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
So your choice now

550
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
is because of me

551
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,360
or the demon elixir?

552
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Look at the sky, I'm like a cloud

553
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,360
I'm scattered

554
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
The shadow of love in front of me

555
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
is inseparable

556
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
It's destiny

557
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,360
Even if it's not Xian Qing,

558
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
it's Yue Xiu, it's Yue Ge,

559
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,360
even if it's those family members,

560
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
I'll try my best to protect them.

561
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
The one you can't live without

562
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
is you.

563
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
You're the one

564
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
who can't live without me.

565
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Mei Bing,

566
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,320
I've never thought about the

567
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
As long as you don't hurt anyone,

568
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
I'll help you.

569
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,360
Please,

570
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,360
don't hurt Xian Qing, okay?

571
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,360
I'll help you.

572
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,360
As long as you don't want to,

573
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
I'll live the rest of my life.

574
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Mei Bing,

575
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
So you want to

576
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,360
exchange your life for the demon's?

577
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Not exchange my life,

578
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
not exchange.

579
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,360
I don't want to see you keep doing this.

580
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Mei Bing,

581
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
as long as you're willing,

582
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
I'll be like before.

583
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
I'll be like before.

584
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Protect you.

585
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Mei Bing.

586
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Mei Bing.

587
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Mei Bing.

588
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Xian Qing.

589
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Xian Qing.

590
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Xian Qing.

591
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I'm here.

592
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
Xian Qing.

593
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Xian Qing.

594
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Mei Bing.

595
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,360
You guys go.

596
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Mei Bing.

597
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
Go back to your friends.

598
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Don't go back to Luo family again.

599
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Mei Bing.

600
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Get lost.

601
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,360
The Flowing Stars

602
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,360
The shooting stars that are flying through the sky

603
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Burned the past

604
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Forgotten the name of the heart

605
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,360
The deep feeling behind the mask

606
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Only through my eyes

607
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,360
Who can see

608
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,360
It's destined that I'll fight for you

609
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:42,360
Even if the ending is hard to escape

610
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
I'm 님 Ohio

611
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,360
Making thou words

612
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,360
effecting my decisions

613
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,060
I wish there was ring

614
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,660
not of friendship

615
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,360
not of love

616
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,820
just a bottle of lectures

617
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
I declare

618
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,360
I will be your witness

619
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Even if the ending is hard to escape

620
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I will give you a piece of my heart

621
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,360
To make you happy

622
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,360
I will give you a piece of my heart

623
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,360
To make you happy

624
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,340
The light of the

625
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
dawn

626
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Leave to love

627
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
The unspoken

628
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,340
Explain

629
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,340
It's destined to be me

630
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:26,340
For you to do your best

631
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Even if you try

632
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,340
May be repeated

633
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,320
I still care about you

634
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,320
The truth of life

635
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Leave the evidence of existence
