6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This scene,

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
is it like Miss Yue

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
that the orb of the seven elements can be absorbed?

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The orb of the seven elements can be absorbed

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
except for Xiao Yue, who is...

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ming Zhu.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother Yue, what's next?

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go and ask Uncle Lin Yuan.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He is a righteous man.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Maybe he will tell us something.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shi Fang, you wait here.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Brother Yue.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's up?

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Uncle Lin Yuan, is Zhu Yu

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the master of Qiyuan Sect?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You saw the soul fish, right?

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The emperor is Ming Zhu.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What does the sea of love

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
have to do with Qiyuan Sect?

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How do you know?

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It seems that it really has something to do with it.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Qi has borrowed the jade scroll

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to everyone.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Since he is your young lord,

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
why did you send him to the jade scroll?

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why did you send him to the jade scroll?

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's a long story.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's okay.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We have time to listen to you.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We have time to listen to you.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come with me.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come with me.

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
I only want a truth.

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
I just want the truth.

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Are you ready to face the cruelty of the truth?

43
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
You can say it.

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
This is a long story.

45
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Come.

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
The sea of the sky used to be much more beautiful and prosperous than it is now.

47
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Until that disaster.

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
What disaster?

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Come on.

50
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Come on.

51
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Come on.

52
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Come on.

53
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Come on.

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
After the disaster,

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
we knew that

56
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
for hundreds of years,

57
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
we had been living on Kun's back.

58
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
It's a pity that

59
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Kun is awake.

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Kun.

61
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Who noticed?

62
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Kun's life will definitely change.

63
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
And the process of changing

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
will be painful and even death

65
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
because of the drastic changes in a short period of time.

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
The Martial Soul can develop time.

67
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Therefore,

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
for generations,

69
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
we will use the Martial Soul to slow down time

70
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
and slow down the process of transformation

71
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
to reduce the pain.

72
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
And when I was transforming,

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I found that

74
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
the fish tribe lived on my back.

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
I was so happy.

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
The fish tribe lived on my back.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
And the process of transformation

78
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
almost caused the fish tribe

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
to suffer a disaster.

80
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I couldn't watch the fish tribe die.

81
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
So,

82
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I used the Martial Soul to slow down the transformation

83
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,160
to absorb the spiritual power of the nine powers

84
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
to heal the fish tribe.

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
But if we do this,

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:07:15,740
the fish tribe will be in a state of

87
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
a lifetime.

88
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
But for humans,

89
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
a lifetime is a lifetime.

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
What you said

91
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
is exactly what Ying Xunwei said.

92
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
The Martial Soul is about to be back.

93
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Could it be that there is also a full moon here?

94
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
That's right.

95
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
His Majesty has possessed the Martial Soul.

96
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
The Martial Soul is right there.

97
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Every time I see the full moon,

98
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I feel so blessed.

99
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
I feel so blessed.

100
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
The fish tribe

101
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
should have been wiped out in the last disaster.

102
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
It was the Queen of the Lingye

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
who used her last strength

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
to stop Kun from being reborn.

105
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Later,

106
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Kun became the new emperor

107
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,160
with the help of the Queen of the Lingye.

108
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
These are...

109
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,160
These are the people who were seriously injured

110
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
in the last disaster.

111
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
His Majesty has been treating them.

112
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I hope that one day,

113
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
they will wake up.

114
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
They look just like humans.

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I understand.

116
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Because of the Martial Soul,

117
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
you are here to contact Heng Daozhong.

118
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Ying Xunwei.

119
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
You are indeed in contact with Heng Daozhong.

120
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
When I was trying to get the Martial Soul,

121
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Ying Xunwei found me.

122
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
She asked me to use the power of the Martial Soul

123
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
to lead the fish tribe to attack in time.

124
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Attack in time?

125
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Is it to lock you up?

126
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Almost.

127
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
She put us in a place

128
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
where time almost stops.

129
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Then they thought of a way

130
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
to heal the fish tribe.

131
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
What happened next?

132
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Then we reached an agreement.

133
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
They collected a lot of life power

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
to heal the fish tribe.

135
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
After the fish tribe was healed,

136
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
they were able to get out of the water.

137
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I then opened the blood of the Martial Soul.

138
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
A lot of life power?

139
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Could it be...

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
That's right.

141
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Ying Xunwei

142
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
found a small sect in the mortal world

143
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
to support the strong.

144
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
They took a walk

145
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
to find the Qi Yuan Pearl

146
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
to help me absorb the life power

147
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
to heal the fish tribe.

148
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Zhuyu.

149
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
So you are really the Master.

150
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
You are the one who caused so many people to die.

151
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You are the one who sacrificed

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
so many lives.

153
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
But I can't just

154
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
watch the fish tribe disappear.

155
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
The life of the fish tribe is life.

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Isn't the life of the human being life?

157
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Everything has passed.

158
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
But the past

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
can't be changed.

160
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Zhuyu.

161
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
I have another question.

162
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Why did I grow up in the Jade Sword Book?

163
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
I was born in the Jade Sword Book.

164
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
I was born in the Jade Sword Book.

165
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Why did I grow up in the Jade Sword Book?

166
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
You are right.

167
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Although Heng Daozhong has an appointment with us,

168
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
he is still worried.

169
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
They want to make the new young lord a hostage

170
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
to control the King and the sea of heaven.

171
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
I am innocent.

172
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
You are actually taking him as a hostage.

173
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
What about me?

174
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Why is my memory blank?

175
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Yue.

176
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Your identity is secret.

177
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
If you keep investigating,

178
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm afraid it will endanger your life.

179
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Why are you so persistent?

180
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Where is Heng Daozhong?

181
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
I don't know.

182
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
The one who has been in contact with us

183
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
is the second commander of Heng Daozhong, Ge Qingfei.

184
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Okay.

185
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
If you don't say it,

186
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
I'll find a way to find him.

187
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
It turns out that

188
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
in the eyes of those in Heng Daozhong,

189
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I am just threatening to shake your hostage.

190
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Those happy times

191
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
are just a fake.

192
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
What about Jinzhao?

193
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
What does he have to do with the Jade Sword Book?

194
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Please

195
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
don't ask anymore.

196
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
I don't want to hurt you.

197
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Okay?

198
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Don't ask anymore.

199
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I can bear those wounds.

200
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Zhuyu.

201
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Jinzhao is the person

202
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
I care about the most in this world.

203
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Why do you always hide from me

204
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
about his things and lie to me?

205
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
You still don't want to tell me, right?

206
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Okay.

207
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
If you don't tell me,

208
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I'll go find him myself.

209
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
No.

210
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I don't know if I still have a chance

211
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
to see Miss Shouxuan again.

212
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Miss Shouxuan.

213
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Why are you here?

214
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm waiting for Xiaoyue here.

215
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
She's here too?

216
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Miss Shouxuan.

217
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
I'm not eating fish anymore.

222
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Miss Shouxuan.

223
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
What else is there?

224
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I...

225
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
I told you last time

226
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
that I wanted to be a hero.

227
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
You didn't hear me, right?

228
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Now I...

229
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I don't want to be a hero anymore.

230
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
What happened

231
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
that made you so self-conscious?

232
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
A few days ago,

233
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
a senior who was good to us

234
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
died because of me.

235
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I used to

236
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
tell myself

237
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
that I wanted to be a hero

238
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
and a big sister.

239
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
But...

240
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
But the birth of a hero

241
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
usually comes with a lot of death and injuries.

242
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I don't want to be a hero anymore.

243
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
So what?

244
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
They're not good enough.

245
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
They can't be a hero anymore.

246
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
No, no.

247
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
No.

248
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
If the premise of being a hero

249
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
is to sacrifice a lot of people,

250
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,160
I'd rather not be a hero.

251
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
You're so weird.

252
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Miss Shouxuan.

253
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
The Lu Ban Suo I gave you last time...

254
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
Throw it away.

255
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Xia Chi Fang.

256
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
You're still looking at it.

257
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
You're so far away.

258
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
Every time you see him,

259
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
he's always like this to you.

260
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
What do you like about him?

261
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Miss Shouxuan,

262
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,160
she never seems to be confused.

263
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
She always moves forward with a straight face.

264
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
She's totally different from me.

265
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
She's very dazzling.

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Miss Shouxuan.

267
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Are you interested in that boy?

268
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
How is that possible?

269
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
But why are they here?

270
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
They must have guessed

271
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
that we were related to the Taoism of the Taoism of the Red Robe.

272
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
They just came to verify it.

273
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Then you told them everything?

274
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I wouldn't say anything that I shouldn't have.

275
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm not going to tell you.

276
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm going to tell you everything.

277
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Of course I won't.

278
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
What kind of feeling is this?

279
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
It's even more painful than the first time we met.

280
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Young Master.

281
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
My Lord.

282
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
This is the dessert Young Ener strands sent.

283
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
The smell of mother.

284
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
According to his friend,

285
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
this is his favorite pastry in the mortal world.

286
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
My sense of smell

287
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
has almost disappeared.

288
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
It's not a good thing.

289
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
If Qi feels good,

290
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
then it's good.

291
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Your Majesty,

292
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Young Master has recovered his memory.

293
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Soon,

294
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
he will know the truth.

295
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I'm afraid he won't be able to accept the blow.

296
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
He also absorbed the Qi Yuan Bead.

297
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Why didn't he like me

298
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
be swallowed by the dark emotions of the human?

299
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Compared to Your Majesty,

300
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
the Qi Yuan Bead absorbed by Young Master

301
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
is a little bit more.

302
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
And,

303
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Your Majesty,

304
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
you're too lonely.

305
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
You're too tired.

306
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Why did he have to leave?

307
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Why didn't he want to stay with me?

308
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Your Majesty.

309
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Why?

310
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
Why?

311
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
I dare not.

312
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm willing to be bullied.

313
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I dare not.

314
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
Your Majesty.

315
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
The dark emotions of the human

316
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,160
are not because I'm not able to control them.

317
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Your Majesty.

318
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I dare not to control them.

319
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
I dare not to control them.

320
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Your Majesty.

321
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Your Majesty.

322
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Your Majesty.

323
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Your Majesty.

324
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Your Majesty, calm down.

325
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Your Majesty.

326
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I dare not

327
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
I dare not

328
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
to face

329
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
pain.

330
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Girl,

331
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
our fish tribe and humans are different.

332
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
So...

333
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
No!

334
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Your Majesty.

335
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Your Majesty.

336
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't move.

337
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
Young Master.

338
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Your Majesty.

339
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Your Majesty.

340
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Your Majesty.

341
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Your Majesty!

342
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Your Majesty!

343
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Save me!

344
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
Save me!

345
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Save me!

346
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Save me!

347
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Xiao Xue!

348
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Xiao Xue!

349
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Xiao Xue!

350
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Xiao Xue!

351
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
Girl!

352
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Shadow Spell!

353
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,640
A

354
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
