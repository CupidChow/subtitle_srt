00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:25,050


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,864
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,424
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,828
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,504
   

19
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,904
   

20
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:08,639
Ever since Qi was born, we have always prevented her from meeting with Zhu Yu.

21
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,880
Now that they've reunited,

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,499
I'm afraid the situation will be unfavorable.

23
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:16,299
It was my fault.

24
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:22,819
I never thought that Lin Yuan would come to Wuyan Village.

25
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,340
The Sea of Clear Skies is also aware that we're collecting Dragon Crystals.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,259
They've probably already guessed we'd use those crystals against them.

27
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,819
That's not a problem.

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,939
After all these years, haven't we always been on guard against them,

29
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,039
and testing each other?

30
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,499
Actually, what I'm more worried about is

31
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:47,480
that they might tell Yue Jinzhao about his origins.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,530
I believe Zhu Yu will keep her word before

33
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,440
finding a safe method to rescue the Yu Clan.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,280
She won't tell Yue Jinzhao the truth.

35
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,299
But Yue Jinzhao already knows that he resembles Third Brother.

36
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,519
Moreover, he can find us by following the Qiyuan Sect.

37
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,240
We're not ready yet.

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,359
Then we'll speed everything up and deal with the Qiyuan Sect.

39
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,120
After all, we have enough Qiyuan Orbs.

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,399
Your wound hasn't healed yet. What are you doing here?

41
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,340
It was my mistake before, that Jinzhao knocked off my mask.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,059
I'm to blame. I'll find a solution to fix this.

43
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:28,520
There's no use talking about it now.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,079
Not long ago, I just used the Righteous Martial Alliance

45
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,179
to eliminate the Jiangning branch of the Qiyuan Sect.

46
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,500
The sect leader is dead.

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
I want to write to Gao Xiao about it and let him succeed as sect leader.

48
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,100
I'll be responsible for the affairs of the Qiyuan Sect from now on.

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,259
Eldest Brother, I've always been in charge of the Qiyuan Sect.

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,299
You continue to watch over the Sea of Clear Skies.

51
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,100
If Zhu Yu forcibly keeps Qi, we must step in and stop it.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,520
Third Brother, don't overthink it.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,539
You're seriously injured. He hopes that you can rest well.

54
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:17,960
Second Sister, I understand.

55
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,460
He's afraid I'll...

56
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,359
do things outside our plan again.

57
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:26,960
Well, he is worried about you.

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,199
I think it makes sense.

59
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,732
 Ling Ye? 

60
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,400
 Why is Zhu Yu called Ling Ye now? 

61
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,500
Qi. You're here.

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,899
Zhu Yu.

63
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,719
Does the Yu Clan have many spells?

64
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,420
Yes.

65
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,860
Can you teach me?

66
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,559
You are my daughter.

67
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,660
As long as you want to learn, I will certainly teach you all I know.

68
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,279
Really?

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,800
Can you teach me how to lift the Companion Life Spell?

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,179
Jinzhao lost most of his memories because of me.

71
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:42,199
I feel very guilty.

72
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,719
The Companion Life Spell?

73
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:51,760
Is it because it's a secret of the Yu Clan,

74
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,140
so you're unwilling to teach me?

75
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,240
Of course not.

76
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,780
As long as you want, I can do anything for you.

77
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,559
- Then, I... 
 - It is getting late today.

78
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,180
You should go to bed.

79
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,319
I'll teach you another day. Okay?

80
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,659
What? Are you afraid I'll kill myself?

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,240
Today, enjoy the wine and forget. Worry about tomorrow's worries tomorrow.

82
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,900
Young Jinzhao, let's drink.

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,820
Here.

84
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,759
Such beautiful scenery is worth a drink.

85
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,259
Here.

86
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,559
Qi has always liked water. I always said she was like a fish.

87
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:24,060
Surprisingly, I was right.

88
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,640
So she's a Kun.

89
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,480
Her thoughts are always different.

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,331
Scales would grow on her body.

91
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:36,451
Now it all makes sense.

92
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:40,780
Forget Kuns. Forget humans.

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,780
Here. A toast to Qi for finding her origins.

94
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,880
Jinzhao, are you okay?

95
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,719
What could be wrong with me?

96
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,839
Qi has found her origins.

97
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,340
I'm so happy for her.

98
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,760
Humans can be quite interesting.

99
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Four words describe you now, forcing yourself to smile.

100
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,700
I'm just fine. I'm not forcing anything.

101
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,619
Yeah, right.

102
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:33,379
Today, we know Young Yue is a young lord of the Yu Clan.

103
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,880
Yet you're a guy without memories.

104
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,500
You must feel sad.

105
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,619
Indeed, I am.

106
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:47,940
Then... do you blame Young Yue?

107
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,781
How could I?

108
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
I'm just sad.

109
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,260
The one who's been with Qi for three years.

110
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,480
Is that me?

111
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,500
Is it really Yue Jinzhao?

112
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:12,159
The desire to be with Qi and protect her.

113
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,340
Does it belong to Yue Jinzhao?

114
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,220
Is Qi dependent on me...

115
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:23,660
because of Yue Jinzhao?

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,439
Young Jinzhao, in my opinion,

117
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:33,820
you're asking for needless worries.

118
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,699
Yes.

119
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,139
No past and no memories.

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,780
The only thing certain...

121
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,959
the past three years is that I'm Yue Jinzhao.

122
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,279
But now,

123
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,739
I can't even be sure of that anymore.

124
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,492
Think about the positive.

125
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,519
You've always been looking for your past.

126
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,780
Either way, you've found it.

127
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,459
Yes.

128
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,419
You're right.

129
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,820
Qi has finally found her family.

130
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,080
I should be happy for her.

131
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,019
Jinzhao.

132
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,440
- Jinzhao. 
 - And you.

133
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,100
Since you like someone, you must let her know your feelings.

134
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I...

135
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,860
I'll give it a try.

136
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,759
I will.

137
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,740
I made it through again this time.

138
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,300
Xian Qing.

139
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,439
Come.

140
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,819
- Thank you. 
 - Feel better?

141
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm fine. I just need to get through this moment.

142
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,499
Zhaoyan,

143
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,559
twins in the Luo family die young.

144
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,579
Do you know why?

145
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,559
Could you please stop asking?

146
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,860
I don't want to lie to you.

147
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,079
Never mind.

148
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,760
If you don't want to, then don't.

149
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,620
Xian Qing, don't worry about me.

150
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,860
I'm already used to it.

151
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,139
But even if you don't love yourself,

152
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,139
think about the people around you, who love you.

153
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:34,180
They'll feel bad.

154
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,939
- I won't let them know. 
 - But I already know.

155
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,440
It pains me.

156
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,999
Xian Qing, you must be kidding.

157
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,459
Miss Shuo Xuan.

158
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,740
Where are you?

159
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,710
Shuo...

160
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,080
Forget it, maybe next time.

161
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,980
 Since you like someone, you must let her know your feelings. 

162
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,860
Miss Shuo Xuan.

163
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,880
Why is it you again? Why are you following me?

164
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,772
I...

165
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,780
I... Well...

166
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,320
I...

167
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,980
I...

168
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,740
Well...

169
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,759
You like me?

170
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:18,459
Well... well... I just came from over there and saw you.

171
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,819
We admire heroes and warriors.

172
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,119
You're a coward who can't even defeat me.

173
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,939
I'm already... stronger than before.

174
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:38,939
All right then. Let's fight a round.

175
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,819
If you win, I'll allow you to fall for me.

176
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:47,019
But if you lose, you stay out of my sight.

177
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,300
- This... 
 - Fight or not?

178
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,440
Fight.

179
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,119
Zhaoyan.

180
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,420
Do you really not know? Or are you pretending not to know?

181
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:11,699
Do you know what you are talking about?

182
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,640
I do.

183
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,980
You said that we were friends. But I don't want us to be just friends.

184
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,420
I also don't just want to be your confidant.

185
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,260
The hairpin I gave you represents my feelings for you.

186
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,959
Zhaoyan, you clearly have feelings for me too. Why keep avoiding it?

187
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:49,020
I am a human with a short life.

188
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,039
I don't care about that.

189
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,059
I'm only asking you,

190
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:57,079
are you willing to be with me?

191
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,388
♫  A preface to the sorrowful wind, snow falls, parting us  ♫

192
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:07,414
♫  Unable to bear to see your tears flowing  ♫

193
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:12,704
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

194
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:18,260
♫  Instead why not take my doomed fate away  ♫

195
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,510
♫  The mirror reflects the shadows but remains invisible  ♫

196
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,019
Miss Luo might be looking for you.

197
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,519
Sorry.

198
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,700
It's all right.

199
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,795
You should rest well.

200
00:16:30,795 --> 00:16:32,804
♫  Using the lightest words  ♫

201
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:35,144
♫  To make the harshest decisions  ♫

202
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:40,540
♫  No different from a death sentence  ♫

203
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,324
Zhaoyan, I will wait for an answer.

204
00:16:44,324 --> 00:16:49,960
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

205
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,605
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

206
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:58,016
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain,  ♫

207
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:02,084
♫  don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

208
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:07,398
♫  Humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

209
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:14,960
♫  In the dream, humming that tune  ♫

210
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,084
♫  of lovesickness  ♫

211
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:29,719
You lost.

212
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:35,080
I... I'm not strong enough now.

213
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
But I will become stronger eventually.

214
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,359
One day, I will become a great hero, a person of great importance.

215
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,760
So...

216
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,799
- So now... 
 - You're indeed quite interesting.

217
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,939
Then, Miss Shuo Xuan, what kind of things do you like?

218
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,340
The Sea of Clear Skies and Her Lordship.

219
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,520
Are they the same?

220
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,359
Her Lordship is the Sea of Clear Skies.

221
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,019
The Sea of Clear Skies is Her Lordship.

222
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,540
Do you like anything else?

223
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
I also like little fish.

224
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,039
I like fish, too.

225
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,379
I mean it. They taste good baked or fried.

226
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:17,860
Get lost!

227
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,899
Sorry. No, no, Miss Shuo Xuan. That's not what I meant!

228
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:28,980
I'm sorry, Miss Shuo Xuan! I...

229
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,840
I messed it up again.

230
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,840
Zhaoyan,

231
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,699
take care of yourself.

232
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:43,239
 Maiming, you too. 

233
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,100
The Sea of Clear Skies and the young lord of the Yu Clan.

234
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:12,360
The young lord of the Yu Clan could be Bian Luohuan's disciple.

235
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,400
Cang Feng. Things really are getting more interesting.

236
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,251
You love the fun, don't you?

237
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,679
I stay here and never leave.

238
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,400
How could I give up a chance to see the show?

239
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,470
Since Yue Qi is a Kun, it makes sense why

240
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,340
she could cause the Rehai key ring to react.

241
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,919
Why?

242
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,779
The key rings are made from divine objects.

243
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:48,779
The power of Nine Springs resonates with each other.

244
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,459
The Rehai key ring is made from a dragon's horn.

245
00:19:55,459 --> 00:20:00,439
The Mist Soul key ring is made from the scales of a Kun.

246
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:06,640
So, if Yue Qi can cause Rehai to react,

247
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,779
it's not surprising at all.

248
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,440
I see.

249
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:28,439
Seems Zhaoyan is really... having a good time out there.

250
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,340
The colorful world has enchanted her.

251
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:54,140
The young girl has finally grown up.

252
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,019
Zhu Yu, as we agreed yesterday, shouldn't you teach me how to undo the Companion Life Spell?

253
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:13,639
No, no.

254
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,779
The moment I mentioned it yesterday, Zhu Yu tried to avoid it.

255
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,479
What should I do?

256
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,599
Why is Jinzhao here?

257
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,599
You want Qi to stay in the Sea of Clear Skies?

258
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,039
Qi has wandered with me for three years.

259
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,779
She has suffered a lot.

260
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:34,779
She deserves to return to her world.

261
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,159
But you can't decide for her.

262
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,659
Actually, I'd thought about taking Qi away.

263
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,140
But it wasn't easy for her to find her origins.

264
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,319
Everyone here will respect and care for her.

265
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:56,960
I can't take away everything that belongs to her because of my selfishness.

266
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,279
But she's willing to go with you.

267
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,020
You're the most important person to her.

268
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,080
I taught Qi everything I know.

269
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,080
The reason she wants to go with me

270
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,220
is that I was the only one she had in the past three years.

271
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,899
It's not like that.

272
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,839
You're determined to leave...

273
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,459
because of the Companion Life Spell.

274
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,079
 Qi is using the Resonance Spell. 

275
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,379
 Qi. 

276
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
Qi!

277
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,679
Qi!

278
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,459
Qi.

279
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,660
Jinzhao, I don't want the Companion Life Spell.

280
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,056
Neither do you.

281
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,160
Jinzhao!

282
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,719
Qi.

283
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,832
♫  A butterfly drifts along ones fingertips, yet no one notices  ♫

284
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,560
- Jinzhao, I don't want this spell. 
 - Qi.

285
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,060
I don't want this spell!

286
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,020
Qi.

287
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:48,700
♫  In this lifetime, I will only ever care for one person  ♫

288
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,099
Why did you do this?

289
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:58,449
♫  Afraid of the vast ocean, of the changing fields  ♫

290
00:24:58,449 --> 00:25:02,560
♫  Afraid of not being able to say goodbye  ♫

291
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,180
♫  Afraid there's only longing left in the memories  ♫

292
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,379
Now...

293
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:16,444
♫  Afraid of dreams, of parting  ♫

294
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:19,540
...are you going to abandon me?

295
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:25,092
♫  Afraid we'll lose each other forever in one moment  ♫

296
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:33,088
♫  Afraid after reincarnation we'll search everywhere yet pass by each other  ♫

297
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,379
Jinzhao,

298
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,820
do you really want to leave me here?

299
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,199
Qi, do you remember?

300
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:15,079
When we were at Jing'an, you asked me

301
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,200
what a mother was.

302
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,539
I know your longing for a mother.

303
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,940
So even if I'm by your side,

304
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,080
I cannot replace your mother, Zhu Yu.

305
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,620
But I don't want to be separated from you.

306
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,100
In the beginning, you may not be used to it.

307
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,500
But gradually, you will.

308
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:01,059
How could I?

309
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,779
You will.

310
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:07,900
Just like the jade pendant that you used to have, can be dropped inadvertently.

311
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,120
Jinzhao, wait here for me. I'll go retrieve the jade pendant.

312
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,879
Wait for me.

313
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,639
 Miss Yue is innocent, but she's not foolish. 

314
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:30,140
 One day she'll understand that in her world, 

315
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,860
 it's not just the two of you. 

316
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,060
 Over protection is inappropriate. 

317
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,939
 Goodbye. 

318
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,619
 Qi. 

319
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
Where is it?

320
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,299
I finally found it.

321
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,100
Yue Jinzhao has left.

322
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,379
He left by the Yunlai Stone.

323
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,280
This is what he left behind.

324
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,500
 Inside this, 

325
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,180
 I've written about some things Qi likes. 

326
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,340
 It's... what I've learned by taking care of her the past three years. 

327
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,356
 Rest assured, 

328
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,299
 I will take care of Qi, just like you did. 

329
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
 Qi loves food. 

330
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,260
 She's rarely a picky eater. 

331
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,200
 Her favorite is egg noodles and Jing'an pastries. 

332
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
 As we mentioned last time... 

333
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,179
 She likes hearing and reading stories. 

334
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,779
 Especially storytellers talking about love. 

335
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:13,140
 Whenever she encounters a storyteller, I can never pull her away. 

336
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,980
 A shock through the heavens. 

337
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,759
 Lightning flashed and thunder roared. 

338
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,620
 Finally breaking from the shackles 

339
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,860
 and soaring into the sky. 

340
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:26,979
 And a legend unfolds. 

341
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,140
 Apart from good food, 

342
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,160
 she is not particular about clothes or accommodations. 

343
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,644
 However, she will have a better life in the future. 

344
00:30:37,644 --> 00:30:43,376
♫  We're like two ends of a story  ♫

345
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,864
♫  Separated by an ocean  ♫

346
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,179
 Qi is very clever, 

347
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:55,804
 but sometimes she's a bit slow regarding human relations. 

348
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:57,904
 She needs to be taught slowly. 

349
00:30:57,904 --> 00:31:02,812
♫  Watching time flow backwards, gradually moving further away  ♫

350
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:06,100
♫  The unfamiliar conversation  ♫

351
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,039
 Also... 

352
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,759
 Qi is a young lord, 

353
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,879
 but don't impose many rules and restrictions on her. 

354
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,919
 She does not like that. 

355
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,180
 What she needs is a carefree life. 

356
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,122
♫  Can't escape the memories, it's so hard to endure he longing  ♫

357
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,288
♫  Yet you're still not here  ♫

358

♫  Watching time flow backwards, gradually moving further away  ♫

359
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:34,288
♫  The unfamiliar conversation  ♫

360
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:39,920
♫  If only time would stop for me, at the crossroads of parting  ♫

361
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,500
 Jinzhao, I must find the way to lift the Companion Life Spell. 

362
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:54,843
♫  This time, I'll be the one to first turn back  ♫

363
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,340
Young Yue is gone. What are you planning to do next?

364
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,799
Now that Qi has found her family, I need to find mine.

365
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,440
I need to find Bian Luohuan.

366
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,539
I want to find out my origins

367
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,200
and eradicate the Qiyuan Sect to prevent them...

368
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,140
 There's footprints here. 

369
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,980
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

370
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,980
Nothing.

371
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,279
I suddenly thought of something.

372
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,012
Since we encountered Gao Xiao's demon beast by the Yinma River,

373
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:05,579
the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect might be nearby.

374
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,140
It makes sense.

375
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,600
If we want to eradicate the Qiyuan Sect, we may have to cooperate with the Righteous Martial Alliance.

376
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,699
But we've already fallen out with them.

377
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,380
I don't have to go.

378
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,099
Xian Qing.

379
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:25,260
Xian Qing, are you still mad at the sect leader?

380
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:30,640
I don't care about that at all, it's fleeting to me.

381
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,160
I've lived for over a thousand years, while Zuo Guanren is barely over fifty.

382
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,260
How could I possibly quibble with my junior over such trivial things?

383
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,559
I've also lived as I please for a thousand years.

384
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,840
I've traveled a lot with you.

385
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,479
I'm getting tired.

386
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,459
Uncle, you can go back to Mount Yuqing to rest then.

387
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,919
Will you come back and join us again?

388
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,300
Did you follow me because you have something to tell me?

389
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,779
I know you left to facilitate the cooperation with the Righteous Martial Alliance.

390
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:39,990
You know me best.

391
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,620
However...

392
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,020
I thought you came to give me an answer.

393
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,799
I...

394
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,179
I...

395
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,860
Never mind. I have a journey ahead.

396
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,579
I'll be going now.

397
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:12,620
I want...

398
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,652
want...

399
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,880
- What do you want? 
 - I want...

400
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:30,540
I want you to join us again. I also want to be with you.

401
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:36,040
Farewell.

402
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,739
Farewell.

403
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,620
Your Lordship.

404
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,599
How is the young lord?

405
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,299
Qi is fine.

406
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,488
But just now,

407
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,840
I saw her cry.

408
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,680
Cry?

409
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,299
She's your child.

410
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,259
How could a Kun cry?

411
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:29,140
Right, how could a Kun cry?

412
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,572
I'm still a Kun.

413
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:38,100
But my daughter is becoming more like a human.

414
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,779
She must have traveled in the Mortal Realm for too long.

415
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,979
She's assimilated to being human.

416
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:47,059
This can't go on anymore.

417
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,840
Your Lordship, why not take this opportunity

418
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,499
to keep the young lord by your side in the Sea of Clear Skies?

419
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,419
Absolutely not.

420
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,140
Your Lordship.

421
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,879
If the young lord stays for a long time,

422
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:06,420
I fear it will break our agreement with the Hengdao Sect.

423
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:10,200
At worst, we'll fall out with them.

424
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,480
It's not yet time.

425
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,299
Your Lordship, one more thing.

426
00:39:23,299 --> 00:39:25,779
The Hengdao Sect is mining Dragon Crystals.

427
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:29,259
And Dragon Crystals can be used as energy for mechanisms.

428
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:32,940
I fear that they may be used against our people in the future.

429
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,040
It's not a concern.

430
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,660
The most important thing now is to find Rehai.

431
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,259
Yes.

432
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,159
With the life force of Rehai,

433
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,700
Your Lordship can heal us soon.

434
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:07,060
