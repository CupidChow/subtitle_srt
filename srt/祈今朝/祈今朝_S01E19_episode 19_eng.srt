00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:25,070


2
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,780
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,384
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,692
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,500
   

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,991
   

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,360
Why so hesitant? Hurry up.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,339
Qianjun, there is no rush.

22
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,824
The ground seems to be dug on both sides.

23
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,624
There might be a trap.

24
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,099
Let's discuss it first. Young Hero Yue, what do you say?

25
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,939
To the left.

26
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,139
Do as he says. To the left.

27
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,059
Old Xu, can we count on him?

28
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:36,880
Of course. Remember what he did at the Langyin Pavilion...

29
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,279
Move aside!

30
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,920
Sect leader! Bad news!

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,520
The Righteous Martial Alliance is breaking in from the front gate.

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,019
Our brothers have been badly injured!

33
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,220
 - Sect leader, bad news!  
 - What now?

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,079
Sect leader!

35
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,000
Sect leader! Someone broke in from the back door.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,100
How can you all be so useless?

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,199
Why are they causing trouble right now?

38
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,519
Hurry, stop them!

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,519
Jinzhao, are you okay?

40
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,219
I'm fine.

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,890
Brother Xu.

42
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,199
Brother Xu.

43
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,959
- Brother Xu. 
 - Old Xu!

44
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,659
Old Xu!

45
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,339
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,639
Can your apology bring them back to life?

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,600
To the left? Why the left?!

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,340
- It's not the time to be impulsive. 
  - Bad news! 

49
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,620
 Brother Chen, the Qiyuan Sect's disciples are coming! 

50
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,720
It's urgent. Consider yourself lucky!

51
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,080
Yue Jinzhao, calm down.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,319
Let's think about what we should do next.

53
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,759
They noticed us.

54
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,140
We should split up.

55
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,879
One group should get Gao Xiao.

56
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,300
The other should stall the guards.

57
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,919
Yue Jinzhao, I see what you're trying to do.

58
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,979
You just want us to die and buy you time.

59
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,879
I'll go with you.

60
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,699
Yes, we'll go with you.

61
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,380
Me too.

62
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,680
Go with Miss Yue to get Gao Xiao.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
Yue Jinzhao, remember.

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,440
All our casualties and the bloodshed are on you!

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,180
Let's go!

66
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
Be careful.

67
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,579
Let's go.

68
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,640
Jinzhao, Uncle Gu told us before we took off that it'd be risky.

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,399
Jinzhao, Uncle Gu told us before we took off that it'd be risky.

70
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,699
But we came, anyway.

71
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:06,480
In that case, we must save even more people. Right?

72
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,499
Yes.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,586
It's you two making trouble here again.

74
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:47,247
Aren't you a bit too bold?

75
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,879
You've done too much evil.

76
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,120
Today, I'll finish you off.

77
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,040
In the territory of my Qiyuan Sect,

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,879
how dare you talk nonsense on my turf!

79
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,899
Now, I will let you know what it means to go and never come back.

80
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,599
Now, I will let you know what it means to go and never come back.

81
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Jinzhao, these disciples look crazy.

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,880
It's because of the Qiyuan Orb. Gao Xiao!

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,200
Thank you, Lord Ming.

84
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,160
Jinzhao, let me try. I can save them.

85
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,279
Stall them.

86
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,550
 Save us, Lord Ming. 

87
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
 Help me. 

88
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,499
Thank you, Lord Ming!

89
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,600
 Thank you, Lord Ming. Thank you, Lord Ming. 

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,520
Qi, no. If you keep going, you'll...

91
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,780
I won't die. We can't let the Qiyuan Sect do this to them.

92
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,700
 Thank you, Lord Ming. 

93
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,800
Why did you catalyze so many Qiyuan Orbs?

94
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,900
You still came, after all.

95
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Why did you do that?

96
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,100
Qi has consumed Qiyuan Orbs twice before.

97
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,700
She wasn't demonized.

98
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
Instead, she gained power.

99
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:33,100
It's her chance to consume more Qiyuan Orbs and activate the power of a mythical beast.

100
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,400
How can I let it go?

101
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Third Brother. Third Brother.

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,000
Qi!

103
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,200
Qi!

104
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:01,200
Jinzhao, it hurts!

105
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,000
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

106
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,600
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,100
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

108
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
The Qiyuan Orbs contain dark feelings of dying people.

109
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,200
Aren't you afraid Qi might get overwhelmed and lose consciousness?

110
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,400
I never do anything uncertain.

111
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
- What are you doing? 
 - Saving her.

112
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Third Brother!

113
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,600
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

114
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,100
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

115
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,500
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

116
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,000
♫  Following your silhouette across thousands of miles  ♫

117
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,700
 Bian Luohuan. He can resonate with Qi. 

118
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:09,000
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,800
♫  My heart can't help but draw closer to you  ♫

120
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,100
♫  Seeking a perfect ending  ♫

121
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,700
Third Brother!

122
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,400
♫  How do I calm it?  ♫

123
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,500
♫  I've done my best  ♫

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,600
You saw it just now.

125
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
The Resonance Spell between Yue Jinzhao and Qi

126
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
has already surpassed yours.

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Isn't this what we wanted?

128
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,700
♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

129
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,470
♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

130
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,900
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

131
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
 Qi, hurry. Wake up. 

132
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
 Our friends are still fighting the enemy. 

133
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,300
 We still need to fight alongside them. 

134
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,200
 Hurry, wake up! 

135
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,500
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

136
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,220
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

137
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,600
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

138
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,200
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

139
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

140
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,600
They've broken in!

141
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,800
- Run! 
 - Run!

142
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,000
Qi!

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Qi!

144
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,400
It's Young Yue?

145
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,200
Miss Yue made that sound?

146
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,900
Jinzhao, we did it.

147
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,800
We did it. We did it.

148
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
Miss Yue.

149
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,900
- She's fine. 
  - That's our Lord Ming! 

150
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,800
 - Lord Ming is amazing! 
 - It's Lord Ming! 

151
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,100
 - That's our Lord Ming! 
 - It's Lord Ming! 

152
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,500
It really is Lord Ming!

153
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,600
- She's Lord Ming! 
 - She's Lord Ming!

154
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,200
Is Miss Yue really Lord Ming?

155
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
She's not Lord Ming!

156
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,700
It doesn't matter. Capture her first.

157
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,300
- Protect Lord Ming! 
 - Protect Lord Ming.

158
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,700
Leader Zuo, Miss Yue is the young lord of the Yu Clan and the descendant of Kun.

159
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,200
She isn't Lord Ming.

160
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,900
Besides, she's never done anything wrong.

161
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,200
Yeah, Leader. I've visited the Yu Clan, too.

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
Everyone, as the leader of the Righteous Martial Alliance,

163
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
there are some things I have to do.

164
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,100
- Arrest her! 
 - Brother Guanren.

165
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,400
I understand why you're doing this.

166
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
But I have to stand against you.

167
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,800
If she's Lord Ming,

168
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,700
then why is she helping you destroy the Qiyuan Sect?

169
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,400
Bian Luohuan.

170
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
Who are you?

171
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Leader Zuo, calm down.

172
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
Third Brother.

173
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
Lord Shengxuan, why are you doing this?

174
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Minister Gao.

175
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
You've dedicated yourself to the Qiyuan Sect for years.

176
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,700
Today, I'm going to reward you handsomely.

177
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,400
No, no!

178
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
Lord Shengxuan, please spare my life.

179
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,400
Spare me.

180
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,200
I... I don't want to ascend, Lord Shengxuan.

181
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,900
I can't ascend!

182
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,500
I can't die, Lord Shengxuan!

183
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,800
Help me. Save me.

184
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Why are you stepping back?

185
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Why?!

186
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
You bunch of... bunch of fools!

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,900
You... You think these people in power are nice and kind?

188
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,300
The Qiyuan Orbs that you crave are feeding on your lives!

189
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,000
The Qiyuan Orbs that you crave are feeding on your lives!

190
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
You don't even know that you've been tricked.

191
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,800
Stepping back?

192
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,500
You're all going to die.

193
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,000
All of you are going to die!

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
You, you,

195
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,800
and all the slaves are all food for Lord Ming!

196
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
You're all gong to die!

197
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Lord Shengxuan.

198
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,400
Lord Shengxuan! I won't accept this!

199
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,500
I...

200
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,000
This...

201
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,600
What happened?

202
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,000
Everyone, you all saw it.

203
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,200
The so-called ascension is death.

204
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,700
You were driven by your desire to blindly seek ascension.

205
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,600
You don't even know the truth about Lord Ming.

206
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
But you go crazy over some illusory thing

207
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,300
and turn your kindred against each other.

208
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,500
It really is ridiculous.

209
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,400
Remember my name.

210
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,300
Ying Xuwei.

211
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,800
The Qiyuan Sect is a gift from our Hengdao Sect.

212
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,500
I believe we'll see each other again soon.

213
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,500
Third Brother, let's go.

214
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Bian Luohuan!

215
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,300
Who are you exactly?

216
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,300
Yue Jinzhao, you'll find out when the time is right.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It won't take long.

218
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
It's fake!

219
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,600
Everything's fake!

220
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,700
What Lord Ming?

221
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,160
Ascension?! It's all utter nonsense!

222
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
The self-destruction device is already on!

223
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,000
This place is going to collapse soon!

224
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
Let's die together!

225
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,700
Die together!

226
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,739
Die together!

227
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,760
It's collapsing! Everyone, to the exits. Hurry.

228
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
It's too late.

229
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,300
You go first. I'll shut down the device.

230
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Master!

231
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,400
 Hurry up. Get out of here! 

232
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,200
- Hurry up. 
 - Let's go.

233
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,100
 - Run! 
 - Hurry up! 

234
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,960
 Hurry, let's go! 

235
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,500
   

236
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Why did you come?

237
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,300
It's... It's too dangerous here.

238
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,000
This place is deadly.

239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,200
It may collapse the mountain at any time.

240
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Stay put, don't move.

241
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Ju Shifang, can you send Dou Bao to do it?

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Ju Shifang, hurry up or we'll die here!

243
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
I...

244
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,400
No. I can't let Dou Bao do it.

245
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,600
 I swear I'll protect Dou Bao. 

246
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:20,060
 This is the only thing my mother left me. 

247
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,600
 I saw a huge casualty of the Righteous Martial Alliance at Pureness. 

248
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,300
 If I don't stop it, I'm afraid... 

249
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Stay put, don't move.

250
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
- Master! 
 - Senior Gu!

251
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
You can't!

252
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Stay back!

253
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,100
 What happened three years ago... 

254
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 has come around today. 

255
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,400
Senior Gu!

256
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
Don't! Don't go!

257
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,300
- Miss Ming. 
 - Don't go!

258
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,200
- Let go of me! 
 - You can't!

259
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,100
Miss Ming!

260
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,000
I said let go of me.

261
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,599
Miss Ming!

262
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,900
- Wait here. 
 - Xian Qing!

263
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,500
Master, you finally woke up.

264
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,099
Young Xiu'er, stop crying.

265
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:01,700
I'm fine.

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,300
How are you feeling right now?

267
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,060
I feel...

268
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,020
a bit hungry.

269
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Xiu'er, can you find me something to eat?

270
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You rarely leave Mount Yuqing.

271
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,700
Did you leave this time because you saw something at Pureness?

272
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,400
Right before Young Xiu'er's birthday, my key ring glowed.

273
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Do you remember?

274
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,110
 I need to go to Pureness. 

275
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
So I decided to go to Pureness.

276
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,200
And I saw the future there.

277
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Pureness showed...

278
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,800
that the attack on the Qiyuan Sect's headquarters

279
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,700
would take a heavy toll on the Righteous Martial Alliance.

280
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:33,379
How can I sit back and let them...

281
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,200
die for the great cause?

282
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
So you chose to sacrifice yourself?

283
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,400
So you chose to sacrifice yourself?

284
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,900
It would be nice to change people's fate based on

285
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
what I saw at Pureness.

286
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,400
Xian Qing.

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,379
Do me a favor.

288
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,300
Can you lend me your demonic orb to extend my life for half a day?

289
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,900
Between us two,

290
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,400
do you even have to ask?

291
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
   

292
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Those guys got our buddies killed.

293
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,900
I'd be so ashamed if I were them.

294
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,600
I'd bury my head in the sand.

295
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
I heard Senior Gu was badly hurt. I wonder how he is now.

296
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Virtue has its reward. Senior Gu will be fine.

297
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,900
The Silver Shadow our leader gave him was a waste.

298
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
Senior, are you better?

299
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm fine.

300
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,800
Since you're here, come with me.

301
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
Senior, I...

302
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,600
Did I say you could turn me down?

303
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
Master, you just woke up.

304
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,600
Don't worry, Xiu'er.

305
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Young Xiu.

306
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,500
This is between them.

307
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,300
Hanjiang knows what he's doing.

308
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,800
Please look after Qi when she wakes up.

309
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,900
Don't worry. Zhaoyan will take care of her.

310
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,200
I'll keep an eye on her, too.

311
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,000
Madam Xu, please accept it.

312
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,540
This is...

313
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,100
Senior Gu, why are we here?

314
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,500
Madam Xu, just take it.

315
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,600
We'll bring you Brother Xu's wages every month from now on.

316
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,700
He's gone already. What wages?

317
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,000
I have to raise my child alone. But I can work.

318
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,700
We may live a poor life, but we'll get by.

319
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,500
My husband was a rough man and often did ridiculous things,

320
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,200
but he would never live on others' sympathy. Neither will we.

321
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,800
Madam Xu, you misunderstood. It's not like that.

322
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
Please forgive me.

323
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,559
The Righteous Martial Alliance is only lending you the money to meet urgent needs.

324
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,500
Once Zhengyun grows up, he can pay us back.

325
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Madam Xu, please just accept it.

326
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,300
Madam Xu.

327
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,859
Thank you.

328
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,260
Zhengyun, your father was a great man.

329
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,180
Protect your mother well from now on.

330
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
I will.

331
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,200
Madam Xu, we'll take our leave now.

332
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,800
Mother,

333
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,200
I'll be a hero once I grow up and bring you gifts, too.

334
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Good boy.

335
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,000
You can be a scholar or a businessman, but not a fighter.

336
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,700
We'll stay away from the martial arts world.

337
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,200
If your father were alive, he would want you to be safe.

338
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,500
Later find a good girl and marry her.

339
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
We'll live a peaceful life together.

340
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,000
It's no good being a hero.

341
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,200
But Father was a hero.

342
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,200
But then you wouldn't be able to see me anymore.

343
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
Do you still want to be a hero then?

344
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,800
Mother, will I never see Father again?

345
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,000
Mother, I miss Father.

346
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,400
I want Father.

347
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,800
I miss Father.

348
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Don't turn away.

349
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,900
Remember everything about this moment,

350
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,000
don't ever forget it.

351
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,100
Mother, I want Father. I miss him.

352
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,500
Be good. You're a tough boy.

353
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,900
Tough boys don't cry.

354
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,900
Mother, I'm a tough boy.

355
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,900
I'll grow up soon and protect you for Father.

356
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,500
Xu Qiming, you jerk.

357
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,400
You said on our wedding day that we would grow old together.

358
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,400
But you went and died.

359
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,300
I shouldn't have married you.

360
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,300
Let's go.

361
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Senior,

362
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,300
why did you show us that?

363
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Then tell me,

364
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,900
why were you so upset this morning?

365
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
I...

366
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,120
I was scared.

367
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,499
I was scared that I'd be called a murderer and condemned.

368
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:05,100
I was scared... I would be hated.

369
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,600
I was scared, too.

370
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,100
And now?

371
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,800
I'm still scared.

372
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,600
They were all once alive.

373
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,500
They had friends and families,

374
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,400
but they died because of me.

375
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,259
It's my fault.

376
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,400
My fault.

377
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:30,408
I was overly confident...

378
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,000
and caused people to lose their family members.

379
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,000
I got so many people killed,

380
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,700
but I don't dare face it.

381
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,500
I was so selfish and almost got you killed.

382
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,100
I was so selfish and almost got you killed.

383
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
What scares me the most is that I'm a coward.

384
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,400
Such a coward will never become a hero.

385
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
Get up.

386
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,900
Get up!

387
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Leave me alone!

388
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,600
What right do you have to cry?

389
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,700
- I said what right do you have to cry? 
 - Why can't I cry?

390
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,300
Who says guys can't cry?!

391
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,400
You pushed me?

392
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
Yue Jinzhao, you pushed me!

393
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,100
Are you done crying yet?!

394
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,600
You think you're the only one upset?

395
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,399
Don't belittle yourself.

396
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,799
You've done pretty well already.

397
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,800
I'm sorry, Jinzhao.

398
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,000
But I want to do better.

399
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,200
I will never forget what happened.

400
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,120
I won't either.

401
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Are you two done fighting?

402
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,400
It looks like you've realized

403
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,800
that you can't undo your mistakes

404
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,700
but you can make amends.

405
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Only if we don't fear the past, can we face the future unafraid.

406
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,200
Senior Gu,

407
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,600
you said before that sometimes the guardians of Pureness can see fragments of the future.

408
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,500
Then...

409
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,100
Do you believe in what you've seen?

410
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,600
Yes, I do.

411
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,600
But I've also said that the future can be changed.

412
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,000
Even if the future is a mess, you have Miss Yue by your side.

413
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,300
Take this coin as a token.

414
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,000
Don't forget what I said today.

415
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,300
Brother Ju, don't feel guilty either.

416
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,500
We all have different things we want to protect.

417
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,600
I made my choice and I'll naturally bear the consequences.

418
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
All right. Head back now.

419
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,979
Thank you, Senior Gu.

420
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,739
Qi.

421
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:30,979
Qi?

422
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,900
Why are you completely covered?

423
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,500
Don't cover your head when sleeping.

424
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,820
Qi?

425
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,900
Qi!

426
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,180
Jinzhao.

427
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,400
Did I scare you?

428
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,500
You looked upset lately,

429
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,000
so I wanted to cheer you up.

430
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,300
What's wrong?

431
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,200
Nothing.

432
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
I just wanted to hug you.

433
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,300
Qi.

434
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,600
I hope you'll always be by my side and stay with me forever.

435
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,100
Jinzhao, I'll always be with you.

436
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:21,010
