00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Qing

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hope you will always be by my side

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Always be with me

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jinzhao, I will always be with you

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Qing

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Qing

11
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Qing

12
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Boss

13
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You said I didn't hit the wall and didn't look back

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is it funny?

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Originally, you were going to break the common sense of Qi and me

16
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But sometimes I will be

17
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you for letting me go again

18
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, I just want you to see clearly

19
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yue Jinzhao's confession has surpassed you

20
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, thirteen years is no more than three years

21
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He is indeed talented

22
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I should also be happy for him, right?

23
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Boss, you can't drink alcohol

24
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Boss, come

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come

26
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Boss, I will try my best to stabilize your current situation

27
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Inner organs are corrupt and have no medicine to be taken

28
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How long can I delay?

29
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How long?

30
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Less than a year

31
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One year is enough

32
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The blood vessels have been destroyed

33
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then the sea of ​​the sky must be resolved in a year

34
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Among Confucius and Chinese literature

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Road to Rel gag

36
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Lady Yue seems to have an extra appetite today

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know why

38
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Recently, I can't eat enough

39
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You haven't been full

40
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,240
Did Xiao Yue consume too much

42
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
in the general meeting yesterday?

43
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,560
It makes sense.

44
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,680
But why did so many soul fish

45
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
appear suddenly in the general meeting yesterday?

46
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:29,340
It should be related to the

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,960
time when Miss Yue consumed so many Qi Yuan Pearls.

48
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
The General Meeting was held once,

49
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
and the General Meeting was held twice.

50
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,960
But Miss Yue was

51
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,360
tricked twice.

52
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,480
That's too much.

53
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
But I always feel that

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
every time I consume Qi Yuan Pearls,

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
my power will be stronger.

56
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
And

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
it's more delicious.

58
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,040
I should stop trying.

59
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,900
Can you finish talking once

60
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,920
unching�

61
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,560
Hat Get

62
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,160
What's wrong

63
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,040
What happened today

64
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,200
I want to apologize to you all

65
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
When the disciples of Qiyuan Sect were recruited,

66
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
they sent many disciples to Qiyuan Sect.

67
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
The problem of Qiyuan Sect is still not solved.

68
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,080
If the Hengdao Bell doesn't solve it in one day,

69
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,680
the people will be in trouble.

70
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Yes.

71
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,880
The priority now is to find the whereabouts of the Hengdao Bell.

72
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
I came here

73
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,880
to lead the Young Warriors to the front line

74
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,680
and fight against the Hengdao Bell together.

75
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
Chief, don't worry.

76
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
We are still investigating.

77
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
If there is a clue of the Hengdao Bell,

78
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
we will definitely communicate with the Zhenwu Alliance.

79
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,080
Thank you for your hard work.

80
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,480
Goodbye.

81
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I'll go see Chief off.

82
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
Chief.

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,080
Young Master Yue.

84
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,680
Please select another candidate to inherit the Silver Silver Silver.

85
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,680
Young Master Yue still remembers the day of the sword gift.

86
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
The aura of the sword that everyone saw.

87
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,880
In fact,

88
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
he chose you.

89
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,880
I have lived for tens of years.

90
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,280
I have never seen anyone wrong.

91
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Jinzhao.

92
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Chief Zuo still gave you the sword?

93
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
Yes.

94
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Since you gave it to me,

95
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,280
you have to perform well and cheer up.

96
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Don't let everyone down.

97
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,680
I know, Chief Qi.

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
Please.

99
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,680
I have something to tell you.

100
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
When we were in the headquarters, I saw

101
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,280
that the Hengdao Bell has a connection with you.

102
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
The Hengdao Bell?

103
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,080
It can actually be connected with Qi Guangming?

104
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,080
And even Fuwen is the same.

105
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
It seems that if the Hengdao Bell

106
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
is related to our relationship,

107
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
then they must be related to the Sea of Heaven.

108
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,880
Jinzhao, when Uncle Gu is well,

109
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,080
let's go to the Sea of Heaven and ask him.

110
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,080
Okay.

111
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
Let's go.

112
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,680
It's the last minute.

113
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,480
Don't you want to leave Xiaoxiu?

114
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,080
Do you think

115
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,680
she doesn't know

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,680
that I have sacrificed half of my life for you?

117
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,280
I want to hear the voice of a thousand people,

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,680
but I'm afraid of the death of one person.

119
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,280
She is so stubborn.

120
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Are you worried that she will do something stupid?

121
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,680
I will look at her.

122
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,280
She is also my Xiaoxiu.

123
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
From now on,

124
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
I'll leave it to you.

125
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,280
Xianqing,

126
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
I have troubled you a lot these years.

127
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
Thank you.

128
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,080
Take care of yourself.

129
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,280
And,

130
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,880
don't miss out on the people

131
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
who are rare to meet and have a fate.

132
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,280
You're so sweet.

133
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,280
Let's go find Xiu'er.

134
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
She didn't come with you.

135
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
She must have hidden herself

136
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,080
and been sad.

137
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
I...

138
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Come with me.

139
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,280
Little girl, don't cry.

140
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,280
Xiu'er, don't cry.

141
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Little girl, where is your home?

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,880
Why are you here alone?

143
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm from the village of the mountain.

144
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,680
The village head sent me here.

145
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,680
He said I'm the bride of the mountain goddess.

146
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,880
The bride of the mountain goddess?

147
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,680
Mountain goddess...

148
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,880
Mountain goddess is the most powerful in the world.

149
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,880
She eats a lot of things

150
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
and often marries a bride.

151
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,680
If there's no food,

152
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,280
the bride

153
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,680
will go to the mountain to feed people.

154
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,280
Send the child to the demon's pond

155
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,680
to exchange for the village's safety?

156
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,480
Poor thing.

157
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,680
I don't want to be the bride of the mountain goddess.

158
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,280
I don't want to either.

159
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
Little girl,

160
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,480
let me take you home, okay?

161
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,880
Come.

162
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,480
I finally found Xiu'er.

163
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,680
Ah...

164
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,680
Ah...

165
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,680
Ah...

166
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,880
Master, it seems that you haven't

167
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
talked to Xiu'er for a long time.

168
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,480
When I adopted you,

169
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,880
you often hid and cried.

170
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,480
I had to continue every time.

171
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,080
Don't do this again.

172
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,280
When you're unhappy, tell your friends.

173
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,680
If you're not happy, there's still a risk.

174
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,880
I don't want to tell anyone.

175
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,480
Master, I only want you to be with me.

176
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,880
I don't want anyone else.

177
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,880
Silly Xiu'er,

178
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I have to leave earlier than you.

179
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,280
You're an old demon like Xianqing.

180
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
I don't want to.

181
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
Life and death are reincarnated.

182
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,880
There are life and death.

183
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,480
If I die,

184
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,480
how can I live?

185
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,480
The nine powers are for one person.

186
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,880
Maybe the current master is willing to give up or die.

187
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,280
Otherwise, he will never change his mind.

188
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,480
In the future, I will ask Xianqing to protect me.

189
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,080
Master, I want to take on the task of protecting you.

190
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,080
Xiu'er.

191
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,880
This is your demon ring. I won't give it to anyone else.

192
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,480
I don't want to lose it.

193
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,380
I can't.

194
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,480
Xiu'er, what and who is here to guard the Nine Power?

195
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,480
It's funny that you don't care.

196
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,680
I hate seeing things grand but they can't be transformed.

197
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,680
It's not because I have no reason to guard this.

198
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,500
still remain

199
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,520
now

200
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,920
I always tell you

201
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,660
that the future

202
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
must not be changed

203
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:27,920
Waifu unique

204
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,800
How can you

205
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,480
exchange your misfortune for others' happiness?

206
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,960
Sha Xiu'er,

207
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,880
you will understand it in the future.

208
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,720
But Master,

209
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,560
I hope that

210
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,160
you will never understand it.

211
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
I still remember the day I met you.

212
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,760
You cried so sadly.

213
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,440
I felt so sad.

214
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
I thought

215
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,600
I could never make you feel so sad again.

216
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,480
Xiu'er,

217
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,520
Master,

219
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,360
I...

220
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,000
I still made you feel sad.

221
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
You're blown away by the container blown by the wind

222
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,180
I can't bear to see you cry

223
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:50,180
I won't break our District

224
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,560
Master

225
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,440
Please let me go

226
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm drunk as ice

227
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,880
I'm drunk as the spring rain

228
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm drunk as the cold snow

229
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm drunk as the rain

230
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I'm drunk as the stars

231
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,600
If you're so willful

232
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,120
You're drunk as the wind

233
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,880
You're drunk as the wind

234
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm drunk

235
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:48,240
As if

236
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,840
This time

237
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,640
In the dream, we are in love

238
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:11,040
In the dream, we are in love

239
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

240
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

241
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,440
So, Mr. Gu took the bribe

242
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,240
to return the favor

243
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

244
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

245
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

246
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

247
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,940
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

248
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

249
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

250
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
No need to be sorry

251
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,840
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

252
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
For things that happened

253
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,040
because of me

254
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,640
Mr. Gu

255
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,040
For the sake of my life

256
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,240
I want to apologize por Serjue

257
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,880
Lin Xiu learning contacts

258
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,400
Lin Xiu

259
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,400
subsequent tentacles

260
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:02,020
Jiuquan, there is seed

261
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,660
Kui와 resides in steering

262
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,280
I'm doing Shenjun's pajamas.

263
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,920
I just need to put on a man's clothes.

264
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,680
When you look enough,

265
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,920
this is dispatch of deck.

266
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,280
Follow the old tradition

267
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:38,840
and choose a love that shall haveNo

268
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,160
standards of chastity.

269
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,040
And consider

270
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,040
yes or no.

271
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm going to die.

272
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
A personal life.

273
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
No one will ever look for me

274
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
and get angry with me.

275
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Zhao Yan,

276
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
you know,

277
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
for thousands of years,

278
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
I've been watching the world

279
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
and watching the laughter and the anger of the world.

280
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I've been praying for a long time

281
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
and I've been praying for three years.

282
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
I've been thinking that

283
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
three friends are the best thing in life.

284
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
If you want to cry,

285
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
don't cry.

286
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
You...

287
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
Do you think I want to cry?

288
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
I've been crying for thousands of years.

289
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,040
It's not a good thing to be a bridge.

290
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
It's because I said so.

291
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
If I had seen it before,

292
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I would have laughed at myself.

293
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
It's not you.

294
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Your tears just now didn't seem to be

295
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
very precious.

296
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
It's very precious.

297
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Boss,

298
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
what do you need to prepare for the family's funeral?

299
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,040
A pair of white bamboo for the road ahead.

300
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,040
A set of new clothes for the cold.

301
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,040
A basket of paper money to keep the wealth.

302
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
We all want it.

303
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Okay.

304
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Boss,

305
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
are these really useful?

306
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Miss,

307
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
these are the wishes of the living.

308
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Wishes?

309
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Our children and daughters get married and have children.

310
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Isn't it just after Tuo Ge died,

311
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
someone was thinking about it?

312
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Six yuan in total.

313
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Okay.

314
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Okay, thank you.

315
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
This morning,

316
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,040
it was like someone was leaving.

317
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,040
It's like a hole in your heart.

318
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Because we care about you,

319
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
it's hard to bear.

320
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,040
This is the thought of the owner just now?

321
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Yes.

322
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Senior Gu saved my life.

323
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
He taught me several times.

324
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,040
He and I are like family.

325
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Before he left, he especially told me

326
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
that our background is still unknown.

327
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't feel guilty about it.

328
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Jinzhao,

329
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,040
we can't let Senior Gu down.

330
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Please.

331
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
After we finish the funeral,

332
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
we'll go to the Sea of Heaven.

333
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Let's go.

334
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Miss Mingxiu.

335
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Miss Mingxiu.

336
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Miss Mingxiu.

337
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
What's wrong?

338
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Miss Mingxiu and Senior Gu are missing.

339
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
They're all gone.

340
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
She must have gone to Mount Yuqing.

341
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Let's go find her.

342
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Without Yun Lai,

343
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
we have to go for more than ten days.

344
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Master, do you have a way?

345
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,040
The Zhenwu Alliance has got a spaceship

346
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
from Qiyuan Sect.

347
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
I'll go get it.

348
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
Okay.

349
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Jin, inform Xianqing and Zhao Yan.

350
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Let's go.

351
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Go.

352
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Master, the Zhenwu Alliance has got a spaceship.

353
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Qiyuan Sect is always in trouble.

354
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
According to the news,

355
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
there's a organization called Heng Daozhong

356
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
behind Qiyuan Sect.

357
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
No one in the martial arts world knows about it.

358
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Zhao Yan did another great thing.

359
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
But he didn't contact me at once.

360
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Gu Hanjiang is seriously injured.

361
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
He may not be able to make it.

362
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Zhao Yan is upset with someone again.

363
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
The person who contacted him

364
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
should be Heng Daozhong.

365
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
But Heng Daozhong is missing.

366
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
What should we do next?

367
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
We have to force him.

368
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Inform the Yinghui Treasure Shop

369
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
to sell the hot sea gem

370
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
and win the gold.

371
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Yes.

372
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Yes.

373
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
Yes.

374
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
Yes.

375
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Yes.

376
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
We should create a good atmosphere.

377
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Yes.

378
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
The sea is warm.

379
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
The one who has a heart

380
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,040
will know the wind.

381
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Your Majesty.

382
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Ying Xunwei killed Qiyuan Sect.

383
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Qiyuan Sect is destroyed.

384
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
It means that

385
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
there's no source of Qiyuan Bead.

386
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Has the hot sea thing been developed?

387
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Not yet.

388
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
But the subordinates have sent more people.

389
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
But

390
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
it's not enough.

391
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Ying Xunwei killed Qiyuan Sect.

392
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Ying Xunwei killed Qiyuan Sect.

393
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
It means that

394
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
they won't give us Qiyuan Bead.

395
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
If so,

396
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
the hot sea is our only hope.

397
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
Send more people to search for it.

398
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Yes.

399
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Your Majesty.

400
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
If...

401
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
If we can't find the hot sea,

402
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
we can definitely find it.

403
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
We must find it.

404
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Miss Ming is not in Mount Yuqing.

405
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
But Uncle Gu is.

406
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Miss Ming is not with Uncle Gu.

407
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
He won't do anything stupid, will he?

408
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
It's all about Jiuquan.

409
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Miss Ming, what is she looking for?

410
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,500
I've already taken the

411
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,040
Unable to guard the hot sea.

412
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Why don't you let me go to the dragon pond?

413
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
I must die.

414
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,040
The Dragon Pond

415
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Jiuquan is a sacred place.

416
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
It's said that it's impossible to see the future.

417
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Cold water, hot sea, and spring are unreliable.

418
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
The dragon pond...

419
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
The dragon pond is in ruins.

420
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
It's said that it can bring back the people who disappeared.

421
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Is Miss Ming trying to bring Uncle Gu back from the dragon pond?

422
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Jiuquan's whole family is in the lotus.

423
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Xiao Xiuyou has just inherited the Unable to guard the hot sea.

424
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
So she's back.

425
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Miss Ming is back.

426
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
You went to the Dragon Pond?

427
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Miss Ming, why are you doing this?

428
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Miss Ming, it's not easy to come back from the dead.

429
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Judging from your condition,

430
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
you can't enter the Dragon Pond from the Dragon Pond, right?

431
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
As long as there's a chance,

432
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'll go.

433
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'll have a try.

434
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Miss Ming, you can't even enter the Dragon Pond.

435
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
How can you enter the Dragon Pond?

436
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
You just took over the protection of the Unable.

437
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
You don't know anything about it.

438
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
You don't need to talk to me about this.

439
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Xiao Xiu.

440
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Miss Ming, let's go together.

441
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
We'll find a way.

442
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
Yes, yes.

443
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Maybe,

444
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Man Min will know.

445
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Actually,

446
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
the hot sea is in the Luo family.

447
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Man Min is the guardian.

448
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I've been hiding it from you.

450
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
I think Man Min has been guarding it for a long time.

451
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Maybe he knows more about the Unable than us.

452
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
Maybe he knows more about the Unable than us.

453
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,640
will know Jiuquan better than we do.

454
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,940
We can try him.

455
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,840
It's late at night.

456
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Not to mention that Xiao Xiu's internal organs are injured.

457
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,640
Let's rest for a night.

458
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,440
Let's leave tomorrow.

459
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,540
Yes, Sister Mingxiu.

460
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,140
You should rest for the night.

461
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,240
We'll go to Luo's house with you tomorrow.

462
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,840
I'll go with you.

463
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,740
I'll go with you.

464
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,640
I'll go with you.

465
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,640
I'll go with you.

466
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I'll go with you.

467
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I'll go with you.

468
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
I'll go with you.

469
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,240
It's late at night.

470
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,840
Why aren't you asleep?

471
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,640
I dreamt of some things that happened in the past.

472
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,240
Do you still remember

473
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
the woodcutter tree that was planted here three years ago?

474
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,840
I remember.

475
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,840
That was a tree with a great shape.

476
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,240
I also remember

477
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
that you loved woodcutting.

478
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,440
Three years ago, a plague happened in my whole pulse.

479
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,640
Teacher took me to investigate.

480
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,240
That was when I was also at a very young age.

481
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,840
Teacher asked me to take the monster beast from the Flower Forest to train.

482
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,240
Teacher, I'll go to the monster forest to defeat the monster beast first.

483
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,840
Then, when Xiu'er comes out,

484
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,640
can you plant a woodcutter tree for Xiu'er?

485
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,240
I don't care. It's a deal.

486
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,640
But when I come out of the forest...

487
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,040
Teacher!

488
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,640
Teacher, I've taken care of the monster beast inside.

489
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Teacher, Xiu'er's flower...

490
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Xiu'er's flower...

491
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,040
I saw the flowers blooming here.

492
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
I can't wait to see them.

493
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,840
I understand, Teacher.

494
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,240
I understand.

495
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,840
After I came back from the spring,

496
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,240
Teacher spent the whole night under the woodcutter tree.

497
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
When I woke up the next day,

498
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
I found that Teacher had cut the tree.

499
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,640
The one Xiu'er planted was this jade tree.

500
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Jade? There's a jade tree.

501
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,440
That day, Han Jiangsheng was alone outside the desert.

502
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,240
Did something happen?

503
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,040
I don't know.

504
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
But since that day,

505
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,040
a lot of things

506
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,440
seem to have changed without me knowing.

507
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,040
I'm sorry.

508
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I'm sorry.

509
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
I'm sorry.

510
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I'm sorry.

511
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
I'm sorry.

512
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm sorry.

513
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm sorry.

514
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm sorry.

516
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
I'm sorry.

517
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm sorry.

519
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm sorry.

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
No more pain.

522
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,360
I'm here to support you.

523
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,600
If an illusory life is like a fishy year

524
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,460
It's difficult to forget

525
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:00,700
smile is now able to cover its parliament

526
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:14,240
water always flows, trunk is

527
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,200
i part

528
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I will never leave you

529
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I am looking for you with all my heart

530
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I will spend my whole life with you

531
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,200
The rain slowly pours into your heart

532
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Don't doubt that I am always like this

533
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:55,200
When the wind rises, the rain stops

534
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,200
When the old memories

535
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,200
When we get closer

536
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Look at the north star

537
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Heartache, anxiety, sadness

538
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,200
The story has no trace

539
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
The color of the moon is wrong

540
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Write a memory

541
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
It's all about you

542
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
All the reincarnations are like the rain, you are wrong

543
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Everything is unforgettable, it's you

544
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
The past is one screen, one screen

545
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
How many smiles and tears

546
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,200
I will be happy with you

547
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I am looking for you

548
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
The empty mountain valley is my memory

549
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
With the true experience

550
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Your voice

551
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
I will never leave you

552
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I am looking for you

553
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I will spend my whole life with you

554
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,200
The rain slowly pours into your heart

555
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Don't doubt that I am always like this
