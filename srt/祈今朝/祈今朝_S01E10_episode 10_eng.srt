1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,980


2
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past 

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us 

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,740
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,972
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,584
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,220
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,424
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:38,276
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,504
   

19
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,804
   

20
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,800
   

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,816
   

22
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,980
I am finally home.

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,380
   

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,299
What? Do you know why you were punished?

25
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:46,999
Copy the book.

26
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,940
He bullied Third Brother.

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,780
You almost beat him to death because you were mad?

28
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,279
No.

29
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,480
If I'd known that cliff was unstable,

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,590
of course I wouldn't have been so heavy handed.

31
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,039
If you'd known? You'd never know everything.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,940
Some things are better not knowing.

33
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,060
I don't understand.

34
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,731
You're always hiding things from me anyway.

35
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:22,000
So, Second Sister, what is the relationship between Yue Jinzhao and Third Brother?

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Why do they look exactly alike?

37
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,800
How many books have you copied?

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,040
- I'm still on the first one. 
 - Then you better hurry up.

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
You're not eating until you finish.

40
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,160
- Why? 
 - What do you mean why?

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,670
I didn't say that. Eldest Brother said it.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,270
   

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Eldest Brother, I'm back.

44
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,860
How are Qi and Yue Jinzhao doing?

45
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,750
Eldest Brother, I've been away for so long, yet the first thing you do is talk about Yue Jinzhao.

46
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,819
You don't even care about me.

47
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,999
Take a seat properly.

48
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:25,240
Seeing you so carefree, I knew they were fine.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,359
Yes, they are out of danger now and were taken away by those of Mount Yuqing.

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,620
Enough small talk.

51
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,281
Over these three years, the progress of Qi and Jinzhao's Resonance Spell has been slow.

52
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,700
But this time, they've increased dramatically in strength.

53
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,460
I can't believe they could kill the stingray.

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
It's because of the Qiyuan Orb.

55
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,305
Previously in the Fujin Hall, Qi accidentally ate many Qiyuan Orbs.

56
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:00,100
The Qiyuan Orb contains the power of human life force.

57
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,680
So, it could be the key to Qi obtaining her power this time.

58
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,340
And Qi has also grown scales.

59
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,759
Has her mythical beast power awakened?

60
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,320
Yes.

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,789
Eldest Brother, did you take the medicine I gave you?

62
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,079
Your analysis...

63
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,780
makes sense.

64
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:35,019
It is just that the Qiyuan Orb contains all the dark emotions that humans experience before death.

65
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,090
Has Qi's temper changed after absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs?

66
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,859
Nothing changed. She can eat and drink, and is as happy as always.

67
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,699
After absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs, Qi's strength has greatly increased...

68
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,100
and her sanity hasn't been affected.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,019
This is beneficial for us.

70
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,500
Right.

71
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,720
This is Rehai Water that Luo Maiming gave us for contacting him.

72
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,980
What did Luo Maiming say?

73
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,459
He did bind Rehai with blood,

74
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:17,440
but also intends to undo the Bloodbinding.

75
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,639
No rush.

76
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,609
As soon as we're done with the Qiyuan Sect, I will personally meet our ally.

77
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:27,979
Okay.

78
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,799
Since everything's all right, I'll go check on Xiaoyuan.

79
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Wait.

81
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,639
She's currently being punished by copying scriptures.

82
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,079
If you go, you are not allowed to copy for her.

83
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,019
I won't.

84
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,814
She's getting headstrong. It's all because you spoil her.

85
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,567
Not just me, so does Second Sister.

86
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,040
Get lost.

87
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,940
I'll get out.

88
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,619
Eldest Brother.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You really need to take care of yourself.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,059
Otherwise, we four will be one short.

91
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,868
   

92
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,520
Jinzhao, I don't want to lose...

93
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,519
I don't want to lose...

94
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,639
What don't you want to lose?

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,640
Jinzhao.

96
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,890
You're hitting my wound.

97
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,040
It hurts.

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,339
Really? Let me see.

99
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,772
Qi,

100
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:36,039
do you remember anything unusual about you when you saved me?

101
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,179
Unusual?

102
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,200
What kind of unusual?

103
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,013
I must've seen it wrong.

104
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:48,979
Where is this?

105
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,528
Mount Yuqing. It's Sister Ming Xiu and Uncle Gu who picked us up from the cliff.

106
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,100
Senior Xian Qing. Uncle Gu.

107
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Senior Gu, thank you for saving my life.

108
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,100
The first thing you should thank is your own efforts.

109
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,600
Jinzhao!

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Jinzhao.

111
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Jinzhao, you are awake.

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You look much better now, Brother Yue.

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
Master's medicine certainly works.

114
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
It's not that my medicine works.

115
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,300
Young Brother Yue, in fact, when I found you and Miss Yue,

116
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,200
Miss Yue was almost healed,

117
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,800
and your wound was obviously treated.

118
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,100
And the demonic aura on you

119
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,900
was the same as that on Miss Shuo Xuan we met in Luori Village.

120
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,800
Shuo Xuan?

121
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
Why did she save us?

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,700
Does she have anything to do with Bian Luohuan, too?

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,400
Jinzhao, don't worry.

124
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,900
With my strength, next time I see her, I will definitely catch her and ask her.

125
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,700
N-No, it's not me.

126
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,800
Sorry, it's me. I'm hungry.

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,500
Jinzhao, I'll go cook for you.

128
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Wait for me.

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Senior Gu.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Sorry for the bother. I shall take my leave.

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Leave?

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Brother Luo, do you have something to do?

133
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,000
I just learned Righteous Martial Alliance wiped out Qiyuan Sect's stronghold in Jiangning.

134
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,400
There might be some new clues that can help Brother Yue.

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Won't you say goodbye to others?

136
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,500
This is urgent...

137
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,100
Then, Young Zhaoyan, you go ahead.

138
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,500
Thank you.

139
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,800
It's a long way to Jingan. Please let Xiu'er send you off.

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,500
Then thank you, Miss Ming.

141
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,000
Farewell.

142
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,700
I think she's desperate to avoid me.

143
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,400
There's a lot of weird and interesting things going on today.

144
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Are you interested in one more round?

145
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,700
I guess I can let you lose one more game.

146
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
That's quite arrogant.

147
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,880
   

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,700
Third Brother, you're back.

149
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Let me see.

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,800
You have no improvement in writing at all.

151
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,900
I want to go play in the snow. I don't want to write.

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,800
Do you want to play in the snow?

153
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,300
Go ahead.

154
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,100
But I'm not done with Eldest Brother's punishment.

155
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,900
That's easy. Same old rules, I will copy it for you.

156
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,300
Second Sister, I'm going to play in the snow.

157
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,200
Second Sister, it's best to be home.

158
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,900
I can't even drink your wine outside.

159
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,300
Did Eldest Brother blame you?

160
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,100
No. But...

161
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Second Sister, he had another seizure today.

162
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,600
However, don't worry too much.

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,600
His thoughts weigh him down and his emotions fluctuate greatly.

164
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Did you make him angry again?

165
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,200
No way. I am still better than Xiaoyuan.

166
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,500
Then why is he so agitated?

167
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Because the mythical beast power of our fish has finally awakened.

168
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,300
He's overjoyed.

169
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,600
You're the only one who dares to do that in front of him.

170
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,000
I think he is too tired.

171
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,400
I hope for him to be a bit relaxed and happier.

172
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,000
 Qi's power has awakened by absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs, 

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,200
 but it must hurt too. 

174
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,600
 She never used to cry before, 

175
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,300
 yet, she shed tears in Fujin Hall. 

176
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,700
Sister, I'm going for a walk.

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,000
She leaves just like that. She's quite decisive.

178
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,700
Do you want me to divine your future with Master Luo?

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
No need.

180
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,100
If we divine everything of the future, what's the point of living?

181
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
Xian Qing,

182
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,100
speaking of the future, what are your expectations for the future?

183
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,600
A demon lives for a long time.

184
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
I've been doing whatever I want for a thousand years.

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
I have no expectations.

186
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
As a demon, you've been doing whatever you want,

187
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,600
so why do you imitate humans and be trapped by love?

188
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,400
Do you need me to give you some advice?

189
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,600
We are all novices when facing love relationships.

190
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,900
Someone can't even accept his own disciple.

191
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,500
Don't pretend to be cool.

192
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Someone regains half of his demonic power back, yet can't even keep the one he cares about.

193
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,800
Yet he still dares to criticize me.

194
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,900
You cheated again.

195
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,200
I quit.

196
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
Someone is a scoundrel,

197
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,800
yet is able to bewitch others with his kind and gentle appearance.

198
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,700
I won again.

199
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,000
Three years ago, the memories erased when Qi left the Yujie Hub...

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
have become the star curtain over the Hundred Feet Spring Platform.

201
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,600
I thought you would never open them again.

202
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,300
This is different.

203
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,700
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

204
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,500
 Second Sister, look, she's so adorable. 

205
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
I still remember that day when Qi was just born,

206
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,900
you and Eldest Brother brought her back from the Sea of Clear Skies to Yujie Hub.

207
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,600
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

208
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,700
 Master. 

209
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,900
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

210
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,500
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

211
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,100
I found you've become completely different after coming back this time.

212
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,800
Did something happen?

213
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,000
I've been following them for three years.

214
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,900
I thought...

215
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,400
I'd already accepted everything.

216
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,200
But...

217
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,800
in Fujin Hall, when Qi cried after she accidentally ate the Qiyuan Orbs,

218
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,200
my heart still ached.

219
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,400
When she protected me subconsciously in Luori Village,

220
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,700
I was still moved.

221
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Seeing her risking her life to protect Yue Jinzhao at Yinma River,

222
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I even became jealous.

223
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,400
Perhaps I still can't let go.

224
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,200
Young Huan,

225
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,500
you once swore to the Chastisement Stone

226
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,200
that you would never use the Resonance Spell on Qi or expose your identity.

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,700
Otherwise, Eldest Brother won't let you go watch over Qi and Yue Jinzhao.

228
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
- You can't... 
 - Sister.

229
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm just kidding. Don't be nervous.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,800
You brat. Don't ever play jokes like that on me again.

231
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,700
Rest assured. I know what I have to do.

232
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,100
I am still Qi's master.

233
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,000
I will guide Qi and Yue Jinzhao to become the sharpest sword.

234
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:03,200
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫

235
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Qi, are you ready?

236
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,500
 Jinzhao, just a moment. 

237
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,800
 It's almost done. 

238
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,860
Qi!

239
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,700
- Jinzhao. Jinzhao. 
 - Qi.

240
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,800
- Jinzhao. 
 - Qi, what's wrong?

241
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,000
I just wanted to make you a bowl of noodles.

242
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,300
So how is it?

243
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Have a taste.

244
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,200
It looks good.

245
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,500
Of course. The broth is an herbal soup that I simmered.

246
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,400
It could dispel cold. Have a try.

247
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,800
How's it? Is it delicious?

248
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes. These are the best noodles I've ever had.

249
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Really? I'll have a taste, too.

250
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
- You're lying. 
 - I'm not.

251
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,100
Everyone has different tastes.

252
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
It's really delicious.

253
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,400
Why did you suddenly want to cook me noodles? I used to cook them for you before.

254
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,000
I also wanted to do something.

255
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Why do you say so all of a sudden?

256
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,000
When you were unconscious, Uncle Gu told me we have to grow up.

257
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,900
We need to think about what we want to do and what we can do,

258
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,700
and we can't always listen to others.

259
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,200
You want to grow up that much?

260
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,600
Yes. Only when I grow up can I become stronger,

261
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
and protect those whom I want to protect.

262
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,900
You used to protect me all the time.

263
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Jinzhao, I also want to protect you from now on.

264
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,400
It seems our Qi has really grown up.

265
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,500
Okay, you protect me.

266
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,300
Don't eat anymore.

267
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,800
I cooked it wrong, I'll make you another bowl.

268
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,800
 If you learn to make noodles, then you won't need me to cook for you anymore. 

269
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Miss Yue can resonate with the key ring.

270
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,600
It seems that she has a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

271
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,200
Senior.

272
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,100
Senior, do you know divination?

273
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,600
Young Brother Yue, do you believe in divination?

274
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,300
Then could you please do a divination for me and Qi?

275
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,200
I want to know more about our origins.

276
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,400
Sure. Young Brother Yue, just tell me the birthdates of you and Miss Yue.

277
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,100
Birthdates?

278
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,000
But, Senior, Qi and I have no memory of what happened three years ago,

279
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,100
and we don't know our birthdates.

280
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
Well...

281
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Do you have any memorable date that could serve as birthdates?

282
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
Maybe we could try.

283
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,700
July 14th.

284
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,300
July... 14th?

285
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,700
What's wrong?

286
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
Three years ago on this day, I once encountered a strange thing somewhere.

287
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,700
I thought it might have something to do with you and Miss Yue,

288
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,100
so I paid special attention.

289
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,800
What is it? Where?

290
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
This place might have something to do with your birthdates.

291
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Would you like to go with me?

292
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes, of course. Thank you.

293
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Xiu'er, you are back.

294
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,700
Master, are you going to take Young Master Yue and the others to the Spring Vein?

295
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,200
How could you let them enter such an important place?

296
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,800
It seems you still have some sense of guarding the mouth of the spring.

297
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,000
I was just stating facts.

298
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,800
Young Brother Yue and Miss Yue might have a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

299
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,100
I had a divination last night.

300
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,700
There may be some anomalies in the Spring Vein.

301
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,400
It'd be nice to take some precautions in advance.

302
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,900
Divination is just asking for trouble.

303
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,300
Isn't it sadder to know the future when you cannot do anything about it?

304
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,900
The mouth of the Spring of Pureness can foresee the future.

305
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,700
Whoever holds the key ring may see a vision of the future in the mouth of the spring.

306
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,000
Is that why you've been reluctant to be the guardian of Pureness?

307
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,600
The future may not be certain.

308
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,100
Master, you are too optimistic.

309
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Since it has not yet happened, how could it be predestined?

310
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
You should go along.

311
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,400
Never mind.

312
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Since you don't want to go, then I won't force you.

313
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,600
Master.

314
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Master, we've arrived.

315
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,899
What is this?

316
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:24,600
The entrance to the Pureness.

317
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,700
This is Pureness, one of the Shennong's Nine Springs.

318
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,600
Young Brother Yue, you know about the Nine Springs?

319
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,000
I-I saw a mural once.

320
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,700
Shennong's Nine Springs?

321
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,100
What are you talking about?

322
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,800
Young Brother Ju, you'd know it if you went in.

323
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Pureness can foresee the future.

324
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,200
I am the guardian of the Pureness.

325
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,400
The bracelet on my hand is the key ring that unlocks the Pureness.

326
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Uncle Gu, were your ancestors guardians too?

327
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,400
The key ring is not passed down through generations,

328
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,500
but given to the chosen successor by the previous guardian.

329
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
If the guardians fail to give out the key ring and die,

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
the key ring will become like an ordinary bracelet until it meets the next destined one.

331
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,100
Senior Gu, does the strange event three years ago have something to do with it?

332
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,000
Exactly.

333
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,200
So this is what the Nine Springs looks like.

334
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,800
I've heard about it, but this is my first time seeing it.

335
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Nine Springs have various shapes. And the mouths of the springs also vary.

336
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,300
Everyone, come with me into the Pureness.

337
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,400
   

338
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,100
Where is this?

339
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,100
It's so quiet that it makes me feel a little nervous.

340
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,200
This place is near the Netherworld. Indeed it's tranquil.

341
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,100
N-N-Netherworld?

342
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,000
Just near it.

343
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,800
This place is called Wangchen Region.

344
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,800
At the end of this path is the mouth of the spring Cold Marrow.

345
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Isn't the mouth of spring called Pureness?

346
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,100
The Spring Veins are connected.

347
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,600
Since we have the Pureness key ring,

348
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,400
we can use it to enter the Spring Vein, and then go to other mouths.

349
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,200
But each mouth has its own garrison.

350
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
If we approach without the appropriate key ring,

351
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,100
we may be attacked by the garrison. You should be careful.

352
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,000
You mean...

353
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,399
When you pass through this dark place and reach the Cold Marrow,

354
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,000
I will tell you about the event that happened three years ago.

355
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,800
Is this a test?

356
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
All right. Deal.

357
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,900
Let's go.

358
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,100
Uncle Gu, aren't you coming with us?

359
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 You are not the guardians of Cold Marrow, leave now. 

360
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
W-We came with a guardian.

361
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,400
 Without guardians, the mouth can't be opened. 

362
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
 It is the duty of the Nine Springs garrison. 

363
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,200
Are you the one who guards the Cold Marrow garrison?

364
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
   
 I am Wangchen Siming. 

365
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,600
Siming? Quite arrogant. 
   (Title for deity of human fate) 

366
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,000
 Among you, two will die soon. 

367
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
W-What do you mean?

368
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
Don't scare us.

369
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,700
 This is what the Cold Marrow indicates. 

370
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,600
 Your days are counting down. You better leave now. 

371
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Make yourself clear.

372
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,200
She could be deliberately deceiving us to scare us off.

373
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't talk nonsense. We are not scared.

374
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,000
 You'll be punished by Heaven if you don't leave. 

375
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
You get angry when questioned.

376
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,200
The garrison of the spring's mouth is not that impressive.

377
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,500
 Are you all really not afraid of death? 

378
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,300
Jinzhao, maybe we should listen to her and leave now.

379
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,300
No, we have to move forward.

380
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,200
I'm with you.

381
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,400
Interesting. I wonder what lies ahead.

382
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,200
 Master? 

383
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,300
 Young Zhaoyan. 

384
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
 Qi. 

385
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Qi.

386
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
Qi.

387
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,500
- Jinzhao. Jinzhao, I am here. 
 - Qi.

388
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,400
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

389
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
- Qi. 
 - Jinzhao!

390
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Senior!

391
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,500
Ming Xiu.

392
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Shifang?

393
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,000
What's wrong with them? Why am I the only one who's fine?

394
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,020
What did you do to them?

395
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,600
 Qi! 

396
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,500
 Bian Luohuan. 

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,500
 - Bian Luohuan. 
 -  Stop. 

398
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
 - Qi? 
 - Master, take me away now. 

399
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,100
 Qi. Qi. 

400
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,500
 Let me go. 

401
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,900
 Qi! 

402
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,500
 I'm getting tired of the Mindlink. 

403
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,200
 Qi! 

404
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Jinzhao.

405
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,800
Jinzhao, I am right here.

406
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,700
Mindlink.

407
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,200
 Jinzhao, wake up. 

408
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Jinzhao, wake up.

409
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,600
 Jinzhao! Jinzhao! 

410
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,300
 Wake up. 

411
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,300
You can't go with him. You can't go with him.

412
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,600
I'm not going anywhere.

413
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Jinzhao, it seems everyone is trapped by a spell. Let's help them.

414
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Miss Shuo Xuan.

415
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,700
 Miss Shuo Xuan. 

416
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,800
 Miss Shuo Xuan, I am sorry. 

417
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,000
 I didn't mean to see you bathing that time. 

418
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,500
 E-Ever since Luori Village, 

419
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,400
 I've... 

420
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
 I've been wanting... 

421
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,000
 - to see you again. 
 - You coward! 

422
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,900
 Miss Shuo Xuan, I am not a coward. 

423
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,700
 I've told you, if you come within ten steps of me I'd tear you apart. 

424
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,800
 Miss Shuo Xuan. 

425
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400
 Miss Shuo Xuan, let go of me. 

426
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,100
 Master, don't! 

427
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,900
 Don't cut down that hibiscus tree! 

428
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,100
 Your eyes. 

429
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,400
 Young Zhaoyan. 

430
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,100
 Young Zhaoyan. 

431
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,700
 Why do you have to do so? 

432
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,600
 We clear our debt. 

433
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,200
 From now on, we don't owe each other anything. 

434
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
Master.

435
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Let go of me. Let...

436
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,500
Shifang.

437
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,200
- Sister Ming Xiu. 
 - Let go of me.

438
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
- Shifang. 
 - Miss Shuo Xuan.

439
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
- Let go of me. 
 - Senior.

440
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
- Let go of me. 
 - Qi, no.

441
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,000
We have to find a way to get them out of there.

442
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I've already tried.

443
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
- Let go of me. 
 - Try using Mindlink.

444
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Let go of me.

445
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,500
Let go of me.

446
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,100
Senior.

447
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,200
Sister Ming Xiu.

448
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,800
This isn't some new illusion, right?

449
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,600
 Congratulations on breaking through your inner demons. 

450
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,200
What I am about to tell you is related to this Cold Marrow.

451
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,600
Among Nine Springs, the Pureness can foresee the future,

452
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,800
while the Cold Marrow can tell life and death in the world.

453
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,000
Life and death?

454
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,400
Is it similar to the Book of Life and Death from the Netherworld?

455
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,400
 That's just a projection of the Cold Marrow in the Netherworld. 

456
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,100
Three years ago, I sensed someone coming in and out of the Pureness through the key ring.

457
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,200
Surprised, I hurried to the mouth of the spring,

458
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,500
only to find turmoil in the spiritual vein.

459
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,800
Following the turmoil, I traced it here.

460
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,200
This lotus tree is the mouth of the spring Cold Marrow.

461
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,900
 In the Cold Marrow, each lotus corresponds to a life. 

462
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,800
 Flowers bloom and wither all the time, just like life is born and fades away. 

463
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
 Each lotus corresponds to the fate of a person. 

464
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,700
 This is the secret of Heaven, not something the mortals can see through. 

465
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,300
It's really you.

466
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,000
I came here three years ago.

467
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,200
This twin lotus resonated with the Pureness key ring,

468
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,700
it appeared in front of me and bloomed.

469
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,600
The fate of you two is connected.

470
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
 The ordinary lotus should grow from a bud to full bloom, and then wither. 

471
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,300
 Just like the life of a mortal. 

472
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,400
 Yet this twin lotus appeared out of nowhere. 

473
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
 I can't tell its origin. 

474
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,800
Young Brother Yue. Miss Yue.

475
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,200
You two might have a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

476
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Uncle Gu, why is that?

477
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,800
Miss Yue, please give me your hand.

478
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
The key ring is glowing.

479
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,200
The key ring I hold resonates with you.

480
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
So you have a deep connection with the spiritual vein.

481
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,500
And the fate of you and Young Brother Yue is closely connected.

482
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
The spiritual vein has been unstable in recent years.

483
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,600
There might be some unforeseen events that will involve you.

484
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,200
Young Brother Yue. Miss Yue.

485
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,900
No matter what happens in the future,

486
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,300
I hope you remain cautious and fearless, and never give up.

487
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Never give up?

488
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,200
What do you mean?

489
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,900
You just said...

490
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,200
the Pureness could tell the future.

491
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,400
Do you know something?

492
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,800
Will we encounter calamity in the future?

493
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,800
Besides, you just said that two of us will die soon.

494
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,000
You were just lying, right?

495
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,300
 This is what the Cold Marrow indicates. 

496
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,400
T-Then who are they?

497
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,600
 The ones fated to die, of course. 

498
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,000
Goddess! Goddess!

499
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,100
In my view, decades are but a moment.

500
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,600
The spring garrison has existed for millions of years.

501
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,600
She could be talking about years away.

502
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,200
That's true.

503
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,800
All right, let's head back.

504
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's go.

505
00:39:51,980 --> 00:40:02,070


506
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,900
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

507
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,800
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

508
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,900
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

509
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,800
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

510
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,900
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

511
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,700
♫  The years leave no trace behind  ♫

512
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,900
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

513
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,000
♫  I fill the page with my memories   ♫

514
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,600
♫  All about you  ♫

515
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,700

00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,600
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

517
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,300
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

518
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,700
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

519
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,900
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

520
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,900
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

521
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,000
♫  Alone in the empty valley I hear my echo  ♫

522
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
♫  In the tranquility of this world   ♫

523
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
♫  I'm searching for your presence   ♫

524
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,200
♫  I'll spend the rest of my life with you   ♫

525
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,900
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

526
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,700
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

527
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,200
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

528
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,500
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

529
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,300
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

530
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,900
♫  Wait until the wind rises and the rain ceases  ♫

531
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,900
♫  Wait for the long lost silence  ♫

532
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,800
♫  Wait until we are close   ♫

533
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,700
♫  And watch the North Star  ♫

534
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,900
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

535
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,700
♫  The stories leave no trace behind  ♫

536
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,900
