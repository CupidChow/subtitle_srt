10
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,400
That inner voice has Family Luo's voice.

11
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,740
There's a reason why you travel here.

12
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,180
Why are you here?

13
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,280
Quit pretending.

14
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,100
Come and give me the spirit ring.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,760
Sure.

16
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
I'll give it to you when I see it.

17
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,720
What a big mouth.

18
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
When did this finally start?

19
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
My Lord.

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No one can hurt me in the hot sea.

21
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The medicine of the hot sea is the most valuable treasure in the six realms.

22
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How can I hand it over easily?

23
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What should come,

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
is finally coming.

25
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,960
The

26
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
The

27
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,960
The

28
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Commander Ying, your news is really good.

29
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
We just arrived,

30
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
you're coming soon.

31
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
It's about the hot sea,

32
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I have to come.

33
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Commander Ying, long time no see.

34
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
You came from afar,

35
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
tea is ready.

36
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Please follow us.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,960
The

38
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
The

39
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
The

40
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
The

41
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,960
The

42
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
The

43
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,920
How is it?

44
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Has there been news from Lang Mu?

45
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
I have only found his place in the west,

46
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
a place called the Mawanzhai.

47
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,920
All other information is unknown.

48
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,920
It's not too late, we will change direction right away

49
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
to the Mawanzhai.

50
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Xiaoxiu,

51
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
you go back to the Yuxin Mountain first,

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
I have to go to the Mawanzhai first.

53
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Yes,

54
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,520
You go back to Mount Yuxin first

55
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,920
and guard Brother Hanjiang's tomb.

56
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,520
Leave the matter of Wangwan Village to us.

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
You can rest assured.

58
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,520
Fine.

59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
I'll stay with Master.

60
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Me?

61
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
And me.

62
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
I'll stay and stay with Miss Ming.

63
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
And...

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
And...

65
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,120
I also want to guard Gu Qian.

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
That's good.

67
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Xia Shi Feng.

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
If Xiao Xiu gets angry,

69
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,720
you can coax her.

70
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
If she's unhappy,

71
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
you can coax her.

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,320
I hit people.

73
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
But it hurts.

74
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm fat. I'm not afraid.

75
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,320
Xiao Xiu has grown up.

76
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,520
She's happy

77
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
and a little sad.

78
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,760
I'll go with Hall Leader Ju to the forest to

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
keep the Yunlai Stone.

80
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
If there's anything,

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
just send me a message.

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,120
It turns out that whoever keeps the Yunlai Stone

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
is the same.

84
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
They're all family.

85
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
I'll go with you.

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I'll go with you.

87
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
I'll go with you.

88
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,120
Okay.

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,920
Then, the family has said goodbye.

90
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,320
I'll go to find Jin Zhao and Xiao Yue now.

91
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,120
Tell them that we're leaving.

92
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,120
What would I understand?

93
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Is it happiness or pain in the world?

94
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,120
What did I hear?

95
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,320
Like a voice calling out to me.

96
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,120
So my heart beats fast.

97
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Who are you?

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm not good at talking.

99
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
I can't take care of you.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Maybe my eyes are blinded.

101
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,320
Master,

102
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
when the time is up,

103
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll go to them.

104
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,120
They're so helpless.

105
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
I want to help them too.

106
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,920
I ask the fate and the end of the puzzle.

107
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,520
Can I ask you not to leave?

108
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,120
I'll go with you.

109
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll go with you.

110
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I'll go with you.

111
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,720
This is Xiang Zhenlin.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
There's a village in the forest.

113
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,520
It should be Ma Wan Village.

114
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,920
Jin Zhao, what's this?

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,320
Why are you looking so far?

116
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,720
This is Yangwang Tong.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
It's made according to the design of the ancient books.

118
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
I'll show you.

119
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,320
I can't see anything.

120
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,520
You'll know it better if you turn it around.

121
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
I see it. I see it.

122
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,320
I see it. I see it.

123
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
I can see far away.

124
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Do you like it?

125
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,520
The mechanism made by Brother Shi Fang is exquisite.

126
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
When I go back to the mountain,

127
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,520
I'll ask Shi Fang to make one for you.

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
Jin Zhao, look.

129
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Is that Lao Mo?

130
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,920
Yes, Lao Mo. It's really him.

131
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's go.

132
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,520
You're really here.

133
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Tong Manming,

134
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
hand over the Red Sea Pill Ring.

135
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I'll go with you.

136
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
I'll go with you.

137
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I can give it to you.

138
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,320
But

139
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,920
I want to see who gives me the price

140
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
and who is more compatible with my heart.

141
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,120
What I want

142
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,320
is to remove the method of the Red Sea Pill Ring.

143
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Do you have it?

144
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,120
I don't have it.

145
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,720
He has it.

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
He has it.

147
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
I do have it.

148
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,320
But why should I give it to you?

149
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Ying Xuwei,

150
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
the misunderstanding is still in the heart of the Demon Realm.

151
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Since

152
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
you can't get the method of removing the blood phoenix,

153
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll hand over the Red Sea Pill Ring to His Majesty.

154
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,520
What if His Majesty wants to eat it?

155
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Mr. Luo,

156
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,120
are you threatening me?

157
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
How could I?

158
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,520
I just want you to stay.

159
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
It's better to have a wound and food.

160
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
The power of the eyes

161
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
is lost in the world.

162
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,920
It will threaten the six realms.

163
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
We are all concerned about this.

164
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,520
We don't want to see this happen.

165
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,920
I can tell you how to remove the blood phoenix.

166
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,720
But on my condition,

167
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,520
I'll keep the Red Sea Pill Ring.

168
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
For you.

169
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,520
When the blood phoenix is removed,

170
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,920
I'll hand over the Red Sea Pill Ring to Commander Feng Yuying.

171
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
I'll keep the Red Sea Pill Ring.

172
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
It's you.

173
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
Sorry for the inconvenience.

174
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Lang Mo,

176
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
were you looking for prey?

177
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes.

178
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm looking for a monster.

179
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,320
Others are desperate to see a monster.

180
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,920
Why did you look for it?

181
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,720
It's a long story.

182
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,720
In the Fall Sun Village,

183
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
the owner of the family

184
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
used the treasure that was brought back from Qiyuan Sect

185
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,720
to be our return home property.

186
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
I suggest the beads are beautiful.

187
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
I want to bring it back

188
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,920
and give it to my wife, Yu Xiang.

189
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,920
It's beautiful.

190
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,520
Put it on.

191
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,920
It's beautiful.

192
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,920
But who knew after Yu Xiang brought the beads,

193
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,520
the beads were embedded in her body.

194
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,720
After the fall,

195
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,720
Yu Xiang's body is getting worse.

196
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm looking for a monster

197
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,520
to get the monster's internal pill

198
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,320
and keep Yu Xiang alive.

199
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,920
Qi Yuan Zhu?

200
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
That's right.

201
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,920
Everyone, you're looking for Qi Yuan Zhu.

202
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Do you know how to get it?

203
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,520
Can you take us

204
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,120
to see how Miss Yu Xiang is doing?

205
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
This way, please.

206
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Zhu Yu,

207
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm here.

208
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
Qi Yuan Zhu is prepared to be sent to the tribe.

209
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
Why do you insist on getting the hot sea?

210
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,120
Qi Yuan Zhu is from humans.

211
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Its vitality

212
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
contains the dark emotions of humans.

213
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,720
It's not as pure as the hot sea.

214
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Nowadays,

215
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,920
I often feel strange.

216
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,120
Before I lost my mind,

217
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,520
I wanted to cure the fish tribe.

218
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,720
It's the most stable way

219
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:22,900
to bring the fish tribe into the time

220
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
and get it.

221
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,520
That's just sacrificing the fish tribe

222
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,120
to get your so-called safety.

223
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
How is it stable?

224
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,520
You're afraid you can't control me?

225
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,560
I'll just knock myself into a trapC太 levels

226
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,360
and eat it withoutemed.

227
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
Everyone, this way, please.

228
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,160
Yuxiang.

230
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,360
Yuxiang.

231
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,040
Do you remember

232
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,040
I told you

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,360
to save our master Luo?

234
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,480
He's here.

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,840
Yuxiang.

236
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,400
Yuxiang.

237
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
He's been like this for a long time.

238
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,640
He's been relying on the herbs I picked.

239
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,160
And the demon beast's internal organs.

240
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,520
It's all my fault.

241
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
It's all because of me.

242
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,760
Yuxiang has become like this.

243
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,880
Such a high person.

244
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,480
Please save him.

245
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Qingcheng.

246
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,800
They're so pitiful.

247
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
Let's save him.

249
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Of course.

250
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
But it shall not happen now.

251
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,280
Don't worry.

252
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
There's nothing to be afraid of.

253
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,520
I...

254
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
I can't even save you?

255
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,640
Can't even save you?

256
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,680
Yin Xiang.

257
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Sorry, Mo.

258
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,160
If I had found the Qi Yuan Bead...

259
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,040
Zhao Yan.

260
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,080
Don't pester yourself.

261
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,320
Yes, Zhao Yan.

262
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,800
It's not your fault.

263
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
Please come in.

264
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,560
I'll show you my respect.

265
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
Brother Lang.

266
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,920
May I ask you a question?

267
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Brother San.

268
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,880
Why isn't there any water coming from the other house?

269
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,760
The wolf demon

270
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,760
Will Lang Mo really do anything to them?

271
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
He will do anything for his wife.

272
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Thanks to Second Sister's help,

273
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Big Brother let us come to see him together.

274
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Otherwise, you would be bored by yourself.

275
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
It's not just watching.

276
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
I know.

277
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
It's not easy to catch them.

278
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
But Third Brother,

279
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
why do you have to catch them back?

280
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Xiao Yuan,

281
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
do you know that we are not doing good things?

282
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
I know.

283
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
So what?

284
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I will help you with anything.

285
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Why are you hitting me again?

286
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Just because we are not doing good things,

287
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
you still don't care.

288
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
This is the place that Big Brother and I

289
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
don't want to see the most.

290
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Although we are doing bad things,

291
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
it's to protect the six realms.

292
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,760
How great is that?

293
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Xiao Yuan,

294
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
no matter what the reason is,

295
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
doing bad things is doing bad things.

296
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Doing bad things is doing bad things.

297
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Don't think that we are great.

298
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Sacrificing so many innocent people

299
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
to fulfill our beliefs.

300
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,760
We are the one who will never give up.

301
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
But it has nothing to do with you.

302
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
When the meeting is over,

303
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
let Big Brother teach you a lesson.

304
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
I don't want to.

305
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Then do you want this?

306
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,760
I want to use a butterfly.

307
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Butterflies are more beautiful.

308
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
You are so picky.

309
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Lang Mo,

310
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
you are safe.

311
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Everything will pass.

312
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Where are you going?

313
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,760
There is a grassland in front of the house.

314
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I want to go there.

315
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
There is no grassland in front of the house.

316
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I used to

317
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
love to see the scenery there.

318
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Let's go.

319
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
They are here.

320
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Let's go.

321
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Go.

322
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Everyone,

323
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Go.

325
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Go.

326
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Come out.

327
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Don't be afraid.

328
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I'm not afraid.

329
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Hurry up.

330
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
The person you want is here.

331
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Where is the Magic Pearl I want?

332
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
I'll help you.

333
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Be careful.

334
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I've told you.

335
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
You are not a man.

336
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
Brother Lang,

337
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
can I ask you a question?

338
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
I want to ask you a question.

339
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
I want to ask you a question.

340
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I want to ask you a question.

341
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Can I ask you a question?

342
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
How do you know the Magic Pearl is here?

343
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
That's right.

344
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
The land is in the sky.

345
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,760
How do you know?

346
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
And you said

347
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
you were really here.

348
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Then you mentioned the Magic Pearl.

349
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
It seems that

350
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
someone from the Magic Pearl told you

351
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
that we would come.

352
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Yes.

353
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
The Qiyuan Sect has been in a mess.

354
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
The remaining soldiers are still here.

355
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
It's hard to get the Magic Pearl

356
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
to this remote place.

357
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Is it to return them to us?

358
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Is it?

359
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
You saved my life.

360
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm very grateful.

361
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
But it's about Yuxiang's life.

362
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
We know how to get the Magic Pearl.

363
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Really?

364
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
But you just said

365
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
you wouldn't live.

366
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
You can try to get it.

367
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
You can try to get it.

368
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
Go.

369
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Your Majesty.

370
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I... I really got it.

371
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Brother, how about this?

372
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
We need you to play a scene for us.

373
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Brother, don't talk to them.

374
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
Just take them away.

375
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Your Majesty, I...

376
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
It's all your fault.

377
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Run.

378
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
What were you doing just now?

379
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Forget it.

380
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,760
You lied to me.

381
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
You remember everything?

382
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
At the night of the storm,

383
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
I asked you if you were my master.

384
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
You didn't admit it.

385
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
I couldn't tell you at that time.

387
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
What about in the Sunset Village?

388
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
In the Luo family,

389
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Jing'an,

390
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
and the other places.

391
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Jing'an,

392
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Qiyuan Village.

393
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
You had so many chances.

394
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
But you never told me.

395
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Now,

396
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
you're still hiding it from me.

397
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
You were...

398
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
drugging me?

399
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Jingcheng.

400
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Jing'an.

401
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm so weak.

402
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
Come on.

403
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Come here.

404
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Keep playing.

405
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Don't move.

406
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
Otherwise,

407
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I'll be in danger.

408
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Let me go.

409
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Jingcheng.

410
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Jingcheng.

411
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
Jingcheng.

412
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
I'll kill you.

413
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Jingcheng.

414
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
Jingcheng.

415
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Jing'an.

416
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Jing'an.

417
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Jing'an.

418
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Jing...

419
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Jing'an.

420
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Jing...

421
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Jing'an.

422
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
Jing'an.

423
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Jing'an, are you alright?

424
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,680
Brother, wait for me to avenge you.

425
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,480
Yuan.

426
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,920
I hope Jincheng and Heyue will be hurt soon.

427
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,000
Brother.

428
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
Brother.

429
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,160
Don't cry.

430
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,360
Xiangqing.

431
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,960
Xiangqing.

432
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,800
You...

433
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,280
You...

434
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,480
You, come with me.

435
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,920
What?

436
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,120
You want to fight?

437
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,760
If you take one more step forward,

438
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll kill him.

439
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Are you taking a dead man back now

440
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,760
or you'll catch a living one in the future?

441
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,920
It's your decision.

442
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,840
You're lying.

443
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm not lying.

444
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I'm not lying.

445
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I'm not lying.

446
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm not lying.

447
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
You're lying.

448
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,320
You're not a team.

449
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm a demon.

450
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,840
Do you want to test the demon's idea?

451
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,160
Is it like a human?

452
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,160
You've made up your mind.

453
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,960
The injury on the face

454
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,640
I don't know how long you'll drag it.

455
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,800
You're driving me crazy.

456
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,080
Here you are.

457
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,640
Have eternal bliss enter heaven's courtyard tirelessly.

458
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,760
Qianyue, Qianyue.

459
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,860
So their Mo Daily 마일을

if not

464
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,280
I also think

465
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,000
Please

466
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,860
To find me

467
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,460

468
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:38,960
Just because

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,700

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,480
Can't find really

474
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,400
This can't be

475
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,380
Can't be

476
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,020
Our

477
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
I

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
Qingqing

479
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
We will meet Yuching Mountain right now.

480
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Master Luo.

481
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Thank you.

482
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
You saved Yu Xia today.

483
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Although it's not a good herb,

484
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
I hope it can help this benefactor to ease his pain.

485
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Thank you.

486
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Master Luo.

487
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Master Luo.

488
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Is Yuexiong awake?

489
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
He's still in the hallucination.

490
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
What are you thinking?

491
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm thinking

492
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,600
that we came to the late-night camp for a temporary reason.

493
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,600
How did we find out about the Fallen Ring?

494
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Have you thought about it?

495
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I asked the Luo disciples to secretly investigate the whereabouts of the Cold-dry ink.

496
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
The only secret treasure that can be found out about the Luo family

497
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
is the secret seal.

498
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
The secret seal.

499
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,600
So you suspect that Luo Mei Ming told the Fallen Ring.

500
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
I don't know.

501
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
I thought I knew the secret seal well.

502
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
But now I find

503
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
that I can't see it clearly.

504
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Go to the Luo family.

505
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Make everything clear.

506
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
The Fallen Ring has brought the company back to the jade seal.

507
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
If Luo Mei Ming really colluded with the Fallen Ring,

508
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
maybe he knows where the jade seal is.

509
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
You may not understand.

510
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Mei Ming used the power of the hot sea as a weapon.

511
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Then there will be no one to fight in the hot sea.

512
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
So what?

513
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Even if I'm against the heavens,

514
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I must find the secret seal.

515
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
The Fallen Ring

516
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
The heartbeats are beating fast

517
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,600
The years are gone

518
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
The music is playing

519
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Writing a letter of memories

520
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
It's all about you

521
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,600
All the reincarnations are like the years are missing you

522
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

523
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
The past is a scene

524
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
How many tears of laughter

525
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
How much happiness

526
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I will be

527
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm looking for the

528
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
I'm looking for the

529
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm looking for the

530
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
The name of the whole of you in the sea of ​​the rain

531
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Don't doubt

532
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,600
My heart is always like a shadow

533
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:09,600
The wind blows

534
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Waiting for the wind to stop

535
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Waiting for the long-waited memory

536
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Wait for me and you to get closer

537
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Look at the north star

538
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
The heart is beating fast

539
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
The story has no trace

540
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
The music is playing

541
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Writing a letter of memories

542
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
It's all about you

543
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,600
All the reincarnations are like the years are missing you

544
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

545
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
The past is a scene

546
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
How many tears of laughter

547
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
How much happiness

548
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm looking for the

549
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm looking for the

550
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
The lonely memory of the mountain

551
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
With the true memory

552
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
Your voice

553
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I will never leave you

554
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
This year I'm looking for

555
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,600
The whole of you in the sea of ​​the rain

556
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Don't doubt

557
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
My heart is always like a shadow
