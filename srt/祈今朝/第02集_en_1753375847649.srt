1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
You see?

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
Only the true master

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
can make these soul fish fly.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
He is the one who can do everything

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
and control the whole world.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Shut up!

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
If you say more, I'll kill you two!

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
What is the Qi Yuan Pearl?

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Where did it come from?

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
Qi Yuan Pearl is from human life.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Master!

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Don't try to hurt me.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
The people of Qi Yuan Clan have just called him master.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Didn't Yuexiu hear that?

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not the master.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
You are willing to see the truth.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Yuexiu doesn't want to believe the truth.

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Step aside.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I don't want to hurt the innocent.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
He is innocent.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Innocent?

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
The people of Qi Yuan Clan are cruel to the people.

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
You say he is innocent?

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Master, master.

27
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Step aside.

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
You are the master.

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Report to the public.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Go, go, go.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Report to the public.

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Report to the public.

33
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Come on.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Come on.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yue Jinzhao.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
If you continue to help the evil,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
don't blame me for being rude.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Luo family will never be friends with the evil.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You are a member of the Luo family.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Unless you kill me.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Step aside.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't want to kill you.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Luo family is loyal to the people.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How can you tell that he is the master?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Isn't it enough that he has eaten those evil things?

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How can you prove that he is not the master?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If he is the master,

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
how can you really kill the people of Qi Yuan Clan?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let me teach him first.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let me teach him first.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me teach him first.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let me teach him first.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let me teach him first.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Let me teach him first.

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Thank you.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,760
I just can't think it through

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,720
When I see her

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,300
I realize

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,340
that she is here

60
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,620
to take care of profound power

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,200
Right

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Baby

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,980
When Love Is Hard

64
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,960
I can only compromise

65
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,140
and kill a snake

66
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,520
I could also kill two birds with one stone

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,700
So, I can die

68
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,660
Jin, I'm Jin Zhao.

69
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,300
Jin.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,260
I don't care whether it's Jin Zhao or not.

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,260
Leave me alone!

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,140
Jin-Tai's thoughts about all nameless people

73
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,740
are become sopress.

74
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
Jinzhao.

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,740
Jinzhao.

76
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
He was trapped in a group of people.

77
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
He never cried.

78
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,740
He would even cry.

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Qi.

80
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,740
I am Jinzhao.

81
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Qi.

82
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Can you hear me?

83
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
I am Jinzhao.

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
I am Jinzhao.

85
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Jinzhao.

86
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
Jinzhao, don't abandon me.

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,740
Jinzhao.

88
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
Jinzhao, I don't want to be here anymore.

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Jinzhao.

90
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Qi.

91
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,740
Qi.

92
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
Qi.

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Qi.

94
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,740
I am Jinzhao.

95
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Jinzhao,

96
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
how about carrots?

97
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Okay.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
I will take you back to eat them.

99
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,740
You

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,740
still don't give me eggs.

101
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
I have to take her to see the doctor.

102
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
Don't worry.

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
There is a doctor in our Luo family.

104
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,740
But you two can't go anywhere for now.

105
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
The reason why Qi cried today

106
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
is because of Yue Jinzhao?

107
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Come here.

108
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,740
Lord Shengxuan,

109
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
kneel down.

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Lord Shengxuan,

111
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
it's all my fault.

112
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,740
I failed in the dream city.

113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I let

114
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,740
those two guys run away.

115
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
I was afraid that

116
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Fu Jintang would be exposed.

117
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Fu Jintang can't

118
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,740
be a stronghold anymore.

119
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,740
You two go to the village of Luoer

120
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
to fight against the wind.

121
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Yes.

122
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Get out of here.

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Get out of here.

124
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,740
Lord Shengxuan,

125
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,740
I have another thing to tell you.

126
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
The little girl named Qi

127
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
is really a good girl.

128
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
She is the master.

129
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
What?

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,740
Do you have any objection?

131
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,740
I have no objection.

132
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,740
No objection.

133
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
Little girl, I'll leave now.

134
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll leave now.

135
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Qi,

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Yue Jinzhao,

137
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
I'll wait for you in the village of Luoer.

138
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
No.

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
I'm not...

140
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
I'm not a pearl.

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Qi,

142
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,740
are you really a pearl?

143
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,740
What's going on?

144
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
I'm not.

145
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
I'm not.

146
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm not.

147
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
I'm not.

148
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
I'm not.

149
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
You are also my Qi.

150
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Yue,

151
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,740
the doctor is here.

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Doctor,

153
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
how is she?

154
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
How is she?

155
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
Well,

156
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
this girl

157
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
is not only free of cancer,

158
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
but also has a good blood circulation

159
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
and healthy body.

160
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
How is that possible?

161
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
She is unconscious.

162
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
She is obviously asleep.

163
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
She is asleep?

164
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Am I really asleep?

165
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Egg noodles.

166
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Jinzhao, don't eat my egg noodles.

167
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I'll arrange someone to cook it.

168
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Wait.

169
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
We have never

170
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
made any concessions.

171
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
So...

172
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Yue is really

173
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
a man of his word.

174
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
So...

175
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
So, I'll cook the egg noodles.

176
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
I'll arrange it.

177
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Wait, Yue.

178
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
I heard that

179
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
you and Miss Yue

180
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
are looking for your background.

181
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
Yes.

182
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Three years ago,

183
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
we woke up from the Wuyuan Village.

184
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Except for our names,

185
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
we don't remember anything.

186
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
At first, we thought

187
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
we were no different from ordinary people.

188
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Later, we found out

189
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
that we were born with martial arts.

190
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
So, of course,

191
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
we want to know our background.

192
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,740
Even if we are the leaders,

193
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,740
we are better than

194
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
not knowing where we come from.

195
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
I think we are better than them.

196
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
So, Yue,

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
what is your

198
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
magic trick

199
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
that you use today?

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
We have been

201
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
wandering around

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
and doing little things

203
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
to make some money.

204
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Then,

205
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
I found out that

206
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
we could trust each other

207
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
and make our own decisions.

208
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
I've never thought

209
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
about the name

210
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
of the old family.

211
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I think

212
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
it's better to call it

213
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Heaven and Earth

214
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
are both in the same place.

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
It's a little bit

216
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
connected.

217
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
Where is he?

218
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
He is so rude.

219
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I haven't finished my words.

220
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
If you two

221
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
don't act too rashly,

222
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
you are our guests.

223
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Take good care of them.

224
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Yes.

225
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Let's go.

226
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Let's go.

227
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Are you sure

228
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
that you are not uncomfortable?

229
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
No.

230
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
I am.

231
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
I think you are stronger.

232
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
Can you finish

233
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
your words next time?

234
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
I know.

235
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,740
I hope you don't worry about me.

236
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
Who is worried about you?

237
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Do you know

238
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
that you cried today?

239
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,740
You never

240
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
cried before.

241
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,740
I cried?

242
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Did you see anything?

243
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,740
I saw

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
that I was trapped in a hole.

245
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Even the strange voices

246
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
were saying that

247
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,740
when Jinzhao

248
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
abandoned me,

249
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
you appeared.

250
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
I was protected.

251
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Jinzhao.

252
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,740
Jinzhao.

253
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Jinzhao.

254
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Jinzhao.

255
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
Jinzhao.

256
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
Why

257
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
are you crying again?

258
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
I am hungry.

259
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
I want to eat egg noodles.

260
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Why don't you ask me?

261
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Two people.

262
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Here is the egg noodles.

263
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Okay.

264
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
I won't ask you.

265
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I'll give you all.

266
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
So tears are so useful.

267
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I'll give you all.

268
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
Rice.

269
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
You are happy

270
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
to share with me?

271
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
Today, we destroyed

272
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Qi Yuan's

273
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
share of silver and silver treasure.

274
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,740
We also cleared the stolen goods.

275
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
The other gold and silver treasures

276
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
have been organized to be distributed tomorrow.

277
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
There are some accounts

278
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
that need your help to check

279
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
if there are any other clues.

280
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
As you wish,

281
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
the Luo family's reputation

282
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,740
can be spread again.

283
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
But

284
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
this time, we destroyed Fu Jin Tang.

285
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
It's not just me.

286
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,740
There are also a group of siblings.

287
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Jinzhao.

288
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Why do you think

289
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
I will lose Qi Yuan Zhu?

290
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Why do I see

291
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,740
the past?

292
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Where did

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
those strange sounds come from?

294
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
All right.

295
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
One day, we will know.

296
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Am I really the master?

297
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Of course not.

298
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
All the way here,

299
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
although we didn't do anything good,

300
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,740
we didn't do anything bad.

301
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Don't think too much.

302
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
If you are the master,

303
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
I will read the name of Yue Jinzhao.

304
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Jinzhao.

305
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Zhao Jin.

306
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
It sounds quite rich.

307
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
But I think

308
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
Jinzhao is the best.

309
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,740
If I meet

310
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,740
those Qi Yuan disciples again,

311
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
will they still

312
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
treat me as a beggar?

313
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
That's good.

314
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
Don't show yourself.

315
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Tell them to

316
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
give us all the treasures

317
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
and treasures.

318
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
Good idea.

319
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
Then we will be rich.

320
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
After we are rich,

321
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
we will order an egg noodle

322
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
and a bowl of noodles

323
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
with ten eggs.

324
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,740
You are so generous.

325
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Then you,

326
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,740
should you give the drinks

327
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
to me in advance?

328
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
You think I am stupid?

329
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,740
It's a serious matter.

330
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,740
No.

331
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
We have been looking for the body for three years.

332
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
This is the first time

333
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
that there is such a clear clue.

334
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Yes.

335
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
So the Ming Zhu Qi is very panic now.

336
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
This means that

337
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
my left eye this time

338
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
is very accurate.

339
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,740
As long as we continue

340
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,740
to follow Luo Chaoyan,

341
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
we will find more clues.

342
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,740
That's right.

343
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Then we will follow him in the future.

344
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
No matter where he goes,

345
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
we will

346
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,740
follow him.

347
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
Okay.

348
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
So

349
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Yue Qi is not only

350
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
a Ming Zhu.

351
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
Even his behavior

352
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
is different from others.

353
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Zhao Yan,

354
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,740
Yue's siblings

355
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,740
have extraordinary experiences.

356
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Why don't you let them

357
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
go back to Luo's

358
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
and investigate them?

359
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Okay.

360
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Then I will take them

361
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
back to Luo's Manor.

362
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Bai Ming,

363
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
you should rest early.

364
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
Zhao Yan,

365
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
you still have something to say.

366
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,740
I am fine.

367
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Don't worry.

368
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Cang Feng,

369
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
before I come back,

370
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
I need to know

371
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
the rights of those siblings.

372
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Yes.

373
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
Jinzhao.

374
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,740
Sister.

375
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,740
I have something very important

376
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
to tell you.

377
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
What is it?

378
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
There is still one hour left.

379
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
Our birthday is coming.

380
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
This is...

381
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
The birthday gift.

382
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
This...

383
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,740
You bought this white one.

384
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Wait.

385
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
What's wrong?

386
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,740
You bought it yourself?

387
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Give me back the gift.

388
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
The gift is a gift.

389
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
The gift is water.

390
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,740
There is no reason to take it back.

391
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
As for this horse,

392
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,740
I bought it for myself.

393
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
But for the sake of your effort

394
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
to save me today,

395
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
I will give you a birthday gift.

396
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
The sun has come out from the west.

397
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
I used to give you

398
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
a birthday gift.

399
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
This is the first time

400
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
you gave me a gift.

401
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
When did you start

402
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,740
to learn to care about others?

403
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
You don't want to give it back to me?

404
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,740
The gift is water.

405
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
You are too shy to take it back.

406
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Give it to me.

407
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
Wait.

408
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Look.

409
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Here.

410
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
These two

411
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
seem to be a pair.

412
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,740
This...

413
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
This is a gift.

414
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
I don't want it.

415
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
It's mine.

416
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
It's mine.

417
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
You are so nervous.

418
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
You said you didn't

419
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
buy me a birthday gift.

420
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,740
I'll buy you a birthday present.

421
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I'll leave everything to you.

422
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
What is this?

423
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Did I just have a bad dream?

424
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:41,100
добав

425
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
uh

426
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,840
Yes.

427
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,560
Brother Luoluo, what is this?

428
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,880
You two,

429
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,320
this is Steward Luo of our shop.

430
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,280
I'm asking him

431
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,360
to return the gold and silver

432
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,680
that he got from Fujin Hall

433
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,640
to you.

434
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,840
Oh.

435
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,680
What?

436
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,880
Jinzhao,

437
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,920
the few silver tickets

438
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,680
you got from Fujin Hall yesterday,

439
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,800
are they the stolen goods?

440
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,080
I forgot everything.

441
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
Thank you for reminding me.

442
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,240
I was in a hurry yesterday.

443
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,960
Oh.

444
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,440
Brother Yue, you're really a good girl.

445
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,120
You're so generous.

446
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,920
Thank you, Master.

447
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,200
Thank you, Young Master.

448
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,520
Don't worry, Master.

449
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,040
I'll take care of

450
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,120
what you just told me.

451
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
I'll leave now.

452
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,760
Okay.

453
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,880
Okay.

454
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go, you two.

455
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,160
Brother Lu,

456
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,320
are you taking us to the Luo family?

457
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,840
Yes.

458
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,040
That's great.

459
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,080
I've always heard that the Luo family's house

460
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,440
is a beautiful place.

461
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,280
I've always wanted to go there.

462
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,040
Then you two wait a moment.

463
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,440
The carriage is coming.

464
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
Dear guests,

465
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,240
dear guests,

466
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
don't go in a hurry.

467
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,440
The bill hasn't been paid yet.

468
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,560
Impossible.

469
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,640
It was paid yesterday.

470
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,480
But this morning,

471
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,840
you ordered a fried egg

472
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,800
and two bowls of tofu pudding.

473
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,960
Here.

474
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,120
And two steamed buns

475
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,440
in the kitchen last night.

476
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,440
How is that possible?

477
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,680
You're so stupid

478
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,720
that you're so greedy.

479
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Who are you talking about?

480
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,960
Who is eating?

481
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
You'll pay for it yourself.

482
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
Do you know why?

483
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,200
You don't, right?

484
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,040
Then I'll tell you.

485
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,600
Because my money

486
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,880
is not enough for you.

487
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,600
You're so stupid.

488
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
Write it on my account.

489
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,200
Okay.

490
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,360
You're so generous.

491
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,560
Miss Yue.

492
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,600
Please, here is

493
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,920
your source of money.

494
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,520
I will collect it for you guys.

495
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,600
I appreciate it.

496
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,320
Then please,

497
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
look at it.

498
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,520
I'll give it to you.

499
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,200
Have some.

500
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,480
Thank you, Miss Yue.

501
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,340
This way, please.

502
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
Thank you, Miss Yue.

503
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
ave 팀 leaders

504
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,760
a buzzing glass for you guys.

505
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,000
Cute little thing that

506
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,960
Will you play music?

507
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
What other choice can gö store

508
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,100
How to measure

509
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,480
Your hands

510
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
I'm hungry.

511
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
It's delicious.

512
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,640
Sister is naive and romantic.

513
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,280
Brother is thinking about the gold.

514
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,320
It's right to take the gold from the Sixth Moon.

515
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,080
The four of them are not clear about their identities.

516
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,320
They need to go back to the Luo family and investigate it carefully.

517
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,240
Let's go.

518
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,280
The

519
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,120
Brother Zhao Yan,

520
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,520
is there anything delicious in the Luo family?

521
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,320
Yes.

522
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,120
When we get to our family,

523
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,640
let them make you egg noodles.

524
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,920
Brother Zhao Yan,

525
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,160
how do you know I like egg noodles?

526
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,160
I know.

527
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,320
Brother Zhao Yan, you must like me.

528
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,280
In the script,

529
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,920
I always stare at a person's face and I like it.

530
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,280
Miss Yue,

531
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
you can't say that.

532
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,080
Brother Luo, you read too much of the script.

533
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,920
Don't take it seriously.

534
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,320
Brother Luo,

535
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,280
do you know about the Qiyun Pearl?

536
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
I've been following them for a long time.

537
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,240
I know a few things about them.

538
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,040
Brother Zhao Yan,

539
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,680
can you tell us about it?

540
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,640
When the disciples of the Qiyuan Sect enter the sect,

541
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,920
there will be private accounts of each place.

542
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,000
In the name of the leader,

543
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
the Qiyuan Pearl will be transferred to the new disciples.

544
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,640
Then, by their magic,

545
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,120
the Qiyuan Pearl will be planted into the new disciples' bodies.

546
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,560
At first,

547
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,680
these disciples are still strong.

548
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,040
But because the time of planting is too long,

549
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,760
it will absorb the power of life in their bodies

550
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
and form a soul fish

551
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,720
stored in the Qiyuan Pearl.

552
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
One day,

553
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,560
the soul fish will fly out of the Qiyuan Pearl.

554
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,520
Those disciples will become statues.

555
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,240
The people of the Qiyuan Sect call it flying.

556
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
So,

557
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,920
every Qiyuan Pearl is a life.

558
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,760
I thought the Qiyuan Sect was just a fraud.

559
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
I didn't expect that they would be so cruel.

560
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,280
I can't do anything about it.

561
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
And I always have a feeling

562
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,280
that Qi and I

563
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,520
are like being deliberately lured to the nearby tower.

564
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,040
Be deliberately lured?

565
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,080
If Qi is really the leader,

566
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,160
how could they do that to him?

567
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,080
If you two are innocent,

568
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,960
the Luo family won't wrong the good people.

569
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,000
Brother Zha Yan is indeed the leader of the Luo family.

570
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,280
His company is well-known and his reputation is well-known.

571
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,640
Nonsense.

572
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,920
Who is it?

573
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,000
Who is it?

574
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,400
Save me.

575
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
Help.

576
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,560
Help.

577
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,400
It sounds like someone is calling for help.

578
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,200
Go.

579
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,760
Go.

580
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
It's she.

581
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
Go.

582
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,280
The dynasty girl mother,

583
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,520
who lives among the ghosts,

584
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,320
didn't like her,

585
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,760
и will be assassinated

586
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
I'll kill you.

587
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
No, no, no.

588
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
No, no, no.

589
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,760
Pull it out!

590
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,260
I really...

591
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,760
Miss, please stop.

592
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Help!

593
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Brother Shi Fang, what's going on?

594
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Master Luo!

595
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Brother Zhao Yun, do you know him?

596
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
I don't know him.

597
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
I've never seen him before.

598
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Master Luo!

599
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Brother Zhao Yun, do you know him?

600
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
How could it be Qi?

601
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Master Luo, help!

602
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Get lost!

603
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
If you keep messing around, I'll kill you!

604
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Okay, let him come up first.

605
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
Are you okay?

606
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Thank you for saving my life, heroine.

607
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Thank you.

608
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Yue Qi, you idiot.

609
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Why are you here?

610
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
I'll kill you.

611
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
He seems to have an enemy for Qi.

612
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
I'll try again.

613
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Look at you, you made her angry.

614
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,760
You made Qi and I look so cold.

615
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I...

616
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Don't think I can't tell that you're acting.

617
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,760
He really knows Qi's name.

618
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Does he know Qi?

619
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
What do you want?

620
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm going to dig his eyes out.

621
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Miss, it's really Brother Shi's fault.

622
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,760
You should let him suffer.

623
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
But you don't have to be so cruel.

624
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Forget it.

625
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
You've taken Qi.

626
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,760
I'll keep your eyes for you.

627
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Wait.

628
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Well...

629
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
Well...

630
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
I'm sorry.

631
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Qi.

632
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
If you come to me again,

633
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
I'll break your bones.

634
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,760
He's going to dig your eyes out.

635
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
You still can't bear it?

636
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
What?

637
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
You really look at him?

638
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
I didn't.

639
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I didn't.

640
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
You're blushing.

641
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Brother Shi.

642
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Are you lying to us?

643
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I...

644
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
I only saw a figure.

645
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Three-core fairy.

646
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
It's weird.

647
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
I heard Iron Fogwood is nearby.

648
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Why didn't I see it?

649
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
What's this?

650
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Could it be a monster?

651
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
Who?

652
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,760
I swear I didn't see it.

653
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
You didn't see it?

654
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I swear I didn't see it.

655
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
I swear I didn't see it.

656
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I swear I didn't see it.

657
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,760
I swear I didn't see it.

658
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I swear I didn't see it.

659
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
In the book,

660
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
blush means to like someone.

661
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Do you like him?

662
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
He's kidding.

663
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Let's go.

664
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Come on.

665
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Are you okay?

666
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I'm fine.

667
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Let's go.

668
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
You scared me, Master Liu.

669
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Shuo Xue.

670
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
What's the situation after the girl

671
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
ate the original pearl?

672
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
His Majesty is worried about you.

673
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Don't worry.

674
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
She's fine.

675
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
She even helped others to deal with me.

676
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Enough.

677
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I know you came to check on the chess.

678
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
You're thirsty on the way.

679
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
You're thirsty.

680
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
You exposed winter.

681
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
You're vulnerable.

682
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
But this time,

683
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
His Majesty gave you a task.

684
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
You must be careful.

685
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
It's all because of that stupid girl.

686
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
She's a girl.

687
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
She's a girl.

688
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
I'm sorry.

689
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I didn't mean to hit you.

690
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,760
It's all because of that stupid girl.

691
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
If it weren't for her,

692
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
I wouldn't have exposed it so early.

693
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Next,

694
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,760
you and the girl

695
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
should be more careful.

696
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Don't expose it again.

697
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
You don't have to remind me.

698
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Dan Xiao.

699
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Jin Zhao.

700
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Are you done?

701
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm done.

702
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
By the way,

703
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
I haven't introduced you yet.

704
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
This is Yue Jin Zhao.

705
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
This is Yue Qin.

706
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
This is Ju Shi Fang.

707
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
He's from the Central Plain Martial Alliance.

708
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Martial Alliance?

709
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Martial Alliance.

710
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
To eliminate demons and demons,

711
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
there are several tasks.

712
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Although each gang is formed together,

713
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,760
each gang has its own system.

714
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
At critical moments,

715
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,760
the leader needs to give orders

716
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,760
to fight against the enemies.

717
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Miss Yue,

718
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
you're really familiar with us.

719
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Yes.

720
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
I often hear that the storytellers mention you.

721
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
I also know that under your leader,

722
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
there are Yongwu Hall,

723
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Ti Yun Hall,

724
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
and Ji Qiao Hall.

725
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I wonder which hall you're from.

726
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
I'm from Tianju.

727
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,760
I'm the leader of Ji Qiao Hall.

728
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
I'm the leader of Tang.

729
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Tang?

730
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
I thought you're from Ju.

731
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
No.

732
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I should thank you for your help.

733
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,760
You're both from the same family.

734
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,760
I thought you're brothers and sisters.

735
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
We're just...

736
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
It's done.

737
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Shi Fang,

738
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Jin Cui Zhou is far from the Central Plain Martial Alliance.

739
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
Why are you here?

740
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm here to find Iron Wood.

741
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
It's very dry.

742
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I wanted to go to Luo Village to get some luck.

743
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
The Iron Wood has been dried for more than 50 years.

744
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,760
It's light like red wool and strong like stone.

745
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
It's also suitable for making tools.

746
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Oh, right.

747
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Look.

748
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
The rough wood of the Iron Wood

749
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
needs to be used with 2% jade and 8% copper.

750
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
The iron wood needs to be left on it.

751
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Maybe you don't understand what I'm saying.

752
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
So...

753
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Please look.

754
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
It's so cute.

755
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
It can move.

756
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
It's really cute.

757
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
It's called Dou Bao.

758
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
It can fight.

759
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Did you make it?

760
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,760
My mother left it to me before she died.

761
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
But I can also make a machine.

762
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
It's just not that powerful.

763
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
Miss Yue is so handsome.

764
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Is it really related to Qian Yuan?

765
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
The Dragon Temple

766
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Wugou, Han Sui,

767
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Martial Soul Dragon Pool,

768
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Zhao Danyian Bo,

769
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Lu Zhao Chunzi,

770
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
and Ren Hai.

771
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,760
The ancient god dragon was worried that Jiuquan's power could be corrupted.

772
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,760
So he made nine medicine rings

773
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
and gave them to nine fighters.

774
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
They guarded the nine boxing rings.

775
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
But did he ever think

776
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,760
what price the fighters should pay?
