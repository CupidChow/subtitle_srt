1
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:25,020


2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,656
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,788
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,316
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,384
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,320
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,424
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:38,476
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,476
   

19
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:59,928
   

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,780
 Maiming. 

21
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,397
Maiming, Bian Luohuan has been locked in the prison.

22
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,377
When will we explore his memory?

23
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,039
What? You can't wait any longer?

24
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,320
No, it's just that if he's truly Shengxuan,

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,719
I can find out where the real Lord Ming is,

26
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,360
and take the opportunity to take down the Qiyuan Sect.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,090
No rush.

28
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,150
I want to wait for Physician Bian to make the first move.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,950
The curse is acting up more frequently.

30
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,040
Do you still insist?

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,926
Y-Y-Yes.

32
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:33,293
Would you rather... let me drain all your life force...

33
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,220
than break the curse?

34
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,337
Yes.

35
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,350
Which one is good?

36
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,880
I choose you.

37
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,730
Young Yue.

38
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,440
Where are the others?

39
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,879
They went to Sister Maiming to ask how the interrogation of Physician Bian went.

40
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,749
Shifang.

41
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:31,482
Thanks.

42
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,680
I always feel like I've seen this crystal somewhere before.

43
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,580
I seem to be able to sense the energy inside it, too.

44
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,540
It's similar to iron poplar wood, but seems to be a bit different.

45
00:05:56,119 --> 00:06:00,059
Then can it help Dou Bao upgrade, too?

46
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:03,350
Right!

47
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,960
I can put it inside Dou Bao to try out its power

48
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,479
and see if its effects are similar to those of the iron poplar wood.

49
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,240
If yes, then we've made some headway!

50
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,000
Can I go with you then?

51
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,770
I think Dou Bao could use more expressions.

52
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,211
And maybe some more moves, too.

53
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:29,099
I agree. Dou Bao seems too serious.

54
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,890
- Then let's go now. 
 - Let's go.

55
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,579
Should I take this or that?

56
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,388
Young Yue.

57
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,060
What's wrong?

58
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,218
I'm thinking, should I take the chicken leg or the rabbit head with me?

59
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,370
Why not... take both?

60
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,848
Makes sense.

61
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,000
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

62
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,520
Then... Then can you make Dou Bao speak?

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,399
Let me try. I think it's possible.

64
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,350
Can it play drums and shoot flames at the same time?

65
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,922
Yes!

66
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,020
Still a glutton.

67
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,592
Little dog.

68
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,940
So cute.

69
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:40,680
You're so pitiful. It must be due to a poor diet that you're shedding fur.

70
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,330
Here.

71
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,920
Here you are.

72
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,079
Where did this dog come from?

73
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,860
Zhaoyan, pet it gently. This dog is shedding fur.

74
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,719
Young Yue, we still need to see Dou Bao.

75
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,380
Right.

76
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,880
You can have this too.

77
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,772
We're leaving, Zhaoyan.

78
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:15,510
- Let's go. Brother Luo can play with him. 
 - Okay.

79
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,068
So cute.

80
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,739
 Brother Luo playing with the dog doesn't seem like his usual self. 

81
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:48,410
 He's more like a young lady. 

82
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,679
Master, the lady wants to see you.

83
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,136
Okay.

84
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,080
Young Jinzhao.

85
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,540
Senior, what are you doing here?

86
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,779
Did you see that dog just now?

87
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:16,055
No, I didn't.

88
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,620
Senior.

89
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,730
What happened to your hair?

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm just getting older and losing some hair.

91
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,359
Oh, right! Young Jinzhao, where are you off to?

92
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,830
I'm going to see Bian Luohuan. Senior, would you care to join me?

93
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,899
Unfortunately, I have no interest in him.

94
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,220
So you're interested in the Luo family?

95
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,780
What do you mean by that?

96
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,079
You accompanied Miss Ming down the mountain for a trip,

97
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,519
but you stopped at the Luo Mansion and let Miss Ming go on by herself.

98
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,980
Moreover, you've shown great care for Brother Luo.

99
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,000
If you said you didn't have thoughts towards the Luo family, I wouldn't believe it.

100
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,219
But I have no intention of probing into it.

101
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:17,260
Among the many secrets of the Luo family, there must be something you'd want to know.

102
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Since you're inviting me, how could I not say yes?

103
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,684
Thank you, Senior.

104
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,304
So it's here.

105
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,220
Interesting.

106
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,068
What happened?

107
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,779
The big fish is about to bite the hook.

108
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,499
I've been waiting here for a long time.

109
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,344
I guessed it when I saw no guards at the door.

110
00:11:41,344 --> 00:11:44,160
The Octagonal Tower is the forbidden area in our mansion.

111
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,799
Trespassing is punishable.

112
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,160
You'd better explain everything clearly to avoid suffering.

113
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,279
Miss Luo, what do you want me to say?

114
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
For instance, why are you here?

115
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,360
I was invited by Master Luo to visit and enjoy the scenery.

116
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,999
But unexpectedly, you set me up.

117
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:12,700
I have a feeling that you intentionally walked into our trap. Right?

118
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,560
Somehow you learned about our family's connection to the Nine Springs.

119
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,759
But the barrier of our mansion isn't easy to break,

120
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:28,239
so you deliberately exposed your identity to have them let you enter.

121
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,759
Now, you've gotten what you wished.

122
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,579
What do you think of the scenery of our mansion?

123
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,299
It is unique indeed.

124
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,521
It's in the vast desert, but it's like a water town.

125
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,320
Seems like... it has drawn a life force from somewhere.

126
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,440
And this mural, it also arouses much curiosity.

127
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,180
According to legend, the great god Shennong was born...

128
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,284
with Nine Springs, each of which possessed wondrous powers

129
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,439
and holds the densest spiritual energy in the world.

130
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:12,740
They are the spiritual veins of the world and the most important sources of life.

131
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,200
Rehai is the force of life.

132
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,519
Your family prospered here.

133
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,999
The water source you relied on was actually Rehai, wasn't it?

134
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:28,219
And you... are the guardian of Rehai.

135
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,354
This straw-woven butterfly is similar to the one in Bian Luohuan's cottage.

136
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:53,219
It's not just similar. It's exactly the same.

137
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,639
This is Dou Bao's energy chamber.

138
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,379
Do we put it in there?

139
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,828
It worked!

140
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,199
The energy chamber isn't very stable right now.

141
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,709
After I calibrate it, it'll surely make Dou Bao's combat abilities level up.

142
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,960
Shifang, do you smell that? It's so fragrant.

143
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,559
Yes, fragrant.

144
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,400
It smells so good. I'm a bit thirsty.

145
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,566
   

146
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,428
   

147
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,420
It's good!

148
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,439
Rehai was supposed to move along with the path of Heaven.

149
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,779
But it has been bound to your mansion for over 200 years.

150
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:33,500
I think... the only way to stop the movement of Rehai is...

151
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,019
through Bloodbinding.

152
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,480
With your soul as the stake and a blood curse as the binding,

153
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,579
 Rehai is bound here. 

154
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:46,000
 However, from the day the Bloodbinding spell succeeded, 

155
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,759
 your soul was trapped, never to be released. 

156
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,639
 You can never take a step away from Luo Mansion. 

157
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,680
 This spell is against the natural law. People using it will be cursed. 

158
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,199
Physician Bian, you're really something.

159
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,980
You even know about Bloodbinding.

160
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,199
For over 200 years, in your family, no twins have lived past their thirties.

161
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,159
This must be your curse.

162
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,099
Back in Luori Village, I examined Master Luo.

163
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:30,920
A great deal of his life force has been drained from his body.

164
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,099
I guess it was done by you.

165
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,700
It seems you're quite talented.

166
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,779
But in Rehai, no one can beat me.

167
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,299
You're so agitated. It seems you care deeply for Master Luo.

168
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,099
Then do you know how to break Bloodbinding?

169
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,319
I don't, but someone else does.

170
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,979
Why should I trust you?

171
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,800
You must've been waiting for a long time already.

172
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,419
Right now, all you can do is trust me.

173
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,340
Why are there no guards today?

174
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,680
We're already at the door. Let's just go in and check it out.

175
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,736
   

176
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,976
Young Yue, Young...

177
00:18:02,632 --> 00:18:07,000
Young Yue, how much have you drunk?

178
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,540
Wake up! Wake up, Young...

179
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:16,739
My goodness. Let's go. Let's go.

180
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:23,359
If you want to bring back Rehai to its original path, feel free to take it.

181
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,539
But there's one thing about Miss Yue that's very interesting.

182
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:30,060
Say it.

183
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,759
The Nine Springs are very secretive.

184
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,181
I once used Memory Exploration on Miss Yue

185
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:38,200
and discovered that she knew about the Nine Springs.

186
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,020
Also...

187
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,140
she said her master told her.

188
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,879
Miss Yue consumed the Qiyuan Orb,

189
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,339
so she was considered to be Lord Ming of the Qiyuan Sect.

190
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,519
While you're suspected of being Shengxuan.

191
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,588
And you risked your life to detoxify her, too.

192
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,540
It seems like you two have a pretty intense relationship.

193
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:14,100
Are you Miss Yue's master?

194
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,336
Since you two are here, please come up then.

195
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,300
Where's Bian Luohuan?

196
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

197
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,600
You trespassed on our forbidden area. Shouldn't you give me an explanation first?

198
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,300
You should explain to us first.

199
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,000
You secretly probed into Qi's background

200
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,400
and this time, you had a private meeting with Bian Luohuan of the Qiyuan Sect.

201
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,600
Exactly who should be explaining things?

202
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,400
What do you think this place is, your personal playground?

203
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,600
How can you come and go as you please?

204
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,700
Maiming!

205
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
They're my friends.

206
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
 Adam's apple? This is a man. 

207
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,800
I had a lapse and you managed to take advantage of it.

208
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,600
Sir, please don't hurt Maiming.

209
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
Don't worry. I won't.

210
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Nonsense. Could he possibly injure me?

211
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,900
Since it's come to this, I can't keep you as guests at our mansion anymore.

212
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,700
Zhaoyan, take your friends out of Luo Mansion tomorrow.

213
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,600
You've all been suspecting Bian Luohuan is Qiyuan Sect's Shengxuan.

214
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,800
You can take him to the Righteous Martial Alliance in the Central Plains then.

215
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,200
The alliance and the sect have been at each other's throats for many years.

216
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
They will give you all an answer.

217
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
Brother Yue, you're here?

218
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,200
Young Yue has blacked out from drinking.

219
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,400
What?

220
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,500
Senior, I'll take my leave.

221
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,600
You're still here, so I guess you want to ask something. Right?

222
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,100
You're as smart as they say.

223
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
Today, we rashly intruded into the forbidden area of your mansion.

224
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
I hope you and Young Zhaoyan won't take offense.

225
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,200
No harm done.

226
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,300
I've long admired your reputation, Senior Xian Qing.

227
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,100
Zhaoyan, you mentioned before that I resembled one of your family members.

228
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,500
That must be Miss Luo. Right?

229
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,700
What makes you say that?

230
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,600
It's not a good thing for a lady to resemble me.

231
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,900
My words are abrupt. Please forgive me.

232
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,700
You and my father were old acquaintances.

233
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,800
You've done my family a favor. How could I possibly blame you?

234
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
You were an old acquaintance of my father?

235
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
We met decades ago.

236
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,100
We had agreed to meet again in the future.

237
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,300
Unfortunately, he didn't show up.

238
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,800
 I beg you! I beg you! Could you please lend me your demonic orb to save my daughter? 

239
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 I'm begging you! I'm begging you! 

240
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,600
 Interesting. 

241
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 But, human, if I give you my demonic orb... what will you give me in return? 

242
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,320
 My life. 

243
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,600
 I'll exchange my life for my daughter's life. 

244
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,700
 I'll give you half of my demonic power, 

245
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,300
 but you must remember your promise and come back in three months. 

246
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 I'll devour you then. 

247
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
 It's a deal. 

248
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,600
 So, Young Zhaoyan clearly doesn't know about this. 

249
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,000
Before my father passed away, he spoke of a three-month deadline.

250
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But he died mysteriously before the three months were due.

251
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,900
I am in anguish over an old friend's death.

252
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,500
I shall take my leave now.

253
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:36,688
Young Zhaoyan...

254
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:45,200
your naivety is truly irresistible to people like us.

255
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,000
 So, Luo Wangping died before he could fulfill his promise. 

256
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,559
 Well then, let bygones be bygones. 

257
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Luo Maiming has my demonic power inside, too.

258
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,400
But why would those two want to exchange identities?

259
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Young Jinzhao was right about this. The Luo family does have quite a few secrets.

260
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,100
So interesting.

261
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Why did you drink so much?

262
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Jinzhao, don't leave.

263
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,600
Are you all right?

264
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,000
What could be wrong with me?

265
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Your heartbeat is so fast.

266
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,700
You must be sick.

267
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
What are you doing?

268
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,400
You're so handsome.

269
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,400
A round head, big eyes.

270
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Dou Bao, how come you changed shape?

271
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,500
I'm not Dou Bao.

272
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,800
Dou Bao, just wait.

273
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,300
When I install the crystal in you, you'll be able to shoot flames.

274
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Call me Dou Bao again and I'll really shoot flames.

275
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,800
It hurts. What are you doing?

276
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,300
Shifang, you were not right.

277
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,800
This stone doesn't work.

278
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,200
- Dou Bao isn't moving at all. 
 - Yue Qi.

279
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,800
 Are... you Miss Yue's master? 

280
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,100
 Although Bian Luohuan didn't answer directly, 

281
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,200
 this straw-woven fish can't be faked. 

282
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,400
 What if Bian Luohuan really is Qi's master? 

283
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,100
Zhaoyan.

284
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
You're going on a long trip again?

285
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,800
The grand family ceremony is coming soon. You mustn't forget.

286
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,200
How could I possibly forget such an important matter?

287
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
I've prepared some specialties of the Western Regions.

288
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Take these to eat on the road.

289
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,300
Thanks.

290
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,800
Zhaoyan, I have something important to tell you after you get back.

291
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,300
Just tell me directly. Don't be polite.

292
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,900
Let's talk after you return.

293
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,000
All right, then I'll be going. They're waiting for me.

294
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
Have a smooth journey.

295
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,100
All right, I'm leaving now.

296
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,100
There's a tea stall up ahead. Let's stop and have some tea and take a break.

297
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,300
Traveling from the Central Plains, it's been green the whole way here.

298
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,800
Much more comfortable than the desert.

299
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Jinzhao, do you want to try this orange? It's very sweet.

300
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm not going to eat it. If you think it's sweet, have more.

301
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,300
Miss Yue, can I have some?

302
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,700
Physician Bian, if you want an orange,

303
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I'll go grab another one for you from the carriage.

304
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,600
Don't bother. I'll just have this one.

305
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,700
Jinzhao, didn't you say you wouldn't eat it?

306
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,300
I felt like eating it now. Is that not okay?

307
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,800
Brother Yue, this orange looks really sour. 
  (Sour is slang for jealous) 

308
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,100
Who says so? It's so sweet.

309
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,500
Everyone else is drinking tea and resting.

310
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,200
Only you're the most hard-working.

311
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,800
Senior.

312
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,300
What's this?

313
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,000
A letter from Young Xiu.

314
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,200
Mount Yuqing really is an immortal cultivation sect.

315
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
The Yunlai Stones and this paper crane really are amazing.

316
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,200
If you're interested, I'll take you there some day.

317
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,800
All right! Thank you, Senior.

318
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,400
   

319
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,200
Young Xiu has joined the Righteous Martial Alliance.

320
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,800
The alliance received the letter from Young Shifang,

321
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,400
so they asked her to come meet us.

322
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,600
My guess is she's almost at the Fengyan relay station.

323
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,000
Since Miss Ming is about to arrive. Let's head out soon.

324
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,700
What's wrong?

325
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,500
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

326
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,900
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

327
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,400
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

328
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,400
♫  Following your silhouette across thousands of miles  ♫

329
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,000
♫  Like a bird chasing clouds to the horizon  ♫

330
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,200
♫  In the vast sea of people, just one glance and I'm lost in you  ♫

331
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,500
♫  My heart can't help but draw closer to you  ♫

332
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
♫  Seeking a perfect ending  ♫

333
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,200
♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

334
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,400
♫  I've done my best, but our paths just won't cross  ♫

335
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,000
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

336
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

337
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,600
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

338
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,100
Senior...

339
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,500
When you were transferring your energy to me...

340
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,300
Remember to tell me in advance when it's about to happen again.

341
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm sorry, Senior.

342
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,200
Th-Thank you.

343
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
Do you have something to say to me, Young Zhaoyan?

344
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Thank you for saving me just now.

345
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,600
It's just a transfer of some energy. No need to mind it.

346
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,300
Just now, when you were transferring your energy to me...

347
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,200
Don't overthink it.

348
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,000
 Why did I get a very familiar feeling when he transferred his energy to me? 

349
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:22,600


350
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,300
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

351
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,300
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

352
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,500
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

353
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,200
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

354
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,100
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

355
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,350
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

356
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:23,100
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

357
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:31,300
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

358
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:39,400
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

359
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:47,100
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

360
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,300
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

361
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,300
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

362
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,600
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

363
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,300
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

364
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:33,300
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

365
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:41,300
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

366
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:49,300
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

367
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:57,300
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

368
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:05,300
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

369
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:13,300
♫  I'm destined to give my all for you  ♫

370
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:21,300
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

371
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:29,300
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

372
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:39,300
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫
