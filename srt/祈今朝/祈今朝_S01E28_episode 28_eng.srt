1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:20,000


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,800
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,900
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,400
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,100
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,400
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,300
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,400
   

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,900
   

20
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,000
You two, Eldest Brother has been waiting for you for a long time.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,900
Don't you want to know about your origins?

22
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
Then follow me.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,692
Eldest Brother.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You've all been plotting and scheming for so long.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Tell us the truth now.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,300
We must start from the very beginning, with the story of Zhu Yu.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Zhu Yu bound Mist Soul by blood.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,000
We have been collecting a great deal of Vitality Energy for her to feed on,

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and to heal the Yu clan.

30
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,000
But inside the Qiyuan Orb,

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,400
there were still some dark emotions left by humans on the brink of death.

32
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Zhu Yu devoured all of them...

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,800
and gradually became demonic.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
If somehow things got out of control,

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,800
the Six Realms would be doomed for sure.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,400
Therefore, we reached an agreement with Zhu Yu.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Once the situation gets out of control, we can kill her.

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
But only the child she created

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,000
with her own flesh and blood has the ability to kill her.

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,300
Zhu Yu personally named that child "Qi."

41
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
This is the truth you have long desired to know.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,400
What about Jinzhao? What does he have to do with this?

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,300
Three years ago,

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
someone told me about the existence of Yue Jinzhao for the first time.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,400
 Eldest Brother, there is something I'd like to tell you. 

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
 I don't want to hear it. 

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
 But I haven't even said anything yet. 

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,400
 It's always about Qi, isn't it? 

50
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,400
 Eldest Brother, Qi has been in the Yujie Hub for over a decade. 

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,000
 Long enough for her to know every single ant here. 

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Please, just for one day, let me take her to the Mortal Realm. 

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
 We'll be back the next day. Okay? 

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
 I won't give up on this. 

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 Stop right there. 

56
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,400
 Get her out of here now. 

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
 Eldest Brother. 

58
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,600
 Third Brother? 

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,900
 You're not Third Brother. 

60
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,400
 You weren't wearing this when I saw you. 

61
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,900
 Who are you? 

62
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,100
 I am Xiao Huan. 

63
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,300
 I can't believe you drugged me. 

64
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,900
 Sorry, Eldest Brother. But I am Xiao Huan, 

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,100
 from three years in the future, to be precise. 

66
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,500
 Then why are you here? 

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,800
 What I'm about to tell you may sound completely unbelievable. 

68
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,000
 But it's fine. Time will tell. 

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,500
 Three years later, due to severe injuries, I won't be able to resonate with Qi. 

70
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,700
 I will not be able to join her in the mission to confront and defeat Zhu Yu. 

71
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,400
 That's why I traveled here from Mist Soul 

72
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,600
 and made it to Dragon Pool to exchange for a new me. 

73
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
 I'll leave him in this time and space... 

74
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,500
 to resonate with Qi in this world in my place, 

75
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,000
 and restart the mission to kill Zhu Yu. 

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 I have erased Qi's memories, and will to send her to the Mortal Realm. 

77
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,400
 She will wake up in Wuyan Village, 

78
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,900
 with another person. 

79
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,600
 Another person? What about you? 

80
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,200
 He is the one I will exchange from the Dragon Pool. 

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,830
 His name will be... 

82
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,200
 Yue Jinzhao. 

83
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,300
 Yue Jinzhao. 

84
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,100
 His resonance with Qi will far surpass mine. 

85
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,200
 They will spend three years exploring the Mortal Realm 

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,700
 until they gain the power to kill Zhu Yu. 

87
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,930
I don't believe it.

88
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
 I didn't believe it at first. 

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
Eldest Brother told me Qi had been taken away three years ago.

90
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,200
There would be someone named Yue Jinzhao to replace me and stay by Qi's side.

91
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,100
I just couldn't believe it.

92
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Not until I went to Wuyan Village and saw you with my own eyes.

93
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,100
 Eldest Brother, I'm in a hurry to find Qi. 

94
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,200
 Stop joking with me. 

95
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,900
 Yes, Eldest Brother, perhaps you were mistaken. 

96
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,000
 Qi. 

97
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,300
 Qi. 

98
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,000
 Let's take them back first. 

99
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,700
Upon examination, we discovered that you could indeed resonate with Qi.

100
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,600
Moreover, your resonance exceeded mine.

101
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,500
So Eldest Brother decided to have you...

102
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,200
take my place and resonate with Qi to complete the mission.

103
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,100
We informed Zhu Yu about this.

104
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,200
She agreed to send you two back to the Mortal Realm to live for a while.

105
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,600
So, we brought you back to Wuyan Village.

106
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Huan was responsible for secretly protecting you...

107
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
and guiding you through your experiences.

108
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,400
And three years later, I really sustained serious injuries.

109
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,500
That person and Eldest Brother's words have all been verified today.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,000
 I cannot revive someone without a trade-off. 

111
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 At the cost of the existence of the wisher, 

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,100
 I can bring back the person they want. 

113
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,900
 The number of lives in the world is fixed and cannot be changed. 

114
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
 To resurrect the desired life, the wisher must sacrifice  

115
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,600
 their own life 

116
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
 and all the memories associated with them. 

117
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,900
 Isn't this just trading one life for another? 

118
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,800
 And after that, it will be as if the wisher never existed. 

119
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 The mixed up parts will be corrected by the path of heaven. 

120
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,200
 The traces of the wisher's existence will naturally be overlaid by others. 

121
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,700
 So you mean, what that one did will be remembered as done by someone else 

122
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,200
 and that no one will feel anything wrong. 

123
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
 Exactly. 

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,600
 Miss Ming, you mustn't do it. 

125
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,800
 If you exchange yourself for Senior Gu, then there will be no Ming Xiu in this world. 

126
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,700
 Sister Ming Xiu, even the traces of your existence will be gone. 

127
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
I've always been suspicious of you.

128
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,900
You deliberately schemed against me and Qi,

129
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,600
and even guided her to gain power by absorbing the Qiyuan Orb.

130
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,500
I didn't understand why.

131
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,180
Now...

132
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,800
Now it has all become clear.

133
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,900
Turns out, Qi and I are here to fulfill an important mission.

134
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,000
It was an accident that Qi absorbed the Qiyuan Orb at Fujin Hall.

135
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,700
The incident at the headquarters was my doing.

136
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,300
It has nothing to do with Third Brother.

137
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,200
You planned all of this...

138
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,400
just to get Jinzhao and me to kill Zhu Yu?

139
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,600
We would not have done it if we had had any other choice.

140
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Currently, petrification is occurring in various places.

141
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,100
It seems that Zhu Yu has begun to expedite the maturation of the Qiyuan Orbs so she can absorb them,

142
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,500
which means she has completely lost her mind.

143
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,400
 Have you seen my De'er? 

144
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,000
 It must be because of something your Luo family did in secret. 

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Otherwise, Uncle Nian's grandson's treatments would be going well. 

146
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,400
 Why did he suddenly turn into stone a few days ago? 

147
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Turns out all of this...

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,100
has been the doing of Zhu Yu.

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,300
If Zhu Yu is not killed,

150
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,600
the entire realm will be plunged into misery and suffering.

151
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,800
Brother Yue. Miss Yue. Those from Hengdao Sect must be deceiving you.

152
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
How is that possible?

153
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
Brother Ying Xuwei has invited us to visit the Sea of Clear Skies tomorrow.

154
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,700
We'll enter the Mist Soul and see it in person.

155
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Traveling back to three years ago through the Mist Soul?

156
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Yes, it just occurred to me...

157
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,000
that Maiming had collected information about the Nine Springs.

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,200
It was recorded in a book that the Mist Soul could change time

159
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,000
and allow people to go back in time to the past.

160
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,500
Young Jinzhao. Young Yue. We will go with you tomorrow.

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Xian Qing is right. Let's face this together.

162
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
Thank you.

163
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
Jinzhao.

164
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,400
Miss Yue, he may need some time to process it.

165
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,200
Young Yue, go get some rest.

166
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,200
Miss Yue.

167
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,700
I'm fine. I'm going to get the Yunlai Stone from Sister Ming Xiu.

168
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,800
Second Sister.

169
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Drinking while you're so weak?

170
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Second Sister, have some with me.

171
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,600
That day, you took her to the Hundred-Foot Spring Platform,

172
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,400
I thought you wanted her to recall your kindness.

173
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,200
I didn't expect her to fight with you.

174
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I couldn't hold back and told her everything you did.

175
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Xiao Huan, I'm sorry. I should have asked you first.

176
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Never mind. It doesn't matter anymore.

177
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,400
Why?

178
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Why what?

179
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,900
Don't play dumb. You obviously didn't want to reconcile with her.

180
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,000
You wanted her to hate you.

181
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,400
As expected of my sister. I knew you would be able to see through it.

182
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Xiao Huan, what's the real reason?

183
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:53,300
I'd prefer to have her hatred if she doesn't love me.

184
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,100
It's better than being forgotten.

185
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,700
Jinzhao, don't stay by yourself.

186
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,800
I will be worried.

187
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,100
Qi, to be honest,

188
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,500
I don't know how to face you.

189
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,400
♫  My faintly red eyes rain tears that drench the past  ♫

190
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,200
♫  Blurring everything about you, wanting to forget but instead it only becomes clearer   ♫

191
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,600
♫  Blurring everything about you, wanting to forget but instead it only becomes clearer   ♫

192
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Just face me like this.

193
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
♫  The strange world keeps spinning, scattered by the sea of people  ♫

194
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,500
♫  The strange world keeps spinning, scattered by the sea of people  ♫

195
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,400
♫  We're like two ends of a story  ♫

196
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,100
If what the Hengdao Sect said is true,

197
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,100
as long as our resonance exists,

198
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,800
I am the one who manipulates you to kill your mother.

199
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,600
♫  Can't escape the memories, it's so hard to endure the longing  ♫

200
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,830
♫  Yet you're still not here  ♫

201
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,600
♫  Watching time flow backwards  ♫

202
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,700
Even if I am a weapon,

203
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,800
the one who can control me and possess me, can only be you.

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,300
Although I hate being treated as a weapon,

205
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,500
I prefer you to be the only swordsman.

206
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Qi, I don't want you to suffer a fate like that.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
♫  The unfamiliar conversation  ♫

208
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,200
♫  If only time would stop for me, at the crossroads of parting  ♫

209
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,750
♫  Achieving one desire  ♫

210
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Jinzhao, let's elope.

211
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,840
Eldest Brother, bad news!

212
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,479
Qi and Yue Jinzhao have run away.

213
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,219
Did you let them go?

214
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:06,120
Yes, I informed the guards in advance not to stop them.

215
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,480
Why? You are out of your mind!

216
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,999
We've spent years planning for this moment.

217
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,856
How dare you!

218
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:37,539
They will come back.

219
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,879
I know they will, and I trust them.

220
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,759
We have their friends in Yujie Hub,

221
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,179
they will not abandon them.

222
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,840
Eldest Brother, we only have half a day left.

223
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,160
I hope you're right.

224
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,339
 Qi. Yue Jinzhao. 

225
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,780
 This is the last thing I can do for you. 

226
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,459
I didn't expect the origins of Jinzhao and Young Yue to be so extraordinary.

227
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,248
Miss Yue came to borrow the Yunlai Stone.

228
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:23,748
She must have left here with Young Master Yue.

229
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:29,399
I, for one, hope they go as far away as possible.

230
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:34,000
It shouldn't be just them dealing with this huge responsibility.

231
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,199
Young Shifang, are you worried that the Hengdao Sect will take us as hostages?

232
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,862
Of course not.

233
00:21:42,862 --> 00:21:46,442
If Hengdao Sect dares to do so, we'll fight our way out.

234
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,420
I'm just worried that those two kids won't allow us to be held captive.

235
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,279
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

236
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,919
I'm thinking about my origin.

237
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,160
Turns out, my existence is to ensure the safety of mortals.

238
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,879
That's the reason why he exists. The world needs Yue Jinzhao.

239
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,259
But isn't this too large...

240
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,504
of a responsibility for me?

241
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,399
Has anyone asked for my opinion?

242
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,879
Do you regret discovering your origin?

243
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,668
Yes.

244
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,319
If we had stayed in Wuyan Village,

245
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,160
we would have lived a peaceful life,

246
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,639
poor but stable, like every ordinary person.

247
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:12,280
But then, we wouldn't have made it to Yinghui Fort.

248
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,800
We wouldn't have made so many good friends,

249
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,900
nor would we have had so many precious experiences.

250
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,180
Just look on the bright side.

251
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,170
Jinzhao, look! Jing'an is right there.

252
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,461
Let's go and have some fun.

253
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,319
Look! How beautiful it is.

254
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,808
Let's go.

255
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,076
Check this out.

256
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,319
Jinzhao, today, let's put aside all our worries and have fun.

257
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,632
Okay.

258
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,668
 Impressive. 

259
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:26,548
 Hit the mark again. 

260
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:30,664
 Impressive. 

261
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:34,932
 So amazing! 

262
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,164
 Here you go. 

263
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,780
Is it sweet?

264
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,119
Sweet.

265
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,320
Here you go, kids.

266
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,040
 - Miss. 
 - I want one. 

267
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,680
 - Me too. 
 - I want one too.  
 - Here you go.

268
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,380
 - I want one too. 
 - Miss, I want one too. 

269
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,699
 - Miss. 
 - Miss. 

270
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,800
 Let's go. 

271
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,480
It's really great to be a child.

272
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,359
So carefree, with no worries at all.

273
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,980
Yes, even if the sky falls, tall guys like us would hold it up.

274
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:09,324
   

275
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:19,936
- Want to write something? 
 - Let me see.

276
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:26,720
   

277
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,968
   

278
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,899
Jinzhao, people always make wishes to the invisible deities.

279
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,948
Does it really work?

280
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,859
Maybe they're not worshiping the deities but the heaven and earth.

281
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,440
The heaven and earth?

282
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,759
The grace of heaven and earth nourishes all beings.

283
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,719
They are probably seeking blessings from heaven and earth.

284
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,519
But I think people should worship themselves instead.

285
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,539
Even if heaven and earth grant them grace,

286
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:13,180
they still have to work hard to create and maintain good lives.

287
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,719
Yes, you're right. We're on our own.

288
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,479
   

289
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:28,772
- Yaofang, the moon is beautiful, isn't it? 
 - Yes.

290
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,489
Let's go appreciate it together.

291
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,922
All right.

292
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,920
Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

293
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,379
Young Hero Yue. Young Miss Yue.

294
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,920
This is the girl I told you about, the one you mistook for Zhu'er.

295
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,580
Miss, I am truly sorry.

296
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,800
I was confused at the time and caused you trouble.

297
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,260
No worries. You treated me to delicious tofu pudding, remember?

298
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,359
Right.

299
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,599
Mr. Ji, Mrs. Ji has recovered, hasn't she?

300
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,459
My wife is pregnant.

301
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:10,420
Ever since we had a child again, Yaofang has suddenly returned to normal.

302
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,636
Do you want to touch it?

303
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,979
Can I listen to it?

304
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,359
How come I can't hear anything?

305
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,000
The baby is still small. Naturally, you can't hear it.

306
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,639
However, I can sense every breath and heartbeat of it.

307
00:28:52,639 --> 00:28:56,600
Even in the noisiest marketplace,

308
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,600
I wouldn't miss a single beat.

309
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:06,399
 I often recall the days when I was carrying you. 

310
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,920
 I was amazed. You were such a tiny creature. 

311
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,560
 Yet your heart pounded louder than anything in the world. 

312
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,959
My mother said the same to me.

313
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,359
She must love you very much.

314
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,219
Jinzhao, do you know what I'm thinking?

315
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,780
I want the child in Mrs. Ji's belly to be born safely.

316
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,379
Jing'an is so lively.

317
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,960
I hope everyone can live in peace and safety.

318
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:00,780
I want to protect everything here.

319
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,300
Qi.

320
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,060
Let's return to the Yujie Hub.

321
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,640
I have thought it through.

322
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,479
Even if I start over,

323
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,560
I'd still leave Wuyan Village and embark on this journey with you.

324
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,060
Jinzhao.

325
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,540
I was an orphan born in Nine Springs.

326
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,099
But I grew up in this world, I think...

327
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,580
I should try my best to do something for its sake.

328
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,901
I'll try my best to find a solution that satisfies both sides...

329
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,720
to protect Zhu Yu and the Mortal Realm.

330
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,372
I know.

331
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,092
I have faith in you.

332
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,920
The jade pendant!

333
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,700
Let me put it on you.

334
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,110
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

335
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,979
There, now the pendants are a matching pair.

336
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,460
Qi,

337
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:34,139
from now on, no matter what happens,

338
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:40,040
I will always be by your side and we will face it together.

339
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:43,988
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

340
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:46,072
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

341
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:53,100
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

342
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,080
   

343
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,576
Do you want a drink?

344
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,848
A pre-death drink?

345
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,400
Xiao Huan.

346
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,859
Eldest Brother is waiting for you on the rooftop. Go meet him.

347
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:52,219
Your organs will deteriorate faster if you drink like this.

348
00:33:52,219 --> 00:33:54,639
Even if no one will treat you in the future,

349
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:57,080
you do not have to destroy yourself.

350
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,780
Sit.

351
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,848
Sorry,

352
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,680
for being an incompetent brother.

353
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,728
Well, that's true.

354
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:36,280
You've been acting smug since childhood.

355
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,499
Every time Second Sister and I made mistakes, you would severely scold us.

356
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,800
A terrible brother indeed.

357
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,300
Eldest Brother, if I had known the truth three years ago

358
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,396
and chosen to run away,

359
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,248
what would you have done?

360
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,228
You wouldn't.

361
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,219
Actually, I really wish I had.

362
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,040
But there are things that I must do myself.

363
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,240
Moreover,

364
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:40,939
given the blood of so many innocents on our hands,

365
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:46,780
we are lucky to have this opportunity for atonement, aren't we?

366
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,600
Want to atone?

367
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,980
Maybe in the next life.

368
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,174
It is an honor for me...

369
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,979
to have you as my eldest brother...

370
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,044
in this lifetime.

371
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,748
Drink.

372
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,479
However, I feel so sorry for...

373
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,199
Qi and Jinzhao,

374
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,919
who have to bear the consequences of our incompetence.

375
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Third Brother, why are you drinking?

376
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,140
You're injured. No more drinks.

377
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,640
Xiaoyuan, Third Brother is about to embark on a long journey.

378
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,820
It's fine to have a little drink before that.

379
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,880
I was wondering why I was allowed to stay up late today.

380
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:00,080
Remember to practice your skills diligently in the future.

381
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,600
If you piss these two off again, no one will stand up for you.

382
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,479
Third Brother, where are you going?

383
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:09,199
Somewhere fun? For how long?

384
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,380
Don't change the subject. Promise me first.

385
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,519
Promise me.

386
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,759
All right, you have my word.

387
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:31,220
I will practice hard and behave myself from now on.

388
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,350
- Third Brother, come with me. 
 - Let's go.

389
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:24,710


390
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:36,392
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

391
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:40,408
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

392
