1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
inflate

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't want to leave regrets behind

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will give up my whole life to exchange for another

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I decide to let go of my guard

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who will I give my heart to?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to fall asleep

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hope that there will be no regrets in winter

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't want to lose my way

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't have regrets either

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you are the secret of the universe

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I pray for a miracle

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will give my heart to you even if I'm burned by time

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I only wish to find you

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The miracle of searching for your name forever

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will never give up on my path

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Episode 16

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Qi Yuan Sect is too hateful

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The people who are fooled are also stupid

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They think they can fall from heaven if they worship a god

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They deserve to be beaten

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Qingming

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Master Ju is back

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I saw that

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Among the Hall Leaders of the Five Clans

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Only he has never fought with a real sword

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He has never won a fight

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He doesn't deserve to be the Hall Leader

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I thought the Jijiao Hall was gone

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Qi Ming, Qi Jun

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Shi Fang is a member of the same sect and a Hall Leader

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You two should be polite

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Master Wen, you may leave

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Shi Fang

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A Ya

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I haven't seen you for a long time

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to visit Lv Da Zhi's house now

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You take care of the guests

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll treat you to a drink when I come back

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Goodbye

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Shi Fang

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This brother is quite righteous

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A Ya is the Hall Leader of the Five Clans

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He is very good at daily life

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is also my best friend in the Zhenwu Alliance

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Just now, Xu Qingming and Chen Tianjun

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They are members of his sect

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shi Fang

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How many people are there in your Jijiao Hall?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Currently, only me

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That means

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There are fewer people who play the good mechanism

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shi Fang, I think you are better

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Thank you, Xiao Yue

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's go

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You look so cute

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Not bad

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, it's good

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And Nana

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's go

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Zhao Yan

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Long time no see

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We miss you so much

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Me too

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It seems that Zhao Yan doesn't miss us

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You still like to joke

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother Luo, why weren't you here just now?

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I heard the noise outside

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I'm not a member of the Zhenwu Alliance

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I waited here

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I didn't expect that

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Something bad happened

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't expect that

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Something like this happened

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We must eliminate Qi Yuan as soon as possible

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Welcome to the Zhenwu Alliance

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Miss Mingxiu

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How is your master doing recently?

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you for your concern

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Everything is fine

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Leader

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
These are the friends I mentioned in the letter

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's Xiao Yue, Jinzhao

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And Senior Xianqing

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I see

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I knew your names in the letter

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I heard your heroic deeds from Master Luo

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I heard it more clearly today

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Chief

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Shi Fang

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You went out for so long

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You only brought back two letters

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry, Chief

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Chief

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Chief

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shi Fang has helped us a lot on the way

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He brought back Qi Yuan's stronghold in Luo Rui Village

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shi Fang has made a great contribution

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Really?

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It seems that Shi Fang has made a great contribution

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Young heroes

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Try this special ice plum soup

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's best to be used to quench your thirst

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's cold

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Slow down

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If you like it

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can also

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
One more bowl

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're really welcome

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I haven't been back for a long time

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I miss my home so much

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I miss it too

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If so

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can stay here for a few more days

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I mean

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother Yue

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Give me another bowl

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Shi Fang said

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're also investigating Qi Yuan's tribe

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Chief

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Qi Yuan's tribe is evil

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's our duty to eliminate them

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother Yue

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I've told Chief about the case of the Fallen Abyss

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Zhengwu Alliance and Qi Yuan's tribe have been fighting for a long time

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But we haven't got any clue about their victory

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But you don't have to be angry

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Speaking of

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We've received a lot of anonymous information from many heroes

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Based on these clues

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We've eliminated the stronghold of Qi Yuan's tribe in Jiangning

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a coincidence that Qi Yuan's tribe's chief is on the local patrol

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Be eliminated together

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In addition

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have another one here

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The crystal stone found at the site of the Fallen Abyss

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Unfortunately, we don't know its origin

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Do you have any clues?

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Isn't this the crystal stone of the Fallen Abyss?

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why did it appear in the Fallen Abyss?

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why don't we use the crystal stone to buy a person's money?

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that we can ask Zhengwu Alliance to help us secretly investigate the body

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Qi Yuan

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you think this crystal stone looks like what we saw in the Fallen Abyss?

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I remember when I just woke up

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think I saw this crystal stone

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Chief

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We've lived in the village for a while

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Since this crystal stone is related to the village

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you don't mind

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We're willing to go and check

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Brother Lou

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Isn't it?

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Good

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then I'll wait for your good news

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The young heroes have come to Jing'an

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They've come to Jing'an

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll let Shi Fang treat you well in the next few days

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Come in, everyone

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is my secret room

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shi Fang

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Your secret room is so beautiful

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Shi Fang, what is this?

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is for measuring wind force

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's the use of measuring wind force?

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is naturally useful

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is used during wars,

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
during the Farming War

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and during the wind

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Zhang Yue, you're so good

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There are many useful things in my room

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll show you more

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Zhang

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is my room

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can visit it at your leisure

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've never seen a room like this

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't touch it

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is my defense mechanism

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You can't touch it

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You can visit it at your leisure

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Shi Fang is so enthusiastic about the mechanism

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not only enthusiastic

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He wants to use these wooden mechanisms as food

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The magic oil is a tree

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The oil is new

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
One day

201
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll show the world their benefits

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We need to rely on Hero Ju

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to grow them

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you, Director

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Senior

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Zhao Yan

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Have some tea

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Thank you

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You've been in Jing'an for a few days

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you have any good wine to recommend?

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I've been in the Zhenwu Alliance for a few days

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I haven't used up all

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Senior

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why don't you ask Shi Fang?

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes, Senior Xian Qin

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you have any questions

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
about Jing'an

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
you can ask me anytime

221
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Everyone

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm a little tired

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go to bed

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you, Shi Fang

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But it's a little dark now

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll go to sleep

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Jingzhao

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Senior Xian Qin and Zhao Yan

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why do you feel strange?

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Can't you see

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Senior Xian Qin likes Zhao Yan?

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother Luo and Senior Xian Qin

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
are both manly men

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's impossible

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They like each other

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Of course they like each other

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Zhao Yan looks at Xian Qin like this

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Senior Xian Qin looks at Zhao Yan like this

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is Senior Xian Qin

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the single-sided love

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
in the book?

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This

243
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is a big deal

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What's the big deal?

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you hungry?

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll take you to eat something

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll take you

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You clean up the machine

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's eat something delicious

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Then you take Xiao Yue to eat something delicious

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Come on, girl

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Boss, I want a horse-horseshoe cake

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
osmanthus cake

257
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:05,960
sesame candy, chestnut, and

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Zhuo

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Zhuo

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Zhuo

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I finally found you

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who are you?

263
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mom will cook you something delicious

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Take care

266
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't know you

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Go

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Zhuo

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's wrong?

270
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He caught me

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is my wife

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Zhuo

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because my daughter just passed away

276
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
a while ago

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She was shocked by the shock

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and lost her mind

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So she saw a girl of the same age

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and mistook her for Zhuo

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sorry

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Zhuo

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yao Fang, that's not Zhuo

285
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You mistook her for someone else

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's Zhuo

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Zhuo

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Look at me, Zhuo

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You don't know me anymore

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You don't know me anymore

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yao Fang, you really mistook her for someone else

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's not Zhuo

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Zhuo

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Zhuo

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to buy some steamed buns

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
and your favorite tofu

298
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't worry, I'm not going

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay

300
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ji Xing

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Give Zhuo the bowl

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What did you call me?

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ji Xing

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Here's the bowl

306
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Here's the bowl

307
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why are you so careless?

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You forgot which bowl Zhuo loves the most

309
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Wait, I'll get it

310
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll get it right now

311
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll get it

312
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your father is careless

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Here

314
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your mother loves you the most

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Zhuo loves this bowl

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your mother has been thinking about it

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Zhuo

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Zhuo

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's getting late

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why don't we go back first?

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If we come again

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
we'll have the cakes and the snacks at any time

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're welcome

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What did you say?

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Where do you want Zhuo to go?

326
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yao Fang, you forgot again

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Zhuo is married

328
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can't always go to your mother's house

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Married?

330
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're full of food

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What if I'm not here?

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're married

333
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm married

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's good

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's good

336
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Ice candy

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Ding Zhao, this cake

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
doesn't look delicious

339
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
on the street

340
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But it's delicious

341
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Really?

342
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is this how a mother feels?

343
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Maybe

344
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's come again next time, okay?

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't do this

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Senior

347
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There are so many people here

348
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Senior, please be more self-cultivating

349
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Be more self-cultivating, Senior

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you asking me to be more self-cultivating?

351
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Sir

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Look, I didn't see the dog

354
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
so I let it run from behind

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But don't worry

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll get it right away

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sit down

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Sit down

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Didn't Zhao Yan say she was tired and needed to rest?

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why are you here?

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And you're talking to a dog

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Enough, come out and see me

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Since we met here

364
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why don't we have a cup of tea together?

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Okay

366
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Senior, please

367
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I said, Zhao Yan

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How can you not even tell the dog and the dog's brain?

369
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Jin Zhao

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You said

371
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Jing An is so beautiful

372
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There are so many delicious things

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Why do people still believe in Qi Yuan Zong?

374
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Maybe they feel empty inside

375
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Empty?

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes

377
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Just like when you woke up three years ago

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You saw everything as if it were a layer of sand

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It had nothing to do with me

380
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But I've never felt that way

381
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because at that time you were a little idiot

382
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're the little idiot

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm not finished yet

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But fortunately, you little idiot

386
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're always by my side, bothering me

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I just gradually feel that it's good to have you by my side

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I take care of you every day

389
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't have time to think about it

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Otherwise, I must go to the temple

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
To fill my empty heart

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Okay, for the sake of your praise

393
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is for you

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Not hungry?

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is the sweetest piece

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I left it for you

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You actually give me delicious food?

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

400
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Something got on my mouth and feet

401
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When I got it before

402
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Didn't you always wipe it for me?

403
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that Brother Long and Xianqing?

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It really seems to be them

405
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Xiao Zhao Yan

406
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Actually you don't have to feel that you owe me

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sorry

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry

409
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sorry

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
After all, I took over your power for more than twenty years

412
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And even caused you to be seriously injured

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm willing to pay all the money

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I promised you

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I won't take the matter of life and death out of the way

416
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I heard everything you said

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Qingzhao

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is it not good for us to peek like this?

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't talk nonsense

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
We are just friends

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you know?

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Look

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I probably have something to do

424
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm leaving

425
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Senior

426
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Xiao Zhao Yan still has to go to the temple

427
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm going to go to the temple

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll go with you

429
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll go with you

430
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll go with you

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll go with you

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll go with you

433
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Xiao Zhao Yan still wants to hide from me?

434
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I thought we had made it clear

435
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not hiding from you

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Then why are you in the chicken feet hall

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So anxious to go

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Or did you say Xiao Zhao Yan

440
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Didn't treat me as a friend

441
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
How could it be

442
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Senior is naturally my friend

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then be friends with the demon

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Xiao Zhao Yan is not afraid to spread it out

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Damage to the Luo family

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Senior

447
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
As a friend

448
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You don't have to say that again

449
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It seems that you can't invite Xiao Zhao Yan

450
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Go to the sunset

451
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm leaving

452
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They left

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We are hurrying up

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You go with Xian Qing

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I go with Zhao Yan

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Then don't walk alone

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It doesn't matter that you walk alone

458
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Anyway, you'll find me

459
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Go

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We are going to the temple

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The temple is also very beautiful

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You are so beautiful

463
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's so beautiful.

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Senior Qin Qing.

465
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Qin Zhao.

466
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,000
Why aren't you with Xiao Yue?

467
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Aren't you afraid that Xiao Yue will be like a fish in the water

468
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
and the bird will return to the forest?

469
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Can't you find her?

470
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
I have a connection with Qi You.

471
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Even if I let her run to the end of the world,

472
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
I can still find her.

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
But when you look at the sunset together,

474
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,000
if you don't make it clear,

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
people won't understand.

476
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,600
Is Xiao Qin Zhao eavesdropping on my conversation with Xiao Zhao Yan?

477
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Not at all.

478
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,600
She's just passing by.

479
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Zhao Yan, what a coincidence.

480
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
What a coincidence, Miss Yue.

481
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
Why are you here?

482
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,000
I...

483
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,600
I think it's too hot in the Five Great Mountains.

484
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
Come and have some cold drinks.

485
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Miss Yue, why aren't you with Brother Yue?

486
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,200
I don't always want to be with him, do I?

487
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Miss Yue, have some tea.

488
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,600
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,200
It's okay.

490
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,800
Don't panic.

491
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,800
Don't panic.

492
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,000
I'll take care of it.

493
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Sit down first.

494
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Sit here first.

495
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Zhao Yan.

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,600
If I'm not wrong,

497
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,400
Brother Luo is a woman, right?

498
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
How did you know that?

499
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I've been with Brother Luo since we were together.

500
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
Except for the time of Feng Yan Yi,

501
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
Brother Luo would rather spend more money on Danjie

502
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,200
than to take a bath with us.

503
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
And when we were fighting,

504
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
a woman was the only one who was angry with him.

505
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,800
You have a crush on Brother Luo?

506
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,600
You can't hide your love for someone.

507
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Xiao Qingzhao can't hide his love for Yue either.

508
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Xiao Qingzhao.

509
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Senior, are you really...

510
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Yue is so curious.

511
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,200
So he learned it from Xiao Qingzhao.

512
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Hurry up.

513
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,000
You said Yue, and Yue is here.

514
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,800
What do you want?

515
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Senior, Senior, it's a big deal.

516
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,000
What's wrong?

517
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Did something happen to Zhao Yan?

518
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Zhao Yan is a girl.

519
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
I thought it was something.

520
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
How did you know?

521
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
Zhao Yan is not like you.

522
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
But he's like me.

523
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,600
You can't touch many things.

524
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Do you know that?

525
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

526
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,600
Let's go.

527
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Why did Zhao Yan become a boy?

528
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,200
How would I know?

529
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
You asked him yourself.

530
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
What about Mingxiu?

531
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,800
What do you think?

532
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Only Shi Fang and I know.

533
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,000
Jingzhao, you're too much.

534
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
You're a liar.

535
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
Senior, I've made the arrangements.

536
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,800
I've checked these people.

537
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Stinky Jingzhao.

538
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
You knew Zhao Yan was a girl, but you didn't tell me.

539
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
You knew Zhao Yan was a girl, but you didn't tell me.

540
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Senior Xianqing did too.

541
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,600
I just found out that it's all your fault.

542
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
It's none of my business.

543
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,200
Wait, wait, wait.

544
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
It's good that Zhao Yan is a girl.

545
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Otherwise, we would think that you like men.

546
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Do you like men?

547
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
You're talking nonsense.

548
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
Why are you talking nonsense?

549
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Let's go.

550
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Wait.

551
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,400
Senior.

552
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Change the shape.

553
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,200
Wolf demon.

554
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,800
Come on, there's a wolf demon.

555
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's take her away.

556
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Qian, let's go.

557
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Qianzu.

558
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Change the shape.

559
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,600
Let's go.

560
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,200
Let's go.

561
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Zhao Yan is over there.

562
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,000
Hurry up.

563
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Wait.

564
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Stop her.

565
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,600
Go.

566
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
Xianqing.

567
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,200
Chief.

568
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,400
Chief.

569
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
This is your blade?

570
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Zhenwu Alliance never fights with demons.

571
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Wolf demon

572
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,000
is not our guest.

573
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Chief, they're hiding the demon.

574
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,200
Let's take them down.

575
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,800
Go.

576
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Go.

577
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Go.

578
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,200
Master.

579
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
The King of Rains

580
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,900
Qian?

581
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,100
How are you?

582
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,200
Are you alright?

583
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
Senior Qianqian

584
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,600
Master Luo, Miss Ming

585
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,900
Are you going to be enemies with the Zhenwu Sect

586
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,000
and fight with the Wolf and Demon Sect?

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
Master Luo, Miss Ming

588
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,000
Kill the Wolf and Demon

589
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Master Luo, Miss Ming

590
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I knew Master Luo was a righteous person

591
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I will not allow anyone to hurt him

592
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Master, stop talking nonsense

593
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Brothers, attack

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Master Luo

595
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Master Luo

596
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Qian, find a way to get away

597
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Stop fighting

598
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Stop fighting

599
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Stop fighting

600
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Stop fighting

601
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Stop fighting

602
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Brother, stop fighting

603
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Stop fighting

604
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Stop fighting

605
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Chief, Chief

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Although Senior Qianqian is a demon

607
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
he has been helping us to track the Qiyuan Sect

608
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and saved us from the fire when we were in danger

609
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Chief, Senior Qianqian

610
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He is a good demon, Chief

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Shi Fang, move aside

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Chief, since the rule of the Zhenwu Sect

613
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
is not to fight with demons

614
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
we should leave

615
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Why do we need to hurt him?

616
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
If he is a demon

617
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
then don't think of leaving here today

618
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Don't think of hurting Senior Qianqian

619
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Take them all down

620
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Jinzhao

621
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Qi

622
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Jinzhao

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hurry up and go to the front

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Go

625
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, no, no

626
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I can't run anymore

627
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I can't run anymore

628
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I can't run anymore

629
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Jinzhao

630
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Zhao

631
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I've got you all in trouble

632
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Don't say that if you are brothers

633
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'll go to the front

634
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Lan, take your time

635
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You guys protect Xianqing

636
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'll go too

637
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'll make sure to get you to take Xianqing away

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Are you willing to fight with demons?

639
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We still have the strength to say that now

640
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Shi Fang has told us about your identity

641
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So you are my brother already

642
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's go

643
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Put me down

644
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Let's go

645
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Go and find Xiao Yue

646
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Go, Yue

647
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm still here

648
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Come

649
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Here, go

650
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Be careful

651
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Little Zhao Yue

652
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm worried about you

653
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What are you talking about, Senior?

654
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:15,960
【

655
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Master

656
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I should not hurt Xianqing

657
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

658
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,000
yapian longhua

659
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,280
what do you want

660
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
All the mistakes and memories are about you

661
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
All the reincarnations are like the years missing you

662
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

663
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The past is a scene, how many tears of smiles

664
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
All for happiness

665
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm looking for the mountains and rivers

666
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
The lonely mountain and the lonely rain

667
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
The city is quiet, your figure is dense

668
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The rain is endless

669
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm crying this year

670
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

671
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
The rain slowly rolls over your heart

672
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Don't doubt my heart

673
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm always like this

674
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
When the wind rises, the rain stops

675
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Waiting for the long-lost memory

676
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Waiting for me and you to get closer

677
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Look at the north star

678
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Heartbeat is silent

679
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The story has no trace

680
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All the mistakes and memories are about you

681
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
All the reincarnations are about you

682
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

683
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The past is a scene, how many tears of smiles

684
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
All for happiness

685
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm looking for the mountains and rivers

686
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The lonely mountain and the lonely rain

687
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The city is quiet, your figure is dense

688
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The rain is endless

689
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'm crying this year

690
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

691

The rain slowly rolls over your heart

692
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Don't doubt my heart

693
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm always like this
