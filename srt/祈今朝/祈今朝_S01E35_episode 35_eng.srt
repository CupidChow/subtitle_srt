♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12

20
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,634
Jinzhao, you're badly injured.

21
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:15,254
Don't worry. I won't die so easily.

22
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:23,154
Zhu Yu is trying to reestablish the connection with Mist Soul.

23
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,794
We can't let her succeed.

24
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:29,574
Otherwise, so many people would've died in vain.

25
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:37,894
Qi... everyone is waiting for us.

26
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:40,435
Everyone is waiting for us.

27
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:45,035
Jinzhao, leave it to me.

28
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:04,135
Give up. You can't possibly beat me.

29
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:11,420
 My thoughts are about my duty as a sword-wielder. 

30
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,279
 I already understand, 

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,355
 my thoughts are about people who risk their lives for mankind.

 My thoughts are one thought in one life and one thought for one person. 

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,360
 It's an ever-constant affection.

♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

Come.

53
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:52,655
My daughter,

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,561
do you really want to kill your mother?

55
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,395
Qi!

56
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,880
What have you done to her?

57
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:07,474
Qi, hurry and wake up!

58
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:10,015
Don't be deceived by her!

59
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:44,195
Qi, you must wake up.

60
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:47,035
Everyone is waiting for you.

61
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,454
You have to wake up.

62
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,860
 This is Zhu Yu's sea of awareness. 

63
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:13,535
I won't be confused by you.

64
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,920
Zhu Yu.

65
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:08,114
Qi... you did very well.

66
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:45,454
 Your name is Qi. 

67
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:49,675
 Qi means "pray". 

68
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,395
 I hope you'll be happy and safe 

69
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:54,915
 and that all is well for you. 

70
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,039
Mother.

71
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,294
Xian Qing.

72
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
Xian Qing?

73
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,634
Xian Qing?

74
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,155
Xian Qing?

75
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,135
Xian Qing?

76
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:24,814
Xian Qing?

77
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,035
Xian Qing?

78
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
Xian Qing?

79
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Xian Qing?

80
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,235
Xian Qing.

81
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Xian Qing...

82
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Xian Qing...

83
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,600
If you continue to cry like this, you're going to drench my fur.

84
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,300
Xian Qing?

85
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,914
Xian Qing?

86
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,675
Xian Qing!

87
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,900
I promised you I wouldn't die,

88
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,400
so I definitely won't.

89
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,900
I can't catch my breath.

90
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:39,295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

91
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:10,155
 Did they... succeed? 

92
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,900
Jinzhao, you...

93
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,700
I'm fine.

94
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,100
I'm really fine.

95
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,900
Qi, it's over.

96
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,300
Smile.

97
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Jinzhao, my Thought Sword originates from my thoughts.

98
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,400
I've changed my thoughts.

99
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
So the power of the Thought Sword has changed, too.

100
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,500
Zhu Yu fell asleep.

101
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We did it.

102
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,700
You found a way to make it work.

103
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,200
You fulfilled a sword-wielder's duty.

104
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,600
Qi, it's the Qixi Festival.

105
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,600
Let's go to Jing'an.

106
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:57,054
Okay. Let's go to Jing'an.

107
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Miss Ming?

108
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Young Xiu.

109
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,500
We're over here.

110
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,700
I'll take you home.

111
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:46,400
I know you are worried about Xiaoyuan, and you're sad and blaming yourself.

112
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
This...

113
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:53,994
is...

114
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,300
the first time you've held me.

115
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,800
Although...

116
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Although the world thinks...

117
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,200
you are cold and heartless,

118
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,000
I know...

119
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:37,934
very well that...

120
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:47,894
your heart... is the warmest.

121
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
Qingfei,

122
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,600
I'll take you back to the room for treatment.

123
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Qingfei?

124
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,200
Qingfei.

125
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Don't waste it.

126
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
Eldest Brother,

127
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:22,855
I hope that... this time... we'll win.

128
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:31,000
It's because... we've already given too much.

129
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,300
I hope...

130
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,800
that when all this is over,

131
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,500
you can really let go of the heavy burden on you,

132
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,920
and together...

133
00:20:55,474 --> 00:20:57,835
together...

134
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,700
Qingfei?

135
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Don't fall asleep, Qingfei.

136
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,000
 If you fall asleep, 

137
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
 it might be hard for you to wake up again. 

138
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 Jinzhao, 

139
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,700
 it seems we've done something quite remarkable together. 

140
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,400
 Of course. 

141
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
 Peace has been restored to the world. 

142
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,000
And the common people can now live happily ever after.

143
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,900
Qi,

144
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,500
what do you want to do in the future?

145
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Of course, it's to continue adventuring through the world with you.

146
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,700
Now we have money.

147
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,100
In the future, we can have egg noodles with lots of eggs.

148
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,234
You only care about eating.

149
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,400
Qi,

150
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
in the future, you'll see many landscapes...

151
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
and meet many people.

152
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,000
You should always remain this happy.

153
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,300
If we get tired, we can rest on Mount Yuqing and visit Ming Xiu and Uncle Gu.

154
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,800
If we get cold, we can visit Zhaoyan and Xian Qing.

155
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,600
Xian Qing's wolf fur must be very warm.

156
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,995
Qi...

157
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,300
I want to eat candied haws.

158
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,900
I used to always buy them for you.

159
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,500
Can you...

160
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,100
buy them for me once today?

161
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Okay. I'll go buy them for you.

162
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,700
Wait here for me.

163
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay.

164
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
All right.

165
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,200
♫  After autumn comes spring, in the end everything falls  ♫

166
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:17,800
♫  The sun rises, the moon sets, can they give you a tender answer?  ♫

167
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
♫  Under the Chinese parasol tree, the raindrops pitter-patter  ♫

168
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,900
♫  The branches break in exchange for memories  ♫

169
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,400
♫  Like silk threads, weaving into mist in the painting  ♫

170
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,200
♫  And into rainbows that worry and care  ♫

171
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,400
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

172
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,600
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

173
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,200
♫  Accompanying you through the ups and downs, following you blindly, enduring it silently  ♫

174
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,000
♫  Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  ♫

175
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,100
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

176
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,300
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

177
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,900
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

178
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:32,700
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

179
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,300
Qingfei? Qingfei?

180
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:15,235
Qingfei,

181
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,200
quickly wake up.

182
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,700
I don't have much time left.

183
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:25,594
 - This is... 
 - A birthday gift. 

184
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
 These two seem to be one. 

185
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,700
♫  A preface to the sorrowful wind, the snow falls, parting us  ♫

186
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,900
 Jinzhao, I'll stay with you forever. 

187
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,000
♫  Piercing deep into my heart, it tears at me  ♫

188
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,700
♫  Instead why not take my doomed fate away  ♫

189
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,300
♫  The mirror reflects the shadows but remains invisible  ♫

190
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,200
♫  Like those hidden emotions, icy and piercing  ♫

191
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
♫  Using the lightest words  ♫

192
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,300
♫  To make the harshest decisions  ♫

193
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:19,000
♫  No different from a death sentence  ♫

194
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:26,298
♫  If you truly can bear to leave with the wind  ♫

195
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:30,800
♫  How come tears suddenly shimmer in your eyes?  ♫

196
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
 There, now the pendants are a matching pair. 

197
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,800
 From now on, no matter what happens, 

198
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I'll always be by your side, 

199
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,300
 facing things together. 

200
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,800
♫  If the flowing water and fallen flowers are all fate  ♫

201
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,400
♫  Don't talk about who failed love  ♫

202
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,000
♫  If our next meeting is uncertain, don't eavesdrop on me in my dreams  ♫

203
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,900
♫  In the dream, humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

204
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,400
♫  In the dream, humming that tune of lovesickness  ♫

205
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Sister Ming Xiu.

206
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
What are you doing?

207
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,800
I was thinking that it's Jinzhao's and my birthday,

208
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
and we should eat egg noodles.

209
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,200
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

210
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,694
You've already said that many times.

211
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,900
But do you really understand what death means?

212
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,600
Death is the loss of life.

213
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,300
It's when the soul leaves the body.

214
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,000
It's something that everyone will ultimately experience.

215
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,400
Then repeat after me.

216
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,800
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

217
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,600
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

218
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,300
Say it again.

219
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,400
- Jinzhao is already dead. 
 - Again.

220
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't want to.

221
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,300
Yue Jinzhao is already dead!

222
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,200
Miss Ming, stop.

223
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:22,475
If she can't accept the fact that her loved one has passed away,

224
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,000
how is she supposed to go on living?

225
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,600
Even the one we thought would always spoil her is gone.

226
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,500
How much longer can we accompany her?

227
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:38,795
If, one day, we're no longer here,

228
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:41,674
what is she to do?

229
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,100
- Miss Yue... 
 - Jinzhao has already died.

230
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
I know.

231
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,900
Doesn't everyone ultimately die anyway?

232
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
Why don't you get some sleep?

233
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,380
Jinzhao, I'm so hungry.

234
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,435
Didn't you want to eat noodles?

235
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,475
Today is your birthday. Eat up.

236
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,700
Do they not taste good?

237
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,100
That's good.

238
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,000
We were worried they wouldn't suit your taste.

239
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,100
They're tasty.

240
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,300
I've never had noodles this delicious before.

241
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,200
The noodles are soft, yet not mushy.

242
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,400
The first time Jinzhao cooked noodles,

243
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,300
he cooked them for so long that they nearly turned into porridge.

244
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,000
Later, when he made noodles, they were always undercooked.

245
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,000
And the vegetable leaves are green.

246
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,100
The noodles Jinzhao cooked for me had yellow vegetable leaves in them.

247
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:31,395
I said they wouldn't taste good like that.

248
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,800
The next time he served me noodles,

249
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,200
he just quickly blanched the leaves.

250
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,200
This egg is still runny in the center.

251
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,000
This is my favorite way to eat eggs.

252
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,000
But Jinzhao never cooked them like this for me.

253
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,200
He said he was afraid it'd give me a stomach ache.

254
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,100
I think he just didn't know how to cook them.

255
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,600
What's wrong?

256
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
Nothing.

257
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,900
I just ate too quickly. I feel a bit uncomfortable.

258
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,700
- Then stop eating them. 
 - No.

259
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,800
Jinzhao told me not to waste food.

260
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
They're really delicious.

261
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm done.

262
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,400
There's something on the corner of your mouth.

263
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,800
On the left corner.

264
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,800
♫  What couldn't be felt  ♫

265
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,600
♫  What we thought would be forever  ♫

266
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,400
♫  Turned out to be fleeting  ♫

267
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:23,954
 Slow down. 

268
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,800
♫  The more desperately we tried to hold on to together  ♫

269
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,500
 Look at you. It's all over your mouth. 

270
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,000
 What if I'm not around in the future? 

271
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,800
♫  People say oaths burn to ash  ♫

272
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,400
So this is what death is like.

273
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,600
♫  Why do the sudden memories overflow into tears  ♫

274
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,800
It means that person...

275
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
is gone forever.

276
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,000
When Shifang died,

277
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,600
I felt like there was a hole in my heart.

278
00:38:04,895 --> 00:38:07,554
After Zhu Yu fell asleep,

279
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,200
I felt the hole in my heart grow even larger.

280
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,300
But now,

281
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,800
it feels like I don't even have a heart anymore.

282
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,500
♫  People say oaths burn to ash  ♫

283
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,200
He'll never call me a fool again.

284
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
He'll never pat me on the head again.

285
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,900
Or call me Qi again.

286
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,100
If you're sad, just have a good cry.

287
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,400
Jinzhao is no longer here.

288
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Who am I supposed to cry for?

289
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,600
Zhaoyan. Sister Ming Xiu.

290
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Look, I'm not crying anymore.

291
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,800
Thank you for celebrating my birthday.

292
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,200
These past few days, I've caused you trouble.

293
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,900
You two should rest first.

294
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm going to go see Ying Xuwei.

295
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,490
She should...

296
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,300
be stronger than we thought. Right?

297
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,200
But I'm a bit afraid.

298
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Are you crying?

299
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,700
Who's crying?

300
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,200
Your eyes are all swollen.

301
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,400
That... That's because I didn't sleep well last night.

302
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Besides, your eyes are much more swollen than mine.

303
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,200
I also cried just now.

304
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't want to talk to you.

305
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,600
Xiaoyuan.

306
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,000
Are we close? Call me Leader Qili.

307
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,400
Once you've cried, you shouldn't cry again.

308
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
You need to grow up.

309
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
What's so good about growing up?

310
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,300
Eldest Brother and Second Sister are both so badly injured.

311
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,900
Third Brother is dead!

312
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
No one can stay a child forever.

313
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,900
If someone could always remain a child,

314
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,100
it's because someone else is bearing the burdens

315
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,914
that she should carry herself.

316
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,861
I don't need you to tell me that!

317
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,200
 Yue Qi, I want the power of Rehai. 

318
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:28,010


319
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,000
♫  Twinkling stars, dotting the surface of the lake  ♫

320
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
♫  Twinkling stars, dotting the surface of the lake  ♫

321
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,100
♫  The bright moonlight illuminates your tender eyes  ♫

322
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,900
♫  The bright moonlight illuminates your tender eyes  ♫

323
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,300
♫  Hearing the gentle heartbeat by my ear  ♫

324
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,900
♫  I make a promise deep in my heart  ♫
