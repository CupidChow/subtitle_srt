1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:23,000


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,900
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,000
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,500
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,600
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,500
   

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
   

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,700
I've seen this...

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,500
Can Zhu Yu absorb the Qiyuan Orbs like Miss Yue?

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,700
Apart from Young Yue, the only one who can do it is...

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Lord Ming.

24
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Brother Yue, what should we do?

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Let's go talk to Uncle Lin Yuan.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
He's an upright person.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
Perhaps he'll be able to tell us something.

28
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,400
Shifang, you wait here for Qi.

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,100
Young Yue.

30
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,100
You were looking for me?

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,400
Uncle Lin Yuan. Zhu Yu is Lord Ming, yes?

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,900
You saw the soul fish, didn't you?

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Yes, Her Lordship is Lord Ming.

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
How is the Sea of Clear Skies related to the Qiyuan Sect?

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
How did you find out?

36
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,439
It seems there really is a connection.

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,200
Qi has already recorded everything about the Yujie Hub.

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,400
Since she is your young lord,

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
why did you send her to the Yujie Hub?

40
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,600
This is a long story.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,900
That's okay. We have time to hear it.

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,800
Okay, come with me then.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,200
I just want the truth.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Are you ready to face the harsh truth?

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
Just tell me.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,700
It's a very long story.

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
Come.

48
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,200
The Sea of Clear Skies was far more beautiful and prosperous than it is now.

49
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Until that disaster.

50
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
What disaster?

51
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,279
It was after the disaster, that we came to know...

52
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
that for over a hundred years,

53
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
we had always been living on the back of a Kun.

54
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,300
It's just unfortunate,

55
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
the Kun woke up.

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,000
The Kun... is Zhu Yu.

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,700
In its lifetime, a Kun must evolve.

58
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,400
And its process

59
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,200
will be painful due to drastic changes in a short period, it could even die.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,200
The Mist Soul can delay time.

61
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,600
Therefore, for generations,

62
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,300
they have relied on the Mist Soul to slow down time,

63
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,400
delaying the process of evolution to lessen the suffering.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
But it was when I was going to evolve,

65
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,900
that I discovered that the Yu Clan was living on my back.

66
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,500
And my evolution

67
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,300
almost caused a catastrophe for the Yu Clan.

68
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,900
I couldn't watch the Yu Clan perish.

69
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,500
So,

70
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:44,059
while using the Mist Soul to slow down the evolution,

71
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:49,400
I drew spiritual power from the Nine Springs to heal the Yu Clan.

72
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,500
But doing that will unbalance the spring veins, causing a catastrophe in the Six Realms.

73
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
Everything you have said is right.

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,000
But after it becomes unbalanced, it'll recover quickly.

75
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
Quickly?

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,000
I heard from Uncle Gu that it takes over 100 years for spring veins to recover.

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,320
Qi,

78
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,200
we are Kun.

79
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,800
A hundred years is merely one-thousandth of our lifespan.

80
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,900
But for humans, 100 years is the length of a lifetime.

81
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,040
What you just said,

82
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,700
sounds just like Ying Xuwei.

83
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
The key ring lit up.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Could there be a spring here, too?

85
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,080
That's right.

86
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,600
It's the Mist Soul.

87
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,279
Mist Soul is right there.

88
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,700
   

89
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
Whenever I see a spring,

90
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm always amazed by the wonders of creation.

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,000
We, Yu Clan, should've been wiped out in the last calamity.

92
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,200
Our queen, Ling Ye, used her last bit of strength to stop the ascension of the Kun.

93
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,599
And then, the Kun took her corporeal form

94
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,700
and became the new lord.

95
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
Who are they?

96
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,800
Them?

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,600
They're all severely injured clansmen in the last calamity.

98
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Her Lordship has been healing them, hoping that one day

99
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
they'll wake up.

100
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,300
They... look like humans.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,600
I understand now.

102
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,499
Because of the Mist Soul, you established a connection with the Hengdao Sect.

103
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:32,700
Ying Xuwei...

104
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,600
You indeed have a connection with the Hengdao Sect.

105
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,700
During the Bloodbinding of the Mist Soul, Ying Xuwei found me.

106
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:49,170
He advised me to use the Mist Soul to lead the Yu Clan into a time stasis.

107
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Time stasis?

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Does it mean to lock you up?

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Pretty much.

110
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,500
He put us in a place where time has nearly stopped.

111
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,000
Then they would find ways to heal the Yu Clan.

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What happened after that?

113
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,239
Later, we reached an agreement.

114
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,700
They would gather enough Vitality Energy to heal the Yu Clan.

115
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,300
After the Yu Clan was healed,

116
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,100
I would break the Bloodbinding of the Mist Soul.

117
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,441
Vitality Energy?

118
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,900
Could it be...?

119
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,100
- Then... 
 - That's right.

120
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,600
Ying Xuwei found and supported the growth of a small sect in the Mortal Realm.

121
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,900
He sent them to search for the Qiyuan Orb.

122
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,200
So I could absorb the Vitality Energy to heal the Yu Clan.

123
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
 Zhu Yu. 

124
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,500
Turns out... you really are Lord Ming.

125
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,500
You harmed so many people!

126
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You sacrificed the lives of so many humans!

127
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,100
But I have no choice, I can't just watch the Yu Clan perish.

128
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,500
The lives of the Yu Clan matter. Don't the lives of humans matter, too?!

129
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Everything is in the past already.

130
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,500
And the past cannot be changed.

131
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
Zhu Yu,

132
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,500
let me ask you one more thing.

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Why did I grow up in Yujie Hub?

134
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,500
You're right.

135
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
The Hengdao Sect had a deal with us, but they were still worried.

136
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,100
They want to take the newborn lord as a hostage

137
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,400
to control the ruler of the Sea of Clear Skies.

138
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,500
You made Qi a hostage?

139
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,700
What about me then?

140
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,800
Why is my memory completely blank?

141
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,200
Young Yue, your identity is a secret.

142
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,000
If you go on, I fear you'll be in danger.

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
Why be so persistent about it?

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Where is the Hengdao Sect?

145
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
I don't know.

146
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,800
It's always Ge Qingfei, the Second Leader of the Hengdao Sect who has been in contact with us.

147
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,300
Okay.

148
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,700
If you won't tell me, then I'll find another way.

149
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,719
Turns out,

150
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
to the Hengdao Sect,

151
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm nothing more than a hostage to threaten you with.

152
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,400
- I... 
 - Those happy days

153
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,200
were nothing but an illusion.

154
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,600
What about Jinzhao?

155
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,200
What does he have to do with Yujie Hub?

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Qi, stop asking.

157
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I don't want the truth to hurt you. Okay?

158
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,500
- Stop asking. 
 - I can bear the pain.

159
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Zhu Yu,

160
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,000
to me, Jinzhao is the person I care about the most in this world.

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Why do you always hide things and deceive me about him?

162
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,379
You still don't want to tell me. Right?

163
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,660
Fine.

164
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,300
If you don't tell me, I'll find the answers myself.

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't know if I'll have a chance to see Miss Shuo Xuan again?

166
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Miss Shuo Xuan.

167
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
What are you doing here?

168
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm waiting for Young Yue.

169
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
She's also here?

170
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,500
Miss Shuo Xuan.

171
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Well... I apologize to you.

172
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,100
I don't eat fish anymore

173
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,959
Miss Shuo Xuan!

174
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,199
Is there anything else?

175
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,460
I...

176
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,500
Last time, I bragged to you about becoming a hero.

177
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,600
Just forget it.

178
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,300
Right now... Right now, I no longer want to be a hero.

179
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,500
What happened...

180
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,400
to make you so self-aware?

181
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,640
A few days ago, a very kind senior died because of me.

182
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,900
Before that,

183
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I always told myself that I must be a great hero, a towering figure.

184
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,300
But... But the emergence of a hero often comes with many casualties.

185
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,400
So what? They aren't strong enough then.

186
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Otherwise, they'll have become heroes.

187
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,800
That's not it.

188
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,000
If being a great hero needs to sacrifice many lives,

189
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
then I'll give up being a hero.

190
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
You really are strange.

191
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
Miss Shuo Xuan!

192
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,100
The Luban lock I gave you...

193
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,900
I threw it away.

194
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,600
Shifang, stop watching.

195
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,300
She's left already.

196
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,900
Every time you see her, she's mean to you.

197
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,200
Why do you like her?

198
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Miss Shuo Xuan...

199
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,100
seems like she's never confused.

200
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,600
She always walks straight ahead,

201
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
completely different from me.

202
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,700
She's dazzling.

203
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
Girl.

204
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,800
Are you interested in that guy?

205
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,640
Impossible!

206
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:55,639
But... what are they here for?

207
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,900
They must have guessed our relationship with the Hengdao Sect.

208
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
They came to verify it.

209
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,900
So you told them everything?

210
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,000
I didn't say what shouldn't be said.

211
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,100
What is this feeling?

212
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,500
It's even more painful than absorbing the Qiyuan Orb.

213
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Your Lordship.

214
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,400
The young lord sent these pastries over.

215
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,200
   

216
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,800
"A Taste of Mom."

217
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,200
According to her friends, these are her favorite snacks in the Mortal Realm.

218
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,800
My sense of taste has almost disappeared.

219
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,100
If Qi finds it good, it must be good then.

220
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,419
Your Lordship, the young lord has regained her memory.

221
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:06,580
Before long... she'll know the truth.

222
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:11,179
I fear she can't handle the truth.

223
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,220
She also consumed the Qiyuan Orb.

224
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,900
Why hasn't she been consumed by the dark emotions of humans like me?

225
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,040
Compared to Your Lordship, the young lord consumed much fewer Qiyuan Orbs.

226
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,670
Besides,

227
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,870
Your Lordship, you're too lonely...

228
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,860
and tired.

229
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,499
Why does she have to leave?

230
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:47,199
Why is she unwilling to stay by my side?!

231
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,119
Your Lordship.

232
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,640
Why? Why?

233
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,630
Unwilling.

234
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,520
Resentment. Envy.

235
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,800
- Greed! 
 - Your Lordship!

236
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,020
These dark human emotions torment me incessantly.

237
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,559
Your Lordship!

238
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,639
I'm losing control. I'm losing control.

239
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,240
Your Lordship!

240
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,700
Your Lordship! Your Lordship! Your Lordship!

241
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,020
Your Lordship, calm down!

242
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,579
Selfish.

243
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,480
Greedy.

244
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,860
Unwilling.

245
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,760
Resentment.

246
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,690
Pain.

247
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,559
Girl, we're different from humans. So...

248
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,359
Oh no!

249
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,779
Your Lordship!

250
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,460
Your Lordship! Don't move!

251
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,899
Shuo Xuan!

252
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,300
Your Lordship!

253
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,679
- Your Lordship! 
 - Your Lordship!

254
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,000
Your Lordship!

255
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,679
Xi Luo!

256
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,679
Lin Yuan!

257
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,900
Help!

258
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,760
Hurry, save me!

259
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,830
Shuo Xuan!

260
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,080
Shuo Xuan!

261
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,120
Shuo Xuan. Shuo Xuan!

262
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,140
Shuo Xuan.

263
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,319
Girl! Meditation Spell!

264
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,339
Yes, use the Meditation Spell.

265
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,699
Your Lordship!

266
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,620
Shuo Xuan!

267
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,619
Your Lordship, don't blame yourself.

268
00:25:00,619 --> 00:25:03,379
General Lin Yuan and Shuo Xuan are both fine.

269
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:07,180
Luckily, Shuo Xuan has also learned

270
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,120
the Meditation Spell that every queen must master.

271
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,881
Mother.

272
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,560
Back then,

273
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,679
your mother, Ling Ye,

274
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,260
used the Meditation Spell to connect my consciousness.

275
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,860
Through her eyes, I saw the joys and sorrows of the Yu Clan.

276
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:46,099
Actually, I've always been aware of her existence.

277
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,720
But I never suspected it, I thought it was just a dream.

278
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,060
Until one day, my consciousness became warmer.

279
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,760
I couldn't help but get closer.

280
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,180
That day,

281
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,379
your mother gave birth to you.

282
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,939
Good girl.

283
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,820
You did very well.

284
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,319
You have inherited the spiritual power of the Yu Clan queens.

285
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,919
Now, you've mastered the Meditation Spell.

286
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,379
Come.

287
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,000
Good girl.

288
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,659
You're the future queen of the Yu Clan.

289
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,879
Your Lordship, in my heart, you've always been my mother.

290
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,040
I will always be by your side.

291
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,979
Qi, what's wrong?

292
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:05,880
Nothing. I suddenly feel a bit unwell.

293
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Sister Ming Xiu, I'm sorry.

294
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,440
Turns out Zhu Yu is the Lord Ming we've been looking for.

295
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:40,600
No need to apologize, Miss Yue. This isn't your fault.

296
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,200
That's right. Young Yue is also a victim.

297
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,699
I've found my origins and memories.

298
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:58,699
As for Jinzhao, Zhu Yu said the truth is too cruel.

299
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,120
She refused to tell me anything.

300
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,420
Lin Yuan was the same.

301
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,819
He said further investigation would endanger his life.

302
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,239
Brother Yue, what should we do next then?

303
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,680
Zhu Yu and Lin Yuan can't be fully trusted.

304
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,619
The closer I get to the truth of my origins, the more dangerous it is.

305
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,220
I've always been searching for my origins, and I'm not afraid of any dangers.

306
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,959
It's just... you all don't have to take the risk with me.

307
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,179
So...

308
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:41,180
Jinzhao, you're not feverish. So why are you being foolish?

309
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,879
Right. We've come this far. We should stay together.

310
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,399
We've shared life and death already. How can you say such things?

311
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,439
But Lin Yuan refused to tell us where the Hengdao Sect is.

312
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,360
Young Yue, you grew up in the Hengdao Sect.

313
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,479
Do you know where it is?

314
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,739
I only remember something called Yujie Hub.

315
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:06,999
It's a city in the sky.

316
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:12,739
Let's find a way to locate it then.

317
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,940
The Qiyuan Orb... can no longer satisfy me.

318
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,240
When I promised Ying Xuwei

319
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,479
to accept the Vitality Energy from the Qiyuan Orbs,

320
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:35,220
I've always known that sooner or later,

321
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,699
I would become lost in the dark human emotions.

322
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:44,479
But I can't stand it. I'm not willing to suffer.

323
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,260
I want to enjoy a happy time with my daughter.

324
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,939
Your Lordship.

325
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,199
There's news from the Mortal Realm.

326
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:59,160
The Luo family is auctioning a gemstone called Rehai.

327
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,199
A few days ago, a scout sent a message.

328
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,300
Ying Xuwei sent people to find out about the auction.

329
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,739
However, the progress is still unknown.

330
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:11,140
But before, Bian Luohuan once fell into the hands of the Luo family.

331
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,599
In that case, the Hengdao Sect has a connection with the Luo family.

332
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,139
What if... the Luo family spread the word just to lure Your Lordship there?

333
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:28,599
What do I have to fear?

334
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,219
Then I'll go with you, My Lord.

335
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,959
Jinzhao.

336
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,899
Jinzhao, does your eye hurt again?

337
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,779
This is...

338
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,300
Like Pureness, my left eye can also see visions of the future.

339
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,099
When I woke up three years ago, my left eye was already like this.

340
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,240
Every time I see visions of the future,

341
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,540
my eye suffers unbearable pain.

342
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,660
If there's any danger coming, or before something important happens,

343
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,060
his left eye can usually foresee it in advance.

344
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,079
Zhaoyan,

345
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,140
it was because of his left eye's guidance,

346
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,859
that we found you at Yinghui Fort.

347
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,319
Incredible.

348
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,099
What did you just see just now?

349
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,920
I saw Lang Mo, the one we saved in Luori Village

350
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,759
and the little girl swinging hammers at Fengyan Inn.

351
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,679
Previously, I didn't believe in the prophecies of my left eye.

352
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,099
But...

353
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,559
Brother Yue, if Lang Mo is in trouble, we still have to help him.

354
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,020
Yes.

355
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,799
I must find Bian Luohuan and ask about the purpose of Yujie Hub.

356
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,360
And what exactly is the relationship between you two?

357
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,739
I don't believe that you two are twin brothers.

358
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:25,120
Yeah.

359
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,920
Okay.

360
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,279
I'll find a disciple of the Luo family and search for Lang Mo.

361
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:42,939
Just now, Zhu Yu left the Sea of Clear Skies with Shuo Xuan.

362
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,920
They should be heading to the Luo Mansion.

363
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,799
It seems that the message we sent to Lin Yuan has started to work.

364
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,260
Now that Zhu Yu has begun to covet the power of Rehai,

365
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,940
that means she's not far from going completely mad.

366
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,719
We're bound to have a battle with the Sea of Clear Skies.

367
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:10,160
It's time to bring Qi and Yue Jinzhao back to Yujie Hub.

368
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,840
Young Master Luo.

369
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,800
It seems Commander Ying has been waiting for my message.

370
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:40,640
Zhu Yu is already headed towards Luo Mansion.

371
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,140
Today, we'll have to ask Young Master Luo to put on an act with me.

372
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,439
Yue Jinzhao and his company have gone to the Mangwan Village to look for Lang Mo.

373
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,760
Thank you for telling me.

374
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,099
Before the grand Luo family ceremony,

375
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,440
I don't want Zhaoyan to be there.

376
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,459
I will send someone to hold her back.

377
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:08,240
I'll wait for your good news then.

378
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,439
Qingfei, I'll go to Luo Mansion.

379
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:15,920
You go to Mangwan Village and restrain Luo Zhaoyan.

380
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,839
Bring Qi and Yue Jinzhao back to Yujie Hub.

381
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:20,480
Eldest Brother.

382
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,960
It's almost the 14th of July.

383
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,420
I don't have much time left.

384
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,079
It's my responsibility to bring them back.

385
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,259
Moreover, it seems Qi has regained her memory.

386
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:56,199
I want to see her.

387
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,420
Young Huan, don't joke.

388
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,840
 Eldest Brother! Second Sister! 

389
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,866
I will go with Third Brother.

390
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:12,820
All right.

391
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,260
Eldest Brother.

392
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,279
If Young Huan insists on going, why not let Xiaoyuan accompany him?

393
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:22,240
With Xiaoyuan's protection, we can be less worried. What do you say?

394
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,799
Eldest Brother, I can do it.

395
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,039
Xiaoyuan, it's important to complete the mission.

396
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,799
Keep your Third Brother safe.

397
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:37,859
Don't worry, Eldest Brother. I'll definitely protect Third Brother.

398
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,759
Let's set out.

399
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:19,640
Cang Feng.

400
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,319
Get ready for guests. Make two cups of tea.

401
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:24,340
- Yes.
- Wait.

402
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,360
Three cups.

403
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:42,010


404
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:09,940
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

405
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,909
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

406
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:18,366
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

407
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:25,869
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

408
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:29,780
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

409
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,827
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

410
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:42,732

♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

412
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:59,003
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

413
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:06,590
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

414
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:27,956
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

415
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:31,892
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

416
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:36,860
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

417
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:43,924
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:52,989
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫
