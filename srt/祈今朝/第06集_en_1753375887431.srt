6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I thought there was something strange in it.

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's just some ordinary materials.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The Qiyuan Sect's people have searched so many properties.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know how many people they have harmed.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is this stone for?

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master Lu, all heroes.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Heroes?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you calling us?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is there something wrong?

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Heroes,

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we will never forget the kindness of saving lives.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If we have a chance,

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
we will repay you with kindness.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No need.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Get up.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is our duty.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So this is what it feels like to be a hero.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you leaving?

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We have been missing for many days.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Our family must be worried.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now, we are lucky to have you all.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We should go back.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But you all came here after being attacked.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:23,120
There should be no more

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xiao Zhao Yan is the one.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Everyone, we found some treasures.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can take some money.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I will make up for it later.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thank you.

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thank you, hero.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you, hero.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This pearl is so beautiful.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to take a look.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you, hero.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Xiao Zhao Yan is indeed the master of Luo family.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't dare.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's the first time I heard you praise someone else.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Interesting.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yue Qi's case of being the master hasn't been solved.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now, there is a big trouble.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Man Ming, do you think he is the one who controls Qi Yuan Sect?

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why don't we take them to Luo family first?

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then we can investigate his background.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think it's better to go to Luo family first.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then we can investigate his background.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Cang Feng.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I have a feeling that this Doctor Bian will surprise you.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you want to say about Certificate?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When you scripts are out

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
she will bear the pain of this illness.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is true.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do you want to say about this?

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Cang Feng.

78
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Cang Feng.

79
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, I can't say so to you.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You are not my love anymore.

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I horrendously love you.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are still no longer beloved by me.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,300
Entrance program

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
07

86
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,820
I was nowاش

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
but you do Cross

88
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,840
outrageous

89
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
you

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The deep feeling behind the mask

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Only through the eyes

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who can see

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's destined to be me for you

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell you

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Unwillingly exchange a little bit of time

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Leave to love the unspoken promise

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's destined to be me for you

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell you

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Unwillingly exchange a little bit of time

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Leave to love the unspoken promise

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's destined to be me for you

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Even if the ending is hard to tell you

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Unwillingly exchange a little bit of time

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Leave to love the evidence

105
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know what the world is like

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is the sky blue in the world?

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is the cloud in the world white?

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What does the butterfly look like in the world?

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's so beautiful

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Master

111
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How about it?

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't open the bottom layer

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a butterfly

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How can the sky blue be bright?

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is it a little flower?

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:13,380
Dai Qi used the

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I saw the sky blue is bright

118
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you ok?

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Anxin, I'm ok

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your throat is already numb

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can't drink anymore

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm fine

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm fine

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm fine

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm fine

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm fine

127
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm fine

128
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm fine

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You said you're fine

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why do you use the resonance technique on this?

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I've been hit by the wall

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have to use the resonance technique to save her

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Xiao Huan, are you crazy?

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Before the dragon was born

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You said you were a person who used the golden flag and moon crystal to conquer the boss

136
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You are the one who has been against the law of the world

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If there is a violation, the law of the world will be eliminated

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Of course I will be able to

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I am her master

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What happened to her?

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Since she doesn't remember me

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How can I watch her suffer?

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then you use resonance technique on her

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Did anyone else see it?

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, don't worry

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I won't expose it

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Xiao Huan

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It is not easy to combine the moon crystal

149
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And I know my mission and responsibility

150
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I won't affect our plan

151
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I plan to

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I plan to find a chance to enter the Luo family later

153
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Find out the relationship between the Luo family and the hot sea

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You actually found the hot sea

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes

156
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I will go to the Luo family

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sister

158
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Xiao Yuan

159
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Sister, when will third brother come back?

160
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Xiao Yuan, be good

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
As long as you listen to me, third brother will be back soon

162
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When he comes back

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I will let him make another hundred butterflies for me

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have something to talk with my boss

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You go and play for a while

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You left me alone again

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Boss

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Xiao Huan accidentally found out the hot sea

169
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He plans to go to the Luo family to test his skills

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ok, be good

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I know

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Anything else?

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Take care of yourself

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Xiao Huan

175
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
From the pulse

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There is no sign of poisoning

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Xiao Qin Zhao

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
When I was in Xiao Yue's room

179
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Did anything happen?

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I fell asleep when I was sleepy

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It seems that Xiao Qin Zhao also found it

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If so

183
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The antidote that can save Miss Yue is not strange on the Bian Luo Huan

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This strange thing

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The strange thing is that the people of Qiyuan Sect

186
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Why would they risk their exposure to save Xiao Yue?

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Could it be that Dr. Bian knew Xiao Yue before?

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Did I say something wrong?

189
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are right

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Qi has recently been called the master of Qiyuan Sect

191
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Bian Luo Huan is suspected of being the master and the holy blood

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The Bian Luo Huan risked his life to save Qi

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Between them

194
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Master

195
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It seems that a lot of things happened before we met

196
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Someone deliberately invited us to the site of Qiyuan Sect's Fu Jin Tang

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Qi absorbed the Qiyuan Pearl

199
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And was recognized as the master by the people of Qiyuan Sect

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We are also innocent about this

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Everyone

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Qi and I don't know our identities

203
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And we are still revealing this strange thing

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
These three years

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We have been looking for our identities

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you have clues, please let us know

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even if it is related to Qiyuan Sect

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Of course

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Are we all friends?

210
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There is no one in this world who is not secretive

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
As long as there is no evil intention, we are all friends

212
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Qin Zhao, we believe you

213
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why don't you take that Dr. Bian to the Luo family

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let the people of the Moai family check the bottom line

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's right

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This Bian Luo Huan is very powerful

217
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He should be a member of Qiyuan Sect

218
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then let's invite the army to enter the wave

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then I will invite Dr. Bian

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's rest here tomorrow

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We are ready to leave the city the day after tomorrow

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ok

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Dr. Bian

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Can I come in?

225
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Please come in

226
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Dr. Bian

227
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thanks to your help

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Miss Yue's injury has improved

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We plan to leave the city the day after tomorrow

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I have troubled you a lot these days

231
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So I specially invited you to visit our Luo family

232
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No problem

233
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I didn't help you with anything

234
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I did what I should do

235
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's just a guest

236
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Please don't refuse

237
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Then I will follow your order

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Then I will leave first

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Qin, you are awake

240
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How is it?

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I want to drink water

242
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Ok, come

243
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I am fine

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I am fine

245
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I am fine

246
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I am fine

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I am fine

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I am fine

249
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I am fine

250
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I am fine

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am fine

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How is it?

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Is there anything uncomfortable?

254
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Silly girl

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can just avoid that sword in the secret room

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why did you help Bian Luo Huan to return the sword?

257
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know

258
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I just think

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He feels like Jin Zhao Ning

260
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He is an important person

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We can't let him be the middleman

262
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I am not like him

263
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I am me

264
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You can't compare me to him

265
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you hear me?

266
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Look at you

267
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He is fine

268
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But you have to suffer

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But if it wasn't for Dr. Bian

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He would have died

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Although I don't understand

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why people are afraid of death

273
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But Jin Zhao Ning said

274
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Life is a precious thing

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Only once

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Like what Zhao Yan said today

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Even the life of the enemy

278
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Can't be lost

279
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You didn't say that before

280
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It seems

281
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It seems

282
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But what Zhao Yan said

283
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It must be right

284
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes, Zhao Yan is right

285
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You don't listen to what I say

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Right?

287
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Jin Zhao

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I dreamed about you just now

289
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Me?

290
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes, I dreamed about you

291
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You gave me a beautiful butterfly

292
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I gave you a butterfly?

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes, in my dream

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Although there is only half a face

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I still recognized it

296
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't open the bottom layer

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You gave me a beautiful butterfly

298
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Put it under the stone box

299
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Wait for me to open it

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Come

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Using a butterfly

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,600
How do you behave?

303
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,280
Hey.

304
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,720
What about you?

305
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,600
We are brothers.

306
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,240
Oh my god.

307
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,800
You always this way.

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
You are my brother.

309
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
I changed my mind.

310
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,200
Our lives are in your hands.

311
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,360
Butterfly.

312
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,680
How can a man do that?

313
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,600
Jinzhao.

314
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,400
I finally found you.

315
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,280
Look.

316
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,360
This is the latest machine I developed.

317
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,800
Look.

318
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
This hand can move.

319
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:29,760
This one.

320
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,800
Shi Fang.

321
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
I'm busy today.

322
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm thinking about something.

323
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,640
Let's talk tomorrow.

324
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,600
What are you thinking about?

325
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,440
Tell me.

326
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,840
I can help you with the research.

327
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,240
Here's the thing.

328
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,720
I have a friend.

329
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Maybe he has a girl in his heart.

330
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
Can you understand?

331
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,000
I...

332
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,360
I understand.

333
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
You mean Zhao Yan?

334
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,320
What?

335
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,240
Zhao...

336
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
Zhao Yan.

337
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,120
A girl in his heart.

338
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,280
A friend.

339
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Isn't that Zhao Yan?

340
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
What?

341
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,320
Look.

342
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,080
Your friend.

343
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
Isn't that our group?

344
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,280
Who...

345
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,960
Who said I only have a few friends?

346
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Why didn't you say it?

347
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
I thought you had a girl in your heart.

348
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,560
A girl.

349
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,080
I...

350
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Jinzhao.

351
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,960
Don't talk nonsense.

352
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't talk nonsense.

353
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,480
Jinzhao.

354
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,280
Shi Fang.

355
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,600
Brother Luo.

356
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,920
You're here.

357
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,520
Brother Luo.

358
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,280
You're here at the right time.

359
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,000
We're talking about you.

360
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,560
What?

361
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,720
What are you talking about?

362
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,400
We're talking about a girl.

363
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,840
She told my friend

364
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,880
that she dreamed of me in her dream.

365
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,920
Her friend gave her a butterfly.

366
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Really?

367
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,360
Were we talking about this?

368
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,600
What do you mean?

369
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,960
I got it.

370
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,120
You mean

371
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,200
your friend

372
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
is a butterfly.

373
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,800
What?

374
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
I think she's hinting something.

375
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,560
Her friend.

376
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,360
Her expectation.

377
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,880
Expectation?

378
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,400
Yes.

379
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
Expectation.

380
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,440
You're the master of Luo family.

381
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,040
You're not only a young girl

382
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,240
but also a young man.

383
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,720
Good.

384
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,000
Shi Fang.

385
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
I remember you have a box

386
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,000
to open the mechanism.

387
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,840
Is it still there?

388
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,880
It's the box

389
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,800
that can control the box.

390
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,480
Yes.

391
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Can you show me?

392
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,080
You want to use my mechanism?

393
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,440
No?

394
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,080
Yes.

395
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,040
Of course.

396
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,760
Jinzhao.

397
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,040
I dreamt of a day

398
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,160
when you could use my mechanism.

399
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:21,960
Jinzhao.

400
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,680
Wait here.

401
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,480
I'll get it.

402
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,240
Okay.

403
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,040
Wait a minute.

404
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Okay. I'll wait for you.

405
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,240
Expectation for my friend.

406
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
You're like a mechanism in Shi Fang.

407
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You've figured out how to surprise Miss Yue?

408
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,920
How do you know?

409
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,400
Jinzhao.

410
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,600
Where are you taking me?

411
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,240
Here.

412
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,560
Okay.

413
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,640
Three, two, one.

414
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
So beautiful.

415
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,720
Jinzhao.

416
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,280
How did you find this?

417
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,400
Jinzhao.

418
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,080
Jinzhao.

419
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,360
Where did you find it?

420
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,640
I found it

421
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,760
so easily.

422
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,000
Why is it not fragrant?

423
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,320
Butterfly.

424
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Butterfly.

425
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,400
So many butterflies.

426
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,320
Look, Jinzhao.

427
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,040
Butterfly.

428
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,640
You're a bad guy.

429
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,240
You blew away my butterfly.

430
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,320
You're so mean.

431
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,000
You blew away my butterfly.

432
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,720
Jinzhao.

433
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,720
Where did you find it?

434
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,520
Right here.

435
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,400
What is it?

436
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,360
You've been working hard here?

437
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,520
You pick it up on your own.

438
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,280
What is it?

439
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,440
It's my business.

440
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,280
Okay.

441
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll pick it.

442
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,640
Hurry up.

443
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,240
Hurry up.

444
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,880
Hurry.

445
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,520
Hurry.

446
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,120
Great.

447
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Organization gatelist Ready.

448
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,760
Is that the star that you said

449
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
can be used to guide the north star?

450
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Even the stars can't be found at that moment.

451
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,240
What if my Qi Hou runs away?

452
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,760
Isn't it you?

453
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
You don't want to lose me, do you?

454
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Mr. Yue, is she really your sister?

455
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Your reaction is not like a normal brother.

456
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
What are you doing?

457
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
You can't do anything about it.

458
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Qi En,

459
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
who am I to you?

460
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
You are Jin Zhao.

461
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
No, I mean

462
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
you think I'm your brother

463
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
or what?

464
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
It's Jin Zhao.

465
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
What's wrong?

466
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Nothing.

467
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Yes, I shouldn't expect anything.

468
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
But it's good that you are not my brother.

469
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
It's getting cold. Let's go back.

470
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Okay.

471
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
Mr. Hai,

472
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
how long are we going to walk like this?

473
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Walk slowly.

474
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
We will arrive anyway.

475
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I can't walk anymore.

476
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
You really can't walk?

477
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Okay.

478
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Wait here. I'm leaving.

479
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I'm leaving.

480
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm leaving.

481
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
You are the best to me.

482
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I'm looking for you in the mountains.

483
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I'm lonely in the empty mountains.

484
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,480
I'm close to the city.

485
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
I'm fascinated by your figure.

486
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,480
I'll never leave you.

487
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,480
I'm looking for you in the mountains.

488
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,480
I'm willing to be with you forever.

489
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
The rain is slowly pouring into the sea.

490
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm looking for you.

491
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Don't doubt.

492
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm willing to be with you forever.

493
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I'm coming.

494
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Xiao Ye, it seems that you are recovering well.

495
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Dr. Bian's medical skills are really good.

496
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Dr. Bian saved me?

497
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Yes.

498
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Xiao Jinzhao, what's wrong with your leg?

499
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
I...

500
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
It's okay.

501
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
But it was because he walked a few steps behind me last night.

502
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
He must be pretending to be a fortune teller.

503
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Last night?

504
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
You have a good heart.

505
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
Of course I do.

506
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm not heavy.

507
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,480
You just walked a few steps behind me.

508
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,480
As for me, I must be pretending to be a fortune teller.

509
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,480
That's not necessary.

510
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Sister Mingxiu, save me.

511
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
Dr. Bian, why are you here?

512
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
Are you going with us?

513
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,480
Dr. Bian, thank you for saving me last night.

514
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,480
You woke up because of your powerful results.

515
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Moreover, you saved me yesterday.

516
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Since everyone is here, let's go.

517
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
The Stone of the Deceased

518
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
This stone is so magical.

519
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
It's like a island.

520
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
When the clouds come, it's the ancient time.

521
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,480
You can go anywhere you want to go.

522
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
The Stone of the Deceased

523
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Sister Mingxiu, what is this?

524
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
It's used to capture people's destination.

525
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Go.

526
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
Slow down.

527
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
The Stone of the Deceased

528
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Thank you, Dr. Bian.

529
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Thank you for saving our Jiaqi.

530
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,480
I'm jealous.

531
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,480
The Stone of the Deceased

532
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
I don't know what you plan to do in the future.

533
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,480
If you don't mind, please stay in my house for a few more days.

534
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
We're happy to do it.

535
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
No need.

536
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Since Uncle Shi is going to stay here,

537
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
I'll take a step ahead.

538
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Thank you, Master Luo.

539
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
When you left the mountain,

540
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Brother Han Jiang told you to make more friends.

541
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
He sent the worship post to Zhenwu Alliance.

542
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
He's not worried about it.

543
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,480
If you leave everyone like this,

544
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
he'll be sad.

545
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,480
I will never be friends with the person who is covering the monster.

546
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Sister Mingxiu is leaving?

547
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Xiu is like this.

548
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Don't mind it.

549
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,480
Everyone, let's go.

550
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Dr. Bian, please.

551
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
This time I entered the Luo family,

552
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
I don't know if I can see the Luo Wangbin I had in my sleeve.

553
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Surround Bian Luo Huan.

554
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
Yes.

555
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Your invitation to the palace

556
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
finally can't be held.

557
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
What's going on?

558
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Didn't Dr. Bian come to the Luo family with us?

559
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Did he come to visit the Luo family?

560
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Xiao Yue, Dr. Bian is likely to be related to Qi Yuan.

561
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Dr. Bian, is what he said true?

562
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Do you believe them or me?

563
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
I believe what you said.

564
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
So why is Miss Yue asking about this?

565
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Let's go.

566
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Qi, stop reading.

567
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
If it's really related to our background,

568
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
this is the best way.

569
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,480
This is the first time I care about another person.

570
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,480
I'm worried about you.

571
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,480
This is the first time I care about another person.

572
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Who is he?

573
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Maybe all the memories are about you

574
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,480
All the reincarnations are like the thought of missing you

575
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

576
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
The past is one scene, one scene

577
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
How many tears of smiles

578
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Will make happiness fall

579
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,480
I'm looking for you in the mountains and rivers

580
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,480
The wind blows alone and I am echoing

581
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
The silence of the city

582
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Your figure

583
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I can't leave you

584
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm crying for this year

585
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,480
I want to be with you for this life

586
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,480
The rain slowly rolls into your heart

587
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Don't doubt my heart is always like this

588
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,480
When the wind blows, the rain stops

589
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Waiting for the old memories

590
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Waiting for me and you to get closer

591
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Look at the north star

592
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Heartbeats are so sincere

593
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,480
The story has no trace

594
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,480
The color of the moon is wrong

595
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Write a memory

596
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,480
It's all about you

597
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,480
All reincarnations are like the thought of missing you

598
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

599
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,480
The past is one scene, one scene

600
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
How many tears of smiles

601
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Will make happiness fall

602
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,480
I'm looking for you in the mountains and rivers

603
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,480
The wind blows alone and I am echoing

604
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,480
The silence of the city

605
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
Your figure

606
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I can't leave you

607
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I'm crying for this year

608
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,480
I want to be with you for this life

609
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,480
The rain slowly rolls into your heart

610
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Don't doubt my heart is always like this

611
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,480
