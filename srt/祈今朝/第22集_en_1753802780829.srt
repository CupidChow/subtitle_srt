Episode 15

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Xianqing

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xianqing

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Come here

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Xianqing, take a rest

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll find out if there's medicine

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Changyin

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As long as you're here

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll be fine

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry, Xianqing

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's all because of me that you became like this

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're hurt so badly

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's okay

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's okay

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why did it happen?

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you hate him?

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He and I are the closest

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But he's the one who hurt us the most

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't worry

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll be with you forever

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll be with you forever

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Manming was locked up in the house today

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He said he found the way to get rid of his father

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The way to get rid of your father

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Our Luo family is cold and cold

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We bear the punishment of the heaven

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Manming and I have been suffering the same pain and suffering because of the dual curse

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But Manming has been suffering for over 200 years

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He hasn't been able to get out of the Luo family

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He will have a lot of resentment and hatred

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I owe him

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why do you think so?

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm willing to get rid of him

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But he doesn't want me

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He doesn't want me

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He doesn't want me

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He was the only one in my life

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He was the only one in my life when I met you

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He can't get rid of the prison in the Luo family

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So he wants to lock me up here

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I owe him

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's the Luo family

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Luo family is the only one in my life

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Your family is just a blessing to you

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xingyi

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are Luo Zhaoyan

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You are Luo Zhaoyan

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm Luo Zhaoyan

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm Luo Zhaoyan

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will only live for myself from now on

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will only live for myself from now on

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Manming

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Dad is dead

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We are the closest people

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I will protect you

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We will live together

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We will die together

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay?

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Manming

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
As long as you are willing

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I will be like before

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I will protect you like before

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Xiu'er

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Master

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you like it?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Xiu'er

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What do you want for lunch?

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stir-fried vegetables

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't want to eat stir-fried vegetables

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are a good boy

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The families I found for you before

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They are all good

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They are good to you

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't want to be adopted by them

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But you only eat stir-fried vegetables

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I hate monsters

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I hate people

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I only want you

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Silly boy

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There are good and bad things in the six realms

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can't be confused

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Master has a friend called Xianqing

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He often comes to eat and drink for free

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But he is good at cooking

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When he comes back

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let him cook for us

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Give Master a next sentence

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There was no fate book at that time

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I am still changing my fate

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I am sorry

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have figured out the fate book

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I underestimated you

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I didn't expect

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This guy is just a person

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Who will use illusions to judge people's hearts

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You are a pervert

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will judge people's hearts

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Next

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You won't have another chance

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then we will wait and see

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How to get in?

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It feels a little strange

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's okay

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You are here

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Another fate book

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I am not a fate book

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then what are you?

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My name is Suhe

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I am Longtan

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Longtan

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I heard that the whole eye has a shape

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I didn't expect Longtan to be a human shape

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I know your origin from memory

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can Longtan really be revived?

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The person who died

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't be revived

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I can only exchange

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
At the expense of the existence of the one who wishes

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Can create the life of the one who wishes

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The existence of the one who wishes

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What does this mean?

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The heaven and earth have a fixed number

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Can't increase

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If the heart has what it wants

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
For the sake of the future

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If the heart has what it wants

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Only the life of the one who wishes

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And all the memories related to the one who wishes

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
As a price

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Can reschedule the life of the one who wishes

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Isn't this a life for a life?

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And after exchanging

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The one who wishes is like it never existed

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is impossible

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The effects of the one who wishes will disappear at will

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Isn't this all messed up?

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The place of confusion will be corrected by the heaven and earth

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The traces of the one who wishes will naturally be covered by others

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So it means

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What that person does

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Will be done by other people in the airport

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And everyone will not feel wrong

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Exactly

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Jingzhao, if one day I have something

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You must not come to exchange me

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because I don't want to forget you at all

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't talk nonsense

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Miss Ming

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't draw

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If you exchange the life of Gu Senior

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then there will be no Mingxiu in the world

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Sister Mingxiu

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Even the traces of your existence will disappear

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The most important person can live well

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is the greatest comfort to the one who wishes

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
As long as the one who wishes is passed on

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The wishes and beliefs of the one who wishes

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Then the one who wishes is alive

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Got the continuation of life

171
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I will live as the continuation of Master's life

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then one day

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I will meet him again

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Sister Mingxiu

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can follow this decision

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You are so amazing

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Miss Ming

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No need to apologize

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You don't need to apologize

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Just everyone is Master's own decision

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I will not be able to live

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I will not be able to live

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will not be able to live

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I will not be able to live

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Everyone is Master's own decision

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Master can't hate you

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Then I will not hate you either

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Miss Ming

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Thank you

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you crying

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I love you

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll send you to leave

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's Yu Qingshan

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Where are Qingzhao and Xiaoyue

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Did Suhe not send them back

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Where did you get them

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I already know that you have another intention

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Master

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I really have another intention

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There is one thing

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I want to ask you

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You said that this is the place where all memories are

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There must be memories of me and Qi, right

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I want to know

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What is our past

209
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You can go to the memory pool by yourself

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But at the same time, you have to bear the pain of life

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you think about it

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm not afraid

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Qi

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Are you ready

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you going to make a wish to the sacred tree

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Just like the tree outside the moon temple

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's try

218
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The sacred tree, the sacred tree

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Please tell me all the memories three years ago

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Please let me find the memories

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The sacred tree

222
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Qingzhu

223
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Qingzhu, look, the sacred tree is coming

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
These are all your memories, right

225
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is this me

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It turns out that you looked like this when you were a child

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It looks pretty cute

228
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You are my old friends, right

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You are always together

232
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes

233
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I really want to see what he looks like when he grows up

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Grown up

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Jingzhao, this person looks like you

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is this me

237
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
With you

238
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
From childhood to adulthood

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is it me

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Jingzhao, these are the memories of the two of us

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't be angry

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't be angry

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't be angry

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't be angry

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't be angry

246
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Why is it not him

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
All of you

248
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Sister, what's wrong with you

249
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sister

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Who are you looking at

251
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sister, who do you want to see

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Jingzhao

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My memories seem to be back

254
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What about me

255
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Where am I

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't be afraid

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't be afraid

258
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't be afraid

259
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I finally remember

260
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You are the most beautiful

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But you are still the same

262
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I am a person who has a yearning

263
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
With you, the past is covered in snow

264
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Where am I

265
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Where are my memories

266
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't be afraid

267
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't be afraid

268
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Don't be afraid

269
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Who am I

270
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The struggle of being alone in my heart

271
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
For you, I don't have to leave the heart to share

272
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
With you, the past is covered in snow

273
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't be afraid

274
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't be afraid

275
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Young Master, Xianqing

276
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Are you feeling better

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I took the medicine left by Han Jiangxin

278
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I am fine now, don't worry

279
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Jingzhao, Xiao Yue

280
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You are finally back

281
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I will go back first

282
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Miss Yue, are you all right

283
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Something happened

284
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What about you

285
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Something happened to the Luo family

286
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I will tell you later

287
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How is Xiao Xiu

288
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
She is waiting for us

289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Miss Ming gave up on teaching Senior Gu

290
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Xiao Xiu never disappoints Han Jiangxiong

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Let's go

292
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go see him off

293
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's go

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Master

295
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Are you all right

296
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I am fine

297
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I am fine

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I am fine

299
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I am fine

300
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You are fine

301
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I am fine

302
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I am fine

303
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I am fine

304
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I am fine

305
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I am fine

306
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Suddenly,

307
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,560
Xiu found that she wasn't alone.

308
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,360
Those who have been with me

309
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,240
are friends that Master told me about.

310
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,360
But Xiu is stupid.

311
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
Now she knows

312
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
Master won't blame Xiu.

313
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Master.

314
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,360
I will live on with Master's heart.

315
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,760
I will protect Wuge.

316
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,080
Gu Qianbai.

317
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
I won't let you down.

318
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
You have to find your own way.

319
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,800
Xiu.

320
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,680
Let Han Jiang have a good rest.

321
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,280
Master.

322
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,520
I forgot.

323
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,520
Master.

324
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,640
Take a rest.

325
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,720
Gu Qianbai.

326
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
Be well.

327
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,880
I just thought of you.

328
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,960
But I was fried in the oil in Hongxi.

329
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,360
Jin.

330
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,200
I come in

331
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,960
Go.

332
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,720
I heard that you didn't find your memory

333
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,680
in the memory book.

334
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,440
You can't accept it.

335
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,320
Try it.

336
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,840
My memory

337
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,400
is nothing to me.

338
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,440
So what if I have it?

339
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,000
So what if I don't?

340
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,440
You're not going to talk.

341
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,680
Poor Han Jiang.

342
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,920
The order you borrowed from me

343
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,680
and the half-day's order

344
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,280
are all on you.

345
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,680
I'm sorry for you.

346
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
Now,

347
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
I can't even

348
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,600
be honest with you.

349
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,520
I can't do what he said.

350
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Fate.

351
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
You said fate is the proof.

352
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
But for you,

353
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,120
is it a lie?

354
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,320
I don't know where I come from

355
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
and why I exist.

356
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,760
You're a man of your word.

357
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,000
You need to know the fate of life

358
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
before you know the fate.

359
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,320
I don't even have the birth date.

360
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
How can it change?

361
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,560
How can it surpass?

362
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
Come with me.

363
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,320
In front of him,

364
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,080
say what you said just now again.

365
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
He once used his life to tell you

366
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,120
that no matter what kind of setback you encounter,

367
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,880
you have to move forward.

368
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't fall down.

369
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,160
Witness.

370
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,960
I won't die.

371
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Ms. Gu.

372
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,560
Who am I really?

373
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,120
Is there really

374
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,760
anyone who sided with?

375
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,440
who I really am...

376
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,400
You'll guard her at night!

377
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm sacred already.

378
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,340
What's wrong?

379
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,820
You look down on me, too?

380
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
You can't change the future.

381
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Even if the future is very early,

382
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
you still have Miss Yue by your side.

383
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
What are you afraid of?

384
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
With this money as evidence,

385
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
don't forget what I said today.

386
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
I understand.

387
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
No matter what happens in the past,

388
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
the future

389
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
is always in my hands.

390
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay.

391
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Since the heaven is not fair,

392
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
I will change my fate.

393
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
God Zai,

394
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
from now on,

395
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
I will never believe you.

396
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
I, Yue Jinzhao,

397
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
will go my own way.

398
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Come on!

399
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

400
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Come on!

401
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm not afraid of you.

402
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
I'm not afraid of you.

403
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm not afraid of you!

404
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm not afraid of you.

405
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,080
I will give up my whole life

406
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
for a change.

407
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,080
If I decide to take off my guard,

408
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,080
who will I give my heart to?

409
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you.

410
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
I don't want to be a loser.

411
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,080
I hope there will be no regrets in winter.

412
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
I don't want to be a loser.

413
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,080
I hope there will be no regrets in winter.

414
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Because you are the secret of the unanswered question.

415
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,080
So I will never touch you again.

416
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I will never leave you again.

417
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
I will try to

418
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
solve all the secrets.

419
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
I will try to

420
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
make myself more clear.

421
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Can you keep protecting me?

422
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I will be with you.

423
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,080
The Uncanny Counter

424
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Why are you staring at me?

425
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I was just surprised that you came here.

426
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
I thought you would stay in Mount Yuqin

427
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
to accompany Mr. Han.

428
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
Miss Yue and Mr. Yue

429
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
helped me to travel around.

430
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
I should accompany them.

431
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
I really grew up.

432
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
I know the importance of friends.

433
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
This is called a friendly relationship.

434
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
It's Soul Fish.

435
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
I want to see Zhu Yu.

436
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
His Majesty is not here today.

437
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
I am the young lord of the Sea of Heaven.

438
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
How dare you stop me?

439
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
I will go to see him.

440
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Zhu Yu.

441
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Zhu Yu.

442
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Zhu Yu.

443
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Zhu Yu.

444
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Zhu Yu.

445
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Zhu Yu.

446
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Zhu Yu.

447
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Please come.

448
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Zhu Yu.

449
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

450
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

451
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

452
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

453
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

454
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

455
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

456
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

457
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

458
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

459
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

460
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

461
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

462
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

463
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

464
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

465
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

466
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

467
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
You are the Lord of the Deceased.

468
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Deceased.

469
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,080
The star has a soul.

470
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
It's destined.

471
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Heartbeats are silent.

472
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Time is endless.

473
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
The color of the moon is wrong.

474
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Write a letter of memories.

475
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
It's all about you.

476
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,080
All the reincarnations are wrong.

477
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Everything is unforgettable.

478
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
It's hard to forget you.

479
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
Every moment,

480
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
every smile,

481
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
every tear,

482
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,080
they will all be happy.

483
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,080
I am searching for you in the mountains and rivers.

484
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
I am lonely in the mountains and rivers.

485
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I am looking for you in the city.

486
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I am looking for you in the city.

487
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I will never leave you.

488
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I am searching for you in this life.

489
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,080
I am searching for you in this life.

490
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
The rain slowly covers your name in the sea.

491
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Don't doubt that I am always like this.

492
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Waiting for the wind to stop and wait for the rain to stop.

493
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Waiting for the old memories.

494
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Waiting for me and you to get closer.

495
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Look at the north star.

496
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Heartbeats are silent.

497
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,080
The story is over.

498
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
The color of the moon is wrong.

499
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Write a letter of memories.

500
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
It's all about you.

501
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,080
All reincarnations are wrong.

502
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Everything is unforgettable.

503
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,080
It's hard to forget you.

504
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Every moment,

505
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
every smile,

506
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
every tear,

507
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,080
they will all be happy.

508
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,080
I am searching for you in the mountains and rivers.

509
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I am lonely in the mountains and rivers.

510
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
I am searching for you in the city.

511
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
I am searching for you in this life.

512
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
I will never leave you.

513
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,080
I am searching for you in this life.

514
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,080
I will never leave you.

515
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,080
The rain slowly covers your name in the sea.

516
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:03,080
Don't doubt that I am always like this.

517
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
I am waiting for you.
