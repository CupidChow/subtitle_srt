1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,200
I've torn up all my past memories,

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,480
leaving no regrets.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,560
I've given up my whole life

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,960
for another chance.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,160
If I decide to let go of my guard,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,880
who will I give my heart to?

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm not afraid of being destroyed.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,560
I don't want to be a burden.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,720
I hope there's no regret in this world.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,720
We have different paths.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,920
I have no regrets.

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,320
Because you are the secret of the undisclosed.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,160
So I pray for a miracle.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,800
I'll give my heart to you,

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,680
even if I'm burned out by time.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,640
I only wish to wake up for you,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,000
searching for a miracle that will last forever.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,560
I'll never leave you.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life.

Episode 9

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Senior.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Senior.

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Senior Xianqing.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Senior.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Senior, how is he?

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
He is badly injured.

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
I have to take him back to Mount Yuqing.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Okay.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Brother Luo, you should take care of Senior Xianqing.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Leave Jingzhao and Xiao Yuan to me.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Jingzhao.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Jingzhao.

36
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Jingzhao.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Jingzhao.

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Jingzhao.

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Second Brother, Third Brother, I didn't mean to hit them.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I didn't mean to kill them.

Jingzhao.

46
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Jingzhao.

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Jingzhao, you haven't recovered yet.

48
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Jingzhao.

49
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Qi.

50
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Let's go.

51
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
We should go to Fengyan Yi

52
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
and find Shi Fang.

53
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Let's go.

54
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Wait.

55
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I think I heard something.

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Someone else.

57
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Don't be so stupid.

58
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
It turns out that you two

59
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
are really wild boars.

60
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
You sent them to the door yourself.

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
You two were lucky to escape just now.

62
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Now your good luck has come to an end.

63
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
The last time we were lost and escaped

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
wasn't us.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I tell you.

66
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I stopped this water jade

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
because I wanted to set it free.

68
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Today, I'll see how you will be arrogant.

69

The Taoism Grandmaster

70
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
What kind of magic is this?

71
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Qi.

72
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Qi.

73
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Jingzhao.

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Jingzhao, how are you?

75
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm fine.

76
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Find a place to hide.

77
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Let Luo Xuan come and save us.

78
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
But...

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Go.

80
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Go.

81
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
How is it?

82
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Go.

83
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Jingzhao.

84
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Go.

85
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Jingzhao.

86
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Jingzhao.

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
This...

88
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Give me the magic spell.

89
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
The magic spell.

90
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
This woman is a magic spell.

91
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Calm down.

92
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Calm down.

93
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
It's easy to see when you become a human.

94
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Right?

95
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Let's retreat for now.

96
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Go.

97
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Go.

98
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Go.

99
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Go.

100
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Jingzhao.

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Jingzhao, wake up.

102
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You're awake.

103
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Jingzhao.

104
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Jingzhao.

105
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Jingzhao.

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Jingzhao.

107
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't scare me.

108
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Jingzhao.

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Master.

110
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Master.

111
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Master Luo, don't worry.

112
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
My master is right here.

113
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay.

114
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Master.

115
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,420
Master, the

116
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,200
Immortal is hurt.

117
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
The Immortal is hurt again.

118
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Take her inside.

119
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay.

120
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Master is going to treat Uncle Luo.

121
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Master Luo, I'll send you back.

122
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Okay.

123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Master, we're in the mountain now.

125
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'll treat you first.

126
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
We're all fine.

127
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
It's okay.

128
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Thank you.

129
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Thank you, Master Luo.

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
I'm so glad to see you.

131
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Come on.

132
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
My master is really very good.

133
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
You're welcome.

134
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Thank you.

135
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Master Luo.

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Master Luo.

137
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Thank you.

138
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Thank you.

139
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Master Luo.

140
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Thank you.

141
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Master Luo.

142
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Thank you.

143
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Qingmu, you must get better soon.

144
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Teacher.

145
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Teacher, how is he?

146
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Xiu'er always says that he has caused many disasters.

147
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Teacher.

148
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
His cultivation is too weak.

149
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
He won't be able to wake up soon.

150
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Even if he wakes up, his power is not as great as before.

151
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Qingmu.

152
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Jincheng.

153
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Wake up.

154
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Jincheng.

155
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Jincheng, don't laugh anymore.

156
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Jincheng.

157
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I don't want to lose you.

158
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Yesterday, you asked me.

159
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
I can break you now.

160
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Even if your teacher comes back,

161
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I won't leave you.

162
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Jincheng.

163
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Wake up soon, okay?

164
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Jincheng.

165
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Good morning.

166
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
What are you doing?

167
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Good morning.

168
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
Wait for me. I'll light the fire for you.

169
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Jincheng.

170
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Jincheng.

171
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Jincheng.

172
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Jincheng.

173
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Jincheng.

174
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Jincheng.

175
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Jincheng.

176
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Jincheng.

177
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Jincheng.

178
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Jincheng.

179
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Jincheng.

180
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Jincheng.

181
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Jincheng.

182
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Jincheng.

183
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Jincheng.

184
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Jincheng.

185
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Jincheng.

186
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
The problem is...

187
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Master.

188
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,800
Master.

189
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
Is there any other way?

190
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,120
Why did he make himself so embarrassed?

191
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,960
Uncle met someone with half of his cultivation.

192
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,440
He tried his best to protect him.

193
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,760
That's why he got hurt.

194
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,680
It's Luo Wangping's child?

195
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,520
Yes.

196
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,440
I see.

197
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Luo Wangping promised to trade his life for the cultivation of the Magical Green.

198
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,000
But he broke his promise.

199
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
When the Magical Green was in danger,

200
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
it was attacked by the beast.

201
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,120
It almost lost its life.

202
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
Who would have thought that

203
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
20 years later,

204
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,920
he would meet the child of the Luo family?

205
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,280
Let's not talk about it.

206
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Let's go find the medicine.

207
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,680
Is it warmer now?

208
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,760
Qin.

209
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
I've got you into trouble.

210
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,680
No.

211
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,040
You're not.

212
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
Don't fall asleep.

213
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,960
I'm a little sleepy.

214
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,880
Jinzhao.

215
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't sleep.

216
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,560
Don't sleep.

217
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,440
If you dare to fall asleep,

218
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,680
I'll take all your money away.

219
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,480
And the little jade pendant.

220
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
I'll take it home.

221
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,400
Don't take it as a reward.

222
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,920
Jinzhao.

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,520
Promise me.

224
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,200
You won't tell anyone.

225
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,640
I'll search for him in the world of the red.

226
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,920
I know him well.

227
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,640
I have the cultivation of the past generation.

228
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
No wonder I feel so familiar

229
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,760
when you read the cultivation for me.

230
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,280
Zhao Yan.

231
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,840
I haven't seen such an innocent person like you for a long time.

232
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,320
You're quite cute.

233
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Who would have thought that

234
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,040
20 years later,

235
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,320
he would meet the child of the Luo family?

236
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,600
You said

237
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
I was an innocent woman.

238
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,840
But I think you're the one.

239
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,200
You should give up your merit

240
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,000
and give your half of your cultivation to a stranger.

241
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,040
I only remember the memories of you.

242
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,960
I'm afraid that we won't meet again.

243
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,360
I'm afraid that we won't meet again.

244
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm afraid that we'll never meet again.

245
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
In a moment,

246
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,080
we'll meet again.

247
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,200
We, the Luo family,

248
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,920
promise to repay each other.

249
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,320
I'll return the cultivation of the past generation to you.

250
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,880
I wish to see you again.

251
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I wish we can be together forever.

252
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,440
I wish we can be together forever.

253
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,640
I wish we can meet again.

254
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,080
I wish we can meet again.

255
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I wish we can meet again.

256
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,640
It seems that

257
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,120
we don't need this medicine anymore.

258
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,760
You've been used to giving me gifts.

259
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm afraid that you've never thought that someone

260
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,200
would really return the cultivation to him.

261
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,200
You're indeed the master of the Luo family.

262
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,720
You're very generous.

263
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
I'm not

264
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
caring for you for nothing.

265
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,120
It's late.

266
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
Xiu'er, go back and rest early.

267
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,640
I'll go find Yue Xiaoge.

268
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,360
Master, I'll go with you.

269
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
Okay, be careful.

270
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,080
Go.

271
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
It's very strong.

272
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Let us do it.

273
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Your Majesty, please go and check.

274
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,820
I'll wait for your decision.

275
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Yes.

276
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
The future is in your hands.

277
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,920
I'll be right there.

278
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,320
I'll do my best.

279
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Yes.

280
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Yes.

281
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
Yes.

282
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Yes.

283
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Yes.

284
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Yes.

285
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Yes.

286
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
Yes.

287
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Yes.

288
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Yes.

289
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Yes.

290
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Yes.

291
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Yes.

292
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Yes.

293
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Yes.

294
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Yes.

295
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Yes.

296
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Yes.

297
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
Yes.

298
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Why did you follow them over and over again?

299
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,320
What is your intention?

300
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,120
You guys should protect them.

301
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
They are already injured.

302
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
No wonder His Majesty is worried about you.

303
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,320
Please go back and tell His Majesty

304
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,520
that Qi He and Yue Jingzhao are training.

305
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,720
Everything is under our control.

306
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
No need to panic.

307
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,520
Someone is here.

308
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,320
Xiao Huan, let's go.

309
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,320
Let's go.

310
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Let's go.

311
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Teacher, they are over there.

312
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,720
Xiao Huan, are you okay?

313
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I'm fine.

314
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,320
I want to use the bathroom.

315
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
That one.

316
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
You just take it.

317
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I don't want move.

318
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,880
Excuse me

319
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,180
I have been after some beef

320
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,120
dessez

321
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,500
Excuse me

322
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,480
Excuse me

323
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,460
Just a moment

324
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm sorry

325
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,900
You have seen the beef

326
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,520
Excuse me

327
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,660
there you go

328
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,420
We've finished let everyone eat

329
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,040
Traditionally they mambe

330
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,920
And that you get orders

331
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,860
Yet this beast dog is dead.

332
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,040
Go, go.

333
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,120
Go, go.

334
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,420
Kyle?

335
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,260
You're here!

336
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,500
Zhang Yan.

337
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,700
Xiao Xiao Yan, return the cultivation to me.

338
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,900
How will you be able to sustain it?

339
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,300
Give me the cultivation of the thousand times.

340
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,700
It can only make me more powerful.

341
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
It can't even kill me.

342
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,900
For the thousand times, they are more useful.

343
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Xiao Xiao Yan, what do you want?

344
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,300
I suddenly realized today

345
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,900
that twenty years ago, my father and Senior had a deal.

346
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,100
So, in my youth,

347
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,100
I already received the grace of Senior.

348
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,100
His father never kept his promise.

349
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,500
Then, I should return the cultivation of the thousand times to Senior.

350
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,700
For the thousand times, the person who asked for my cultivation didn't know how to return it.

351
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
I gave it to him, so I gave it to him.

352
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,100
You are the first person who returned the cultivation to me.

353
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Xiao Xiao Yan,

354
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
you returned my cultivation

355
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,900
just to repay the debt.

356
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Look at the sky, the leaves are like clouds, I am scattered.

357
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,300
The love that was before

358
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
can't be crossed.

359
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,100
It's you.

360
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,500
Looking at your figure, passing through the thousands of miles.

361
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
I am the Crown Prince.

362
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,300
The Heaven and Earth are like a mirror.

363
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,500
A bird is watching the sky.

364
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,300
In the vast sea of people, a single word has become a thread that is tied to you.

365
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,900
I can't help but come closer to you.

366
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,300
It's hard to cross the end.

367
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,500
If love is a heart that is broken, what should I do to be able to be with you?

368
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
I will try my best not to let you become a piece of my memory.

369
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,900
Xiao Xiao Yan,

370
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Look at the sky, the leaves are like clouds, I am scattered.

371
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,300
You left me to cross the end.

372
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,700
You returned my cultivation to me,

373
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,100
so I returned it to you.

374
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,700
Today, I almost lost my life because of this.

375
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,700
I, Lu Zhao Yan, am guilty.

376
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
I don't deserve you.

377
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,900
But I don't care how much cultivation I have, how long I can live.

378
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,100
I care!

379
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,500
Senior, I care!

380
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,700
The end of the long night.

381
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Look at the sky, the leaves are like clouds, I am scattered.

382
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,100
The love that is complete, the distance that can't be crossed,

383
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,900
is destiny.

384
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,500
Between life and heaven and earth,

385
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,900
if you are in the middle of the country,

386
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,700
how about living a false dream?

387
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
What if you live for a thousand years?

388
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,300
No matter how long your life is, it's precious.

389
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,700
Senior,

390
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,700
please don't just die in the end.

391
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Senior.

392
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,700
Senior.

393
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Senior.

394
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Zhao Yan,

395
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,500
do you know that losing your power

396
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,100
will make your body weaker?

397
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,500
I have been living for twenty years.

398
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
I don't know.

399
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,500
I don't want to argue with you about this.

400
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,100
Okay.

401
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Then I will say something that you like to hear.

402
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,300
The Zhenwu Alliance

403
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,300
has a strong connection with the Qiyuan Sect.

404
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,100
I happened to be in a bad mood when I was taking away the Saint-Pyramid.

405
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,900
If that's the case, I will go to the Zhenwu Alliance right away

406
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
to find the clues.

407
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Is it funny?

408
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
You are indeed a little Zhao Yan.

409
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,900
You mentioned the Qiyuan Sect and immediately came to your senses.

410
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
Since you have returned your power,

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,300
you must take care of your health.

412
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,800
But don't manage your own property!

413
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,700
Invализ me!

414
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,100
Last year, you let meros Recht.

415
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,100
You let me Şamu down?

416
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Then I will destroy your duck pond half-baked яne rник.

417
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,300
Let me陛下陛下!

418
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Young Master can have such a rein.

419
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,900
Do you still want me to office pettyalah?

420
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
Weyhuang!

421
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
I'll make it up to you.

422
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
You've suffered a lot this time.

423
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,340
I've found you some medicine to help you recover.

424
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,700
Give it to you.

425
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,060
Thank you.

426
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,940
Before you went down the mountain with Xiu'er,

427
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,460
I've made up for you.

428
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,900
The picture shows that you have a love knot.

429
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,700
A love knot?

430
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,700
It's a knot or a bond.

431
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,020
It's not certain.

432
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,340
It seems that you're serious this time.

433
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,900
You've been playing with the world for thousands of years.

434
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,780
I've never seen you so sad.

435
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,860
Maybe it's because

436
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,980
I've never seen such a special girl like you.

437
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,580
승 akin

438
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:10,780
chairman

439
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,820
resurrection

440
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

441
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

442
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

443
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

444
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

445
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

446
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

447
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

448
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,820
I'm afraid that I can't tell you the truth.

449
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,820
The ending is hard to tell.

450
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,580
I don't want to exchange a little bit of the

451
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I don't want to exchange a little bit of the

452
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,580
The light of the soul.

453
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Leave to love.

454
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,580
The unproven double.

455
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:17,820
The unproven double.

456
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Looks like a random path.

457
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Burn marks.

458
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,820
Hiding the secrets.

459
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,820
The plot of the unproven double.

460
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,820
It's all my little game.

461
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Arrangement.

462
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
It's destined to be me.

463
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,820
I'm going to tell you the truth.

464
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Even if the ending is hard to tell.

465
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,820
I don't want to exchange a little bit of the

466
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,820
The light of the soul.

467
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Leave to love.

468
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,820
The unproven double.

469
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,820
It's destined to be me.

470
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:30,820
I'm going to do my best for you.

471
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Even if the effort may be unfulfilled.

472
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,820
I don't want to exchange a little bit of the

473
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,820
The light of the soul.

474
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Leave to love.

475
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:55,820
The unproven double.
