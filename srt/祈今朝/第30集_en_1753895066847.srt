1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
How are you doing now?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,040
Thank you.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't want to leave regrets behind

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to exchange my life for another

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I decide to let go of my guard

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who will I give my heart to?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to fall asleep

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hope there will be no regrets in winter

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't regret the journey

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't regret it either

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because you are the secret of the soul

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I pray for a miracle

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will be lucky even if I am burned by time

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And I only wish to go to the stars for you

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Search for a miracle forever

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will never give up on my journey

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Episode 16

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ying Xuwei, they have entered the soul of the soul

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Where is the key

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Miss Lao Shuxuan is waiting

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
General Lin Yuan

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want to take the key of the hot sea this time

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know what you think

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How should we continue our contract relationship

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Two leaders

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
After today's farewell

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If we meet again

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You and I will do it

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The key of the hot sea

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The soul

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All the memories in the world

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The final place to flow

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To be more careful

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Memories of the destruction

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In this soul

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's like the most ordinary running water

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What did you see

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I saw a lot of things I had forgotten

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let me think about it

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Think carefully

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My life is not a roundabout

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When I came back last time

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This dragon's foot is missing

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
It seems that

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
more than us

48
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,880
have been here

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
for the past three years.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
Boss took it away.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
What's the use of taking the dragon's horn?

52
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,800
It's used to make the Precious Sea Pill.

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
It's really in your hands,

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,160
isn't it?

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Precious Sea Pill

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
was made with the Dragon Bone.

57
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
The magical power left on the Dragon Bone

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
can confuse and help us.

59
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
It makes Zhuyu think

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,400
we're giving him the real medicine.

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Why are you doing this?

62
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
It's a long story.

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,840
Let's wait until you go out

64
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,720
to ask Boss.

65
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,280
Erniang.

66
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,840
Erniang, you're back.

67
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Where have you been?

68
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,400
You didn't bring me with you.

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to ask you

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
when will Third Brother come back?

71
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
Erniang,

72
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,160
why don't you tell me

73
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,640
where Third Brother is?

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Is it that place is very far away?

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,680
Third Brother will go there for a long time.

76
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,760
What if

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,480
your Third Brother never comes back?

78
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,080
Third Brother is going to a very dangerous place.

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,560
He's still injured.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,440
Erniang, tell me

81
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,520
where Third Brother is.

82
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
I'll protect him.

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,640
Silly boy.

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
Do you think Boss and I

85
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,840
don't care about your Third Brother's safety?

86
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Don't worry.

87
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,960
He...

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
He's just going to get a treatment.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
When he comes back,

90
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
he'll definitely give you

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
a lively Third Brother.

92
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Really?

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,400
Yes.

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I was worried for nothing.

95
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,000
When he comes back,

96
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll make sure he

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:18,320
makes a hundred grass

98
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,320
?

99
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
Why can't I RICHARD

100
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,200
find your memories

101
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
in this parallel spaceship?

102
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
We came three years later.

103
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,320
Three years later?

104
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,240
I want to find the information

105
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
in your memory.

106
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,840
I also know your identity and background.

107
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,760
I can't create it,

108
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,120
but I can exchange it.

109
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
Your existence will disappear

110
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,840
as a price.

111
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,120
From now on,

112
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,560
no one will remember you in this world.

113
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,160
Even I'm not an exception.

114
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,520
Are you ready?

115
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
To be honest,

116
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm not.

117
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,640
We thought

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
She had complete luck.

119
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,100
But we have

120
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
changed.

121
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,080
No one will remember her greatly.

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,200
The current everybody

123
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,320
can remember her well.

124
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
Is that so?

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,800
Do I look young and old

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,720
I...

127
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Everyone I cherish will forget me.

128
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,160
No matter how much time they give me,

129
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
I can't accept it.

130
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
But only I

131
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
can replace Chu Yue with Jin Zhao.

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
The mark of Qi is engraved on your soul.

133
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
It's not something life can have.

134
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
I can't create it either.

135
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
Since you want it,

136
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
then go ahead.

137
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,840
I'd like to sacrifice my life

138
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
for someone who has nothing to do with me.

139
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,560
Human.

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,540
That'd be great!

141
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,920
I'm not worthy of

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,880
being responded to by others.

143
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,440
I'd change into the blade

144
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,540
if I were to be.

145
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
I will.

146
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,040
Thank you.

147
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
I should thank you.

148
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
But you can.

149
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
Yue Jinzhou.

150
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,520
I have a gift for you

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
as a new student.

152
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
What is it?

153
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been watching you secretly for a long time.

154
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,840
I've seen

155
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,120
most of the things you've been through.

156
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
I'll put some of my memories

157
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,400
in your left eye.

158
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,240
Take it as

159
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
my last

160
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,720
compensation for you.

161
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
So every time I see the image in my left eye,

162
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,880
it's all you see.

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,560
Yuan Honghui.

164
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,280
Take care.

165
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,280
I'll see you later.

166
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Yue Jinzhou.

167
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,720
Ye Luo Hua.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,760
I don't want you anymore.

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,080
Qian.

170
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,520
Goodbye.

171
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,680
Okay.

172
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Master.

173
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm determined to set aside my guard

174
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,240
Who do I really want to give my heart to?

175
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm not afraid of regret if I dare to give it to you

176
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,880
I don't want to be a fool

177
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,040
I have no regrets even if I'm in the winter

178
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,280
I have no regrets even if I'm on a different path

179
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,160
For you are the secret to my physical appearance

180
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,520
So I hope to have a miracle

181
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,280
All that went beyond will disappear now

182
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,080
You go by

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
Your name is Yue Jinzhao

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,280
I will be weighs by your kelts

185
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

186
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
Falling in the cycle of time and space

187
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Memories fly and fall

188
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Only for happiness, not wrong

189
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Follow

190
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,280
If we can change the ending

191
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Help me to accompany him

192
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Life and death are both not afraid

193
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Love never retreats

194
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Fearless wind and storm

195
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
The journey is not the same

196
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Master

197
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I have no regrets

198
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Because you are a mysterious mystery

199
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,280
So I pray for a miracle

200
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I am a fallen flower

201
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I hope I can go to you

202
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,280
To find the miracle of eternity

203
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,280
This is not the same as the road

204
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

205
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Miracle

206
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Miracle

207
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Say you are my life

208
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,280
The traces of existence for love

209
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Do you believe them or me?

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I believe in the miracle

211
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
For you

212
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Is your master very important?

213
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
When you go back to your time and space

214
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Longtan will take back all the memories of the interchanger

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
From now on, there will be no more changes in the world

216
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
This is a wrong night

217
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I should never see his memories again

218
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
My love

219
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Xiao Huan

220
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Goodbye

221
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Goodbye

222
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Jinzhao

223
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,280
In the next three years, please give me more advice

224
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
We will wait for you three years later

225
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
You must bring Xiao Yue to us

226
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Everything that happened in this world is destined

227
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I didn't expect that we would have such a fate

228
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
It's rare that Uncle Shi is so embarrassed

229
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Okay, we should go

230
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,280
We have to take them to the Wuyan Village

231
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
It's time to leave

232
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I'll send you back

233
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Yue Jinzhao

234
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Do you believe in destiny?

235
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Someone told me that

236
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Destiny is just a possibility

237
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
It can't be changed

238
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I think it makes sense

239
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
It's the last generation's nonsense

240
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
But do you still remember

241
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Hansui Wei Shu predicted

242
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Two of you will die in a few days

243
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
I remember

244
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
In the near future

245
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Your life will end

246
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I have a sword and a companion

247
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
I will let destiny take the path it should take

248
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,280
The Last Destiny

249
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Sooner or later

250
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
The people of the Hengdao Sect will come back

251
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
The Cloud Recesses are shining

252
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
The Cloud Recesses are approaching

253
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Master came to check because of the Five-Tail Wings

254
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Mingxiu is in danger

255
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
He is in danger

256
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Check it

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Mingxiu

258
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
You can go to see Master Gu

259
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Go

260
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
See him again

261
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Go

262
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Master

263
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I'll go to the mushroom to defeat the demons

264
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Then

265
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
When Xiao'er comes back

266
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Can you

267
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Put a wooden sword on Xiao'er

268
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
I don't care

269
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
It's settled

270
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
I'll go

271
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Go

272
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Go

273
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Go

274
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Go

275
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Who

276
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Who

277
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Xiu'er

278
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Xiu'er

279
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Xiu'er

280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Xiu'er

281
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Did you come from the future?

282
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Did something happen in the future?

283
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Did Xiu'er suffer a lot?

284
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Okay

285
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
My silly Xiu'er

286
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Isn't there a master?

287
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Is it okay?

288
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,280
When did Xiu'er become unable to protect her?

289
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Three years ago

290
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Three years

291
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
It turns out that Master

292
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Only can accompany Xiu'er for three years

293
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
One year

294
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Master

295
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Can you tell Xiu'er

296
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
To make a wooden sword

297
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,260
I've no choice but to be with you.

298
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,640
If you wanted to make up with me,

299
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,940
I would've let you leave.

300
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,860
So,

301
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,340
How can a mother

302
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,920
use knowledge to county dress to accompany her husband.

303
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,640
How can a mother use knowledge to county dress to accompany her husband.

304
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,080
It's in the Ámar Building.

305
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,480
How about you go there,

306
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
and let's go to visit my father-in-law.

307
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
Don't go if he keeps her company.

308
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,180
What do I know?

309
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,120
Then I مس,

310
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
I wipe out the basis.

311
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,660
Don't cry.

312
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,280
Really awaits on the wind

313
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,700
The lonely, unseeming

314
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,140
Inconvenient scene

315
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,320
But in thisテ безよう

316
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:10,000
Even hugging is veryetheless

317
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,020
Everything isnow true

318
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,100
Whatever falls or wafers into the water

319
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,040
There's nothing is also a fake

320
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,200
Everything is something else

321
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,280
to leave劲.

322
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,560
Otherwise I will regret.

323
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
Don't stop.

324
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,600
Master,

325
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,520
I was …

326
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Being helpful close to flowers

327
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,200
closed my heart.

328
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,280
To remember you,

329
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,120
Pretty words.

330
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
I get it,

331
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,200
Master.

332
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,880
Master.

333
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,720
This time,

334
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,400
we really have to say goodbye.

335
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,040
Have you said goodbye to Han Xiong?

336
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,880
I've always wanted to know

337
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,800
what happened

338
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,320
on July 14th three years ago.

339
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,920
But I didn't expect

340
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,040
it was actually me.

341
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
Will you regret seeing him?

342
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,320
Maybe.

343
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,240
But I can see him once.

344
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,600
Let him

345
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,520
put this pair of sunglasses on me.

346
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Master,

347
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,120
he still did as I wished.

348
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,080
Although Master is gentle,

349
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,120
he is more strict

350
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,320
than others.

351
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,760
This time,

352
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
I risked the danger of time

353
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,120
to find him.

354
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,480
If I put it on the table,

355
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,040
he might

356
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
cast me out.

357
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,840
You're his little brother who raised him since he was a kid.

358
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
How can he bear to leave you?

359
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,360
Let's go.

360
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,840
The one who tries is always right.

361
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,440
The one who wins is always right.

362
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,480
Miss Ming,

363
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,360
how are you?

364
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,040
Sorry.

365
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

366
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,280
It's a good thing

367
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,000
to see the one I miss again.

368
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,880
Thanks.

369
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,640
Sister,

370
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,720
are you fear su to keep

371
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,760
protecting pian'ian after we go in?

372
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,560
We'll erase all of remarkable things

373
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,920
he will be like he never existed.

374
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,320
But the traces of his existence

375
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,600
can't be erased

376
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,920
without any trace.

377
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,160
As long as his heart and mission

378
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
are in our hearts,

379
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,480
even if we don't remember him,

380
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,920
he will still be alive.

381
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,300
processo

382
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
I like you.

383
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,700
I like you.

384
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,540
I don't know.

385
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,900
Where did I hear this sound before?

386
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
Why can't I remember it?

387
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,980

I'm sorry.

478
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,340
Wait for the wind to stop and wait for the rain.

479
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,340
Wait for the seven seasons around.

480
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,340
I and you are getting closer.

481
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Look at the north star

482
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Heart throbbing

483
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,340
The story has no trace

484
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,340
A month of wrongly written memories

485
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
It's all about you

486
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,340
All the reincarnations are wrongly you

487
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,340
Everything is unforgettable, unforgettable is you

488
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,340
The past is a picture, a touch, how silly the smile and tears

489
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,340
Will all be happy

490
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,340
I'm looking for you in the mountains

491
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,340
The empty valley is lonely and I am lonely

492
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
With the city's silence

493
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,340
Your voice

494
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,340
I will never leave you

495
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,340
This year I am looking for you

496
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,340
I will be with you in this lifetime

497
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,340
The rain is slowly falling into the sea, but your name

498
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Don't doubt my heart is always the same
