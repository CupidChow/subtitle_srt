1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Only Everyone Can Try

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,660
You are mine

3
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,900
I will write down my guard

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,020
Who I give my heart to

5
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,540
I'm not afraid of regret if I dare to give it to you

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,900
Love is not willing to be pure

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,060
I have no regrets even if I'm cold in winter

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,540
I have no regrets even if I'm not in the same place

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,540
Because you are the secret of the undisclosed

10
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,540
So I pray for a miracle

11
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,060
To turn the tide

12
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,980
Even if I'm burned by time

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,980
I only wish to wake up for you

14
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,380
Search for a miracle that will last forever

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,540
I will never leave you

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,540
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

17
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:57,540
Love with Princess

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Episode 15

19
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,500
The

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Who

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,540
Chief Luo, I'm Luo Zhaoyan

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
I'm sorry to bother you

23
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,540
I have something important to tell you

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Jincheng, is this really okay?

25
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Don't worry, I won't do anything that I'm not sure of

26
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Come on, repeat what I told you

27
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
Oh, yes, yes

28
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
I'm sorry

29
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,540
I'm sorry

30
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
I'm sorry

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm sorry

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
I'm sorry

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
I'm sorry

34
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm sorry

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
I'm sorry

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,540
I'm sorry

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm sorry

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
I'm sorry

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
I'm sorry

40
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh, yes

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
I want to defeat you with dignity

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,540
I want you to beg for mercy

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
I must defeat you with dignity

44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Brothers

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,540
I'm here to ask for justice for you

46
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
Defeat with dignity

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
Who is being so arrogant?

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,540
Isn't this Master Ju from the Zhenwu Alliance?

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540
Why?

50
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,540
You're here to ask for justice for your Master Ju?

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,540
Shi Fang

52
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,540
I want to beg for mercy

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,540
No, no, no, I was wrong

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
I want to defeat you with dignity

55
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
I want you to beg for mercy

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
You can't even make it clear

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
You want to defeat us?

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,540
Come and have a look

59
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
I believe you all know

60
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
My brother

61
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,540
He is the son of the Zhenwu Alliance's technical director

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
He has a lot of good skills

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
It's a pity that some people in the Alliance

64
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
were eliminated and suppressed

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Today

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,540
I'm going to ask for justice for him

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,540
Let everyone see his real skills

68
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Shi Fang

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Yes, I want to compete with you

70
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
Good, good, good

71
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
How about this?

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
We two will beat you two

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,540
If we win

74
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,540
You will promise us one thing

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
If we lose, we will turn against you

76
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
We will promise you one thing

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,540
How about it?

78
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Let's compete

79
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
It doesn't matter if we lose

80
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
As long as Master Ju

81
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Lend us your poor bear for a few days

82
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
You take it

83
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,540
It's over there

84
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,540
You can't even beat us

85
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
How can you beat us?

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Come on

87
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
OK

88
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
OK

89
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
OK

90
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
OK

91
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
OK

92
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
OK

93
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,540
OK

94
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
OK

95
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
OK

96
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
OK

97
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
OK

98
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
OK

99
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
OK

100
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
Come on

101
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,900
I won. This time, you have to win.

102
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,740
What's going on? You all right?

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,340
You lost.

104
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Give the lost bet and the won bet.

105
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,540
Tell me,

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,700
What do you need us to do?

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,420
Thirty taels?

108
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,860
光火招募け30,000 pink pencils.

109
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,700
3,000??

110
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,660
30 taels?

111
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,500
30 taels?

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
I'm asking for food.

113
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,180
300 taels?

114
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,660
Qingquan, 300 taels?

115
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,980
Do we have that much money?

116
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,220
Of course not.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,220
Then what should we do?

118
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,340
3... 3,000 taels?

119
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,060
You want my life?

120
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,180
3,000 taels.

121
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,020
You're a scoundrel!

122
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,500
Qingzhou, forget it.

123
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,060
You're too much.

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,140
Look, it's still Hall Leader Ju's fault.

125
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,500
Yes, yes.

126
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,580
I think

127
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,100
one tael is enough.

128
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,260
What I said to you...

129
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,020
Yes, yes.

130
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,740
Well,

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
we're here today

132
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,300
to say

133
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,180
we should work together

134
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,980
to eliminate Qi Yuan tribe.

135
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,020
Qi Yuan tribe?

136
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,020
Stand up, all.

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,660
You can't beat others.

138
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,260
It means you're not good at it.

139
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,380
You should practice more.

140
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,780
Yes.

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,700
The people of Yongwu Hall

142
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460
should be ready.

143
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,100
Zaijuan, apologize to Hall Leader Ju.

144
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,900
Hall Leader Ju, I'm sorry.

145
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,220
It was our fault.

146
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,700
Please don't take it to heart.

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,460
It's okay.

148
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,060
Hall Leader Ju is kind and kind-hearted.

149
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,340
I agree.

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,620
Mr. Yue,

151
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,700
the chief invited you to discuss

152
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,420
about attacking Qi Yuan tribe.

153
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,740
Yes, sorry.

154
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,580
Great.

155
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,580
Great.

156
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,740
Great.

157
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,020
You put this in front of Zhenwu Alliance.

158
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,100
Do you really think I'm easy to take?

159
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,740
I dare not.

160
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,100
But I was a little too much

161
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,580
with Zhenwu Alliance.

162
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
If we don't do this,

163
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,420
I'm afraid the chief won't sit down

164
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,420
and discuss with us.

165
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,980
Mr. Yue,

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,740
you two are both

167
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,100
very good at both.

168
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,900
I'm really impressed.

169
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,660
We really want to talk with you

170
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,580
and cooperate with Qi Yuan tribe.

171
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,780
That's why we decided to do this.

172
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,100
Please forgive us.

173
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,020
Why don't you meet

174
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,100
your wolf demon friend?

175
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,500
Chief,

176
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,340
Mr. Xianqing is a good person.

177
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,940
No, a good demon.

178
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,420
You treated him

179
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,140
like that before.

180
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
That Xianqing

181
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,740
can gain the trust of many of you.

182
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,580
I also believe

183
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,660
he's not some evil demon.

184
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,860
Chief,

185
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,420
you promised us?

186
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,300
I'm not a stubborn person.

187
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,300
I know what's right and wrong.

188
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Zhenwu Alliance

189
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,740
promised to fight against the enemy

190
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,220
with you.

191
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,500
I have a letter here.

192
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,620
The letter

193
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,140
is a message to me.

194
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,620
Miss Ming.

195
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,500
It's master's handwriting.

196
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,780
Miss Ming,

197
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,500
what does Mr. Gu write in his heart?

198
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,260
The words are sharp and the meaning is real.

199
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
This is Mr. Gu's style.

200
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,780
It must be Xianqing.

201
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,300
He went back and told Mr. Gu

202
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,460
about our situation here.

203
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,140
This time,

204
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,220
you found out that Qi Yuan tribe's stronghold

205
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,420
is in Silver Horse Pavilion.

206
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,700
Is the news reliable?

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,420
No.

208
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,460
Okay.

209
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,380
In case of any missing information,

210
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,980
I think you should

211
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,300
leave as soon as possible.

212
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,020
We have a good idea.

213
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,660
In this operation,

214
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,140
I will send the best of the best in the Alliance

215
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,340
to go with you.

216
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,900
They have experience in dealing with Qi Yuan tribe.

217
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,220
They will go with you.

218
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,260
I believe

219
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,580
we can destroy Qi Yuan tribe's stronghold.

220
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,180
Thank you, Chief.

221
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,780
Master.

222
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,540
Are you so unhappy

223
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,940
because of the way Chief Zuo treats you?

224
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,940
You saw it.

225
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,940
Chief Zuo must be disappointed in me.

226
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,620
I saw it with Chief Luo,

227
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
but it's different from you.

228
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,300
Chief.

229
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,500
Chief.

230
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,380
Master Xue won.

231
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,060
You mean

232
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,780
Chief Zuo is happy for me

233
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,940
because I won the competition?

234
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,460
Chief Zuo does have high hopes for you.

235
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,660
He is so happy for you.

236
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,940
I thought

237
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,260
he was angry about Senior Xian Qing.

238
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,900
He will be happy if you help him.

239
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,220
That's right.

240
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,780
Shi Fang.

241
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,860
Yao.

242
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,260
Shi Fang.

243
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,580
Chief asked me to arrange a place for you.

244
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,860
It's still Ji Xiao Tang as usual.

245
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,980
Ji... Ji Xiao Tang?

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,020
Chief didn't say

247
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,580
he would abolish your position.

248
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,900
Shi Fang.

249
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,860
You won the competition

250
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,460
between Chen Qian Ju and Xu Qing Ning.

251
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,060
Many brothers in the Alliance

252
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,100
have changed their minds about you.

253
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,460
Next, you will attack Silver Horse River.

254
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,220
Show your true skills

255
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,180
and let them see it.

256
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Shi Fang

257
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,660
will still be the leader of Ji Xiao Tang.

258
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,780
I won't let you down.

259
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,500
Okay.

260
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,820
I won't bother you.

261
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,460
Okay.

262
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,420
Don't be so stupid.

263
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,460
Tomorrow,

264
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,740
there will be a tough battle.

265
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,740
Shi Fang.

266
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,460
We didn't say anything wrong, right?

267
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,500
How can I find a way to get rid of Huo Shan?

268
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,020
I won't favor him.

269
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,340
She left it for you.

270
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:53,920
I have no other económ to spend my money judgment

271
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
You can have a look.

272
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,040
Miss Yue,

273
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
I'll use this dagger

274
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
as a defense.

275
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,520
A brave man.

276
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
It must be from a husband and wife.

277
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,320
It's quite useful.

278
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,960
Princess Xu.

279
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,840
Let me ask you something.

280
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:16,880
I was in search of something from Tian Yi-Demon Valley.

281
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
But I only found this.

282
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,360
The star of Tian Yi-Demon Valley?

283
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,540
so I'll be wondering

284
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,860
if there's anything else

285
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,300
I need you to do.

286
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,840
Just so you know,

287
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,740
Never mind.

288
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,540
Just facts.

289
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,940
I'll ask Rankter Jing.

290
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,440
Why did I do this to you?

291
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,500
Jingzhe, come here.

292
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Good.

293
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Enjoy your meal.

294
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,520
Thank you.

295
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
Mr. Yue.

296
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,120
Have some cakes.

297
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,120
Oh.

298
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,520
It's the old rule.

299
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,520
Okay.

300
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,120
Okay.

301
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
Why are you alone today?

302
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Where's your wife?

303
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,320
She's back in her home.

304
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,720
You should have

305
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,520
picked her up from her home.

306
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
I'll give you

307
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,520
another piece of plum cake.

308
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,520
Here.

309
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,720
Thank you.

310
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,720
Thank you.

311
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
Thank you.

312
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,320
Remembering you in my memory

313
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,120
Reuniting is not an old habit

314
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm afraid I'll say goodbye

315
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,920
I'm afraid we'll be apart in the world

316
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,320
For a moment, I'm afraid it'll be forever

317
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,520
I'm afraid I'll turn back and look for you in the world

318
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
No matter what our relationship is,

319
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
we'll be together forever.

320
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
I'll be your guardian.

321
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
I'll protect you.

322
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
Will you leave me?

323
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,720
Are you thinking about Yue?

324
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,120
I wonder how he's doing

325
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,320
in the Sea of Heaven and Earth.

326
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,120
He's the young lord of the Fish Clan.

327
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,720
He should be doing well.

328
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,320
Yes.

329
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,520
He's the young lord.

330
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,520
He's the young lord of the Fish Clan.

331
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,120
He's the young lord of the Fish Clan.

332
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,120
He should be doing well.

333
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,920
I can understand you.

334
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,120
Just like...

335
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Just like me and Doubao.

336
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,720
If Doubao suddenly leaves me one day,

337
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,120
I'll be in pain for a long time.

338
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
Just like you and Yue.

339
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
You've been together for so long.

340
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,520
Then it's normal for you to miss him.

341
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Is it because Miss Yue can't leave you,

342
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,320
or you can't leave Miss Yue?

343
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,520
Well.

344
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,920
Did I say something wrong again?

345
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,320
No.

346
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
You're right.

347
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
I can't leave him.

348
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,320
I can't leave him forever.

349
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,520
I can't leave him.

350
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,120
I can't leave him.

351
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
You...

352
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,720
You're right.

353
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
You want us to leave before he leaves?

354
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Why don't you ask me

355
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,160
Please don't mind what happened before.

356
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,280
It's our responsibility to destroy the Qiyuan Sect

357
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,440
and return the people's safety.

358
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Don't worry, Master Wen.

359
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,720
We will work together.

360
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,000
Brothers,

361
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,040
the Five Great Alliance, the Luo family,

362
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,120
and all the young heroes

363
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,440
are officially allied today

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,960
to destroy the Qiyuan Sect together.

365
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
Destroy the Qiyuan Sect! Destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

366
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,640
Destroy the Qiyuan Sect! Destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

367
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
The five heroes

368
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
are like the world.

369
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,680
The young heroes are growing up freely.

370
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,160
I should be here

371
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,400
with everyone.

372
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,280
Yue Xiaoqiang,

373
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,480
do you have anything to say?

374
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,440
Let's go together

375
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,640
and destroy the Qiyuan Sect.

376
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,280
Let's go together

377
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,760
and destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

378
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
Let's go together

379
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,560
and destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

380
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,240
Let's go together

381
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,120
and destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

382
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,560
Let's go together

383
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,200
and destroy the Qiyuan Sect!

384
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,080
The heroes of the past

385
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,800
are the young heroes.

386
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,360
Meng Zheng.

387
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,400
Master,

388
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,160
is there something good going on?

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,680
The imperial edict

390
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,760
said that

391
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,520
I should organize the private edicts of the different places

392
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
and take the mature Qiyuan Pearl

393
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,040
to the General Hall.

394
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,920
What do you think

395
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,600
it means?

396
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,600
It's...

397
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,520
It's obvious.

398
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,960
Right now,

399
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,760
only you are the highest

400
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,120
in the private edicts of the Qiyuan Sect.

401
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
In my opinion,

402
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,280
the imperial edict

403
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,240
is to make you

404
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,920
show your face to the disciples

405
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
of the different places

406
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,960
and take the position of the chief.

407
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
You are the supreme leader.

408
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
There's no time to waste.

409
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,920
I'll go to the General Hall

410
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
right now.

411
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,680
Master.

412
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,680
You've taken the position of the chief.

413
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
What about the Waving Shadow Pavilion?

414
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
Alright.

415
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,560
You'll take the position of the chief.

416
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,720
Keep an eye on it.

417
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Yes.

418
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,640
Do you hear me?

419
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,160
Yes.

420
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,320
Go.

421
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,040
The entrance to the Waving Shadow Pavilion

422
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,240
should be around here.

423
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,240
Why don't we split up and search separately?

424
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,600
The terrain is complicated here.

425
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
It's too far to split up.

426
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,040
Why don't we split up

427
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,960
and contact each other at any time?

428
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
Okay.

429
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,960
Let's go.

430
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
Master, let's go.

431
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,880
Okay.

432
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,040
Xu.

433
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
I wonder what Master Wen is thinking.

434
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
He asked two unreliable people

435
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
to be the vanguards with us

436
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
to find out the military situation.

437
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,840
He and Miss Luo

438
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,160
took people to the mountain to pick you up.

439
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,400
Master Wen

440
00:25:45,440 --> 00:26:14,620
You're making your own

441
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,420
Sohakeный

442
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:32,380
The

443
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,060
ly

444
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,100
Water

445
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,780
is

446
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,580
so

447
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,260
Thanks for your help, Young Master Yue.

448
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,260
How did you know there were ambushes here?

449
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,980
I felt that these footprints were left too deliberately.

450
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,260
I didn't expect that I was really wrong.

451
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,260
I'll wait for you tomorrow morning.

452
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,100
It's okay.

453
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,380
Everyone be careful.

454
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,620
Yes.

455
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,780
Since there are ambushes here,

456
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,420
it means that the entrance of Qi Yun Sect

457
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,500
should be not far from here.

458
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,460
Yes.

459
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,300
Are you okay, Old Xue?

460
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,140
I'm fine.

461
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
I'll go back to the inn.

462
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,220
I'll go back to the inn.

463
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,900
Don't worry.

464
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,660
I'll go back to the inn.

465
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,300
I'll go back to the inn.

466
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,220
I'll go back to the inn.

467
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,780
Luckily, Young Master Yue is here.

468
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,140
Jin Zhao.

469
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,340
Jin Zhao.

470
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,700
I heard some noises on the stone wall.

471
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,620
Maybe it's the base of Qi Yun Sect

472
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,980
in the stone wall.

473
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,260
Let's go and have a look.

474
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,980
Okay.

475
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,220
It's really me.

476
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,060
It's me.

477
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,900
I didn't expect that the hand of this strong man

478
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,180
is so convenient.

479
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,540
It seems to be a tough battle.

480
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,220
Let's go down the mountain first

481
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,380
and get the temperature to block them.

482
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,220
Okay.

483
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,740
Wait.

484
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,780
Just a little wave,

485
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,780
I can handle it with ten square meters.

486
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,660
Someone is really bragging about it.

487
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,780
Go in.

488
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:18,860
Wait.

489
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,300
Let's see if there is a good plan.

490
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,460
Jin Zhao.

491
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,340
So this is the effect

492
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,500
of the mask you asked me to make before.

493
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,620
The chance is left to the prepared person.

494
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,260
Who is it?

495
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,460
Get out!

496
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,540
Wewood Dreasher Meng

497
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,100
always disasters people.

498
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,860
You want to die?

499
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,500
Come here.

500
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,100
Let's find out who is that bold

501
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,580
to let me meet with them in person.

502
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
Official.

503
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,540
I Xiukang's blade wasочку,

504
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,580
to be my significant physical resp Trunger.

505
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,020
Magistrate Xue.

506
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,900
I...

507
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,140
How dare you!

508
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,540
How dare you be rude to His Lordship!

509
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,660
Get lost!

510
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,180
Get lost! Get lost!

511
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,140
Minister Yue is really smart.

512
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,540
Who is he?

513
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,340
I...

514
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,420
I'm His Lordship's personal guard.

515
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,460
Nice to meet you.

516
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,420
What can I do for you, Your Lordship?

517
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,780
What...

518
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,900
What... What does this mean?

519
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,460
You're still not doing your job well.

520
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,060
You let His Lordship work day and night,

521
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,340
and you're so tired.

522
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,820
You're all personal guards.

523
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,660
Why don't you understand His Lordship's meaning?

524
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,020
Yes, yes, yes. You're right.

525
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,820
His Lordship means that

526
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,740
you've been being

527
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,020
trampled on by these

528
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,500
scoundrels lately.

529
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,460
Is your division the most stable?

530
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,060
We'll find a chance to attack them later.

531
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,060
That's right.

532
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,780
I have eight hundred pairs of eyes staring at me every day.

533
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,060
Are you trying to

534
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,020
punish me?

535
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,300
Punish me! Punish me!

536
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,900
I'm sorry.

538
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,980
His Lordship means that

539
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,740
you're working hard.

540
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,020
We'll work hard to take you to a good place.

541
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,020
Thank you, Your Lordship.

542
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:08,980
Go up.

543
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,740
Go up.

544
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,660
I didn't expect to see a fake cat.

545
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,340
Yue Qingzhou,

546
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
you've done your job.

547
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,740
Meng Cheng,

548
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,140
it's been a long time.

549
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,340
Who... Who are you?

550
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,980
It's you, kid.

551
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,540
Why do you look so much like His Lordship with the mask?

552
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,820
Where is the General Manager's position?

553
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,780
I'm loyal to His Lordship.

554
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,180
I won't tell you.

555
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,140
Fine.

556
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,780
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

557
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,460
Tell me where the General Manager's position is.

558
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,540
Okay. Okay.

559
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,220
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

560
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,140
Little brother,

561
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,420
have you heard of the protection of the body?

562
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,300
Protection of the body?

563
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,460
This technique

564
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,060
can erase the memory and character of others.

565
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,060
Excuse me,

566
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,220
have you heard of the protection of the body?

567
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,500
Protection of the body?

568
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,500
Have you heard of it?

569
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,380
We're all born with it.

570
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,260
We've never heard of it.

571
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,140
We're all born with it.

572
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,300
Never heard of it.

573
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,180
Never heard of it.

574
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,500
Your Lordship.

575
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,220
Excuse me,

576
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,300
do you know what the protection of the body is?

577
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,980
What is it?

578
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,820
The protection of the body.

579
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
What is it?

580
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,820
The protection of the body.

581
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,100
Little Junya,

582
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,060
if you want to study,

583
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,740
go to the hall.

584
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,860
I've never

585
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,700
learned to read in my life.

586
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,540
I don't want to read.

587
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,580
Read?

588
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,580
The protection of the body.

589
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,220
Meditation.

590
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,540
Meditation technique.

591
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,940
Legend says

592
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,100
I can enter any sea of life.

593
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,540
If I can enter the sea of life that can help me sleep,

594
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,180
I'll find a way to get rid of the protection of the body.

595
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,660
The protection of the body.

596
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,900
Whose water is this?

597
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,380
I feel so bitter.

598
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,380
You're the light?

599
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,420
So you're alive.

600
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,660
You've been waiting for too long.

601
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,820
I've forgotten that I'm still a living fish.

602
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,620
Why is my life so miserable?

603
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Why do I have to work so hard to be a carpenter?

604
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,780
Carpenter?

605
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,340
What is that?

606
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,620
It's a fish.

607
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
It's a fish.

608
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,660
It's a fish.

609
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
It's a fish.

610
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
It's a fish.

611
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
It's a fish.

612
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
It's a fish.

613
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,660
It's a fish.

614
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
It's a fish.

615
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,940
When you work, you shine.

616
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,660
When you work, you shine.

617
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,420
Why is there a carpenter in this world?

618
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,260
Why can't I be a fish?

619
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,900
I've been working for 300 years.

620
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,100
When will I be a carpenter?

621
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,300
My life is so miserable.

622
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,500
I Lindsay O exchange

623
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
You have succeeded in your wish.

624
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,860
The color of the music and the lyrics

625
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
Write a piece of memory

626
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,460
It's all about you

627
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,460
All the reincarnations and encounters are made up of you

628
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,460
Everything is unforgettable and unforgettable

629
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,260
The past is a scene

630
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,860
How many smiles and tears

631
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,860
All for happiness

632
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,860
The mountains and rivers are looking for you

633
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,060
The wind and the mountain are lonely and I am echoing

634
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,060
The city is quiet

635
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,060
I'm in love with your voice

636
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,060
I can't leave you

637
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,060
I'm crying and looking for you

638
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,060
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

639
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,060
The rain slowly rolls around your heart

640
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,060
Don't doubt my heart is always like this

641
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,060
When the wind rises and the rain stops

642
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Waiting for the long-lost memory

643
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,060
Waiting for me and you to get closer

644
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,060
Look at the north star

645
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Heartbeats are silent

646
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,060
The story has no trace

647
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
The color of the music and the lyrics

648
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
Write a piece of memory

649
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,060

All for happiness
