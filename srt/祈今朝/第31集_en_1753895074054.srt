1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm afraid that I'll regret it if I give it to you.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,400
Love doesn't want to be in the water,

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,600
but I have no regrets even if I'm in the winter.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,800
We have different paths,

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200
but I have no regrets either.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Because you are the secret that I never know.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,000
So I pray that you will not regret it.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
So I pray that there will be a miracle.

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,600
I will be careful even if I'm burned by time.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I only wish to wake up for you.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
I will search for a miracle that will last forever.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
I will never leave you.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Love is the most beautiful meaning of mystery.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,200
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Episode 1

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
The Long Ballad

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
This is...

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
the other room.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Why haven't I slept well after coming back from time?

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Long Ballad

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
Jingzhao, you're finally awake.

22
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait for me, don't move.

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Jingzhao, I've prepared a bowl of hot egg noodles for you.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Try it.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Only when you grow up can you become stronger,

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and protect the people you want to protect.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Jingzhao, I want to protect you too.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jingzhao, I have to加果炉了

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mei Huan, why do you have to say that?

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's nerve-wracking.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,300
You're being so

32
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
irritating.

33
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:27,200
It's because you were varied and

34
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,120
You've been really working hard

35
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,480
Drawing a couple of new ministers

36
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,800
I hope you can finish it soon

37
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I, too

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,920
I tried everything

39
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
But in fact

40
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,440
a few things

41
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,960
yet actually

42
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,280
Actually

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
You are still in theuely

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
I decided

45
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,360
An outline name

46
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,320
It's as bad as your noodles

47
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
It's been three years

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,840
You only have two greens and one egg in your noodles

49
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,440
What?

50
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
You are so angry

51
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,800
Yes, I'm telling the truth

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,560
You can't tell the truth, you can only tell the truth

53
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,680
Brother San

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Why are you here?

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,200
Brother San, you promised to make me grass and green pavilion

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
When did you make it for me?

57
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
Why is it so strange?

58
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,080
I always feel like I'm living someone else's life

59
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,040
But it's not that familiar

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,160
Brother San

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Come on, let me make it

62
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Why do you always stay with my brother?

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,480
Kids should be polite, call me sister

64
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,200
No, I already have a sister

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,240
Really?

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,840
If I were your sister

67
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
I can cook noodles for you

68
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,840
You are so annoying

69
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Brother San, are you done?

70
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,120
Almost

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,560
Done

72
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,600
Brother San, is this grass and green pavilion?

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
You used to make it well

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,240
Why is it so familiar now?

75
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,120
That's right

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
Painting, making grass and green pavilion

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
Brother San is not good at it

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Not yet

79
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,640
I mean, I know how to paint

80
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,800
But I'm not good at making things

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
But I can make it

82
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,120
You don't believe me?

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,760
I'll go get the one he used to make

84
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
You are good at painting

85
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,920
Of course

86
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
Let's go out and have a walk

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,480
Okay

88
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,640
Why doesn't Brother San wait for me like before?

89
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Come here

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,840
Did you find him?

91
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,320
Yes

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,280
Although

93
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,880
Only you, Shi Feng, Xian Qing, Zhao Yan, and Ming Xiu.

94
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,280
These friends.

95
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,480
Me too.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,280
I don't know why, but since I came back from Gui Xu,

97
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,880
I seem to have a new understanding of myself as a pig and a murderer.

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Everyone has something that they can't control.

99
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,080
It's not just me who is suffering.

100
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,280
If I pay attention to the time and space, the whole human world will be in a state of chaos.

101
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,080
I feel that I'm stopping him from doing the right thing.

102
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Gui Xu

103
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,080
Sit.

104
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Gui Xu

105
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Let's make things clear first.

106
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,080
First, in the past three years,

107
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,880
the people of the parallel world are enemies to me.

108
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,080
If you want me to do something, please make things clear first.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,880
If I think it's okay, then I can help you do it.

110
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Gui Xu

111
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,280
I know that you and the Zhenwu Alliance are quite distant.

112
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I hope that you can represent the Taoism Seeker

113
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,080
and go to the Left-Winged to propose a cooperation.

114
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,680
We will fight against Zhu Yu together.

115
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,480
Zhu Yu is in heaven. What can the Alliance do to him?

116
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I have already handed over the fake medicine to Zhu Yu.

117
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,280
Zhu Yu has been based on the power of the hot sea for a long time.

118
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,080
He will bring the fish tribe's main force to the ground.

119
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,480
The Zhenwu Alliance will then have to control the fish tribe.

120
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
We will let Zhu Yu and the Martial Soul be free.

121
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,280
Will Zhu Yu really be fooled?

122
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Zhu Yu doesn't know that the medicine is fake.

123
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,280
If he wants to open the hot sea,

124
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,280
as long as Luo Zhao Yan can secretly use the real medicine,

125
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,880
use the real medicine to help him,

126
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,080
Zhu Yu will then use the hot sea's power without any precautions.

127
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,680
He can then break the Martial Soul

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,480
and activate the magic of the brother-in-law.

129
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
After Zhu Yu loses the power of the Martial Soul,

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
he will then recover from the pain of the Peng Hua.

131
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,880
He will definitely return to the place of the Martial Soul

132
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,080
and try to control the Peng Hua.

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,680
That is when he is most weak.

134
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
It is also the best time for you to assassinate him.

135
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,680
At that time, we will then set off the fire of Zhu Yu in the jade enchantment.

136
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,880
We will try our best to hurt him and try to gain time for you.

137
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I didn't underestimate your jade enchantment.

138
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Your attack on Zhu Yu

139
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
is no different from the one on the sheep.

140
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
That is not necessarily the case.

141
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,280
If we hit the weakest point of his spiritual armor,

142
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,880
then a miracle will occur.

143
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,880
So you have planned so much.

144
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,280
If I can't convince the Zhenwu Alliance,

145
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
then it will be all empty talk.

146
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,280
Recently, there have been real-life incidents

147
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,680
happening in all parts of Shen Zhou.

148
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,280
Based on Zhu Yu's route,

149
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I infer that his next destination is Jing'an.

150
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,280
Why didn't you say it earlier?

151
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
I...

152
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
I know.

153
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,680
You only said it now

154
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,680
because you want the Zhenwu Alliance to see the power of Zhu Yu

155
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
and force them to cooperate with you.

156
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
Is it so difficult to tell the people of Jing'an

157
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,280
that they will be killed if they go out of the city?

158
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Will it kill you?

159
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,080
It's strange.

160
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,280
I always feel that the three of us

161
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,880
should have a close relationship.

162
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Is it a delusion?

163
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It's a delusion.

164
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,880
Qi.

165
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Qi.

166
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm here.

167
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I'm here.

168
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,080
Qi.

169
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,280
Qi.

170
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Jingzhao, what's up?

171
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,680
We're going to Jing'an soon.

172
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,080
I'll explain it to you later.

173
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,880
Go and call Xianqing and the others.

174
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,280
Okay.

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
In the middle of the corridor,

176
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,080
life is a thing that can be measured.

177
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
The lives of thousands of people

178
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
are naturally smaller than the lives of all living beings in the six realms.

179
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
Not to mention the lives of the people of Jing'an.

180
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
Hengdaozhong is standing in the sky and looking at the world.

181
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,880
He really is a common man.

182
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,680
Hengdaozhong is too unimportant.

183
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Not only Hengdaozhong,

184
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Zhu Yu also doesn't take people into consideration.

185
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,480
That's right.

186
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
No one has to be abandoned.

187
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Every life is worth respecting.

188
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,080
Qi is right.

189
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
No matter how small a life is, it's unique.

190
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
It has the right to survive.

191
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
After we arrive at Jing'an,

192
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,080
we must persuade the people of the city to run as far as possible.

193
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
Miss Yun,

194
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,880
why don't you and Qi

195
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,280
go and see how far Jing'an is from here?

196
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Jing Zhao deliberately blocked them out.

197
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,680
Is there anything you want to discuss with me?

198
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,080
I suspect that Ying Xunwei

199
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
has hidden the real way

200
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,280
to send the soul to the Martial Soul.

201
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,080
How did that happen?

202
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
They said that if you open the hot sea,

203
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,680
you can break the Martial Soul.

204
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,880
But that day,

205
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,080
Zhu Yu came to the ground with the fish tribe's army

206
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,480
and was far away from the Martial Soul.

207
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,880
How can we ensure that the soul is safe

208
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,080
by absorbing the power of the hot sea?

209
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,480
How can we ensure that the soul is safe?

210
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,680
It's the part that's hidden.

211
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,880
He thinks that you can't accept it,

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,080
so he just doesn't want to talk about it.

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,280
There's only one thing that I can't accept.

214
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
It hurts the people I care about.

215
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,080
Look! There's a cloud over there!

216
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,880
It's Zhu Yu!

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,080
It's too late. We have to hurry and go down.

218
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
Slowly.

219
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,280
This way.

220
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,480
Miss Lin!

221
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
What's wrong?

222
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
His leg.

223
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,880
Let me.

224
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
It's okay.

225
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,280
Bear with it.

226
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,680
It's okay.

227
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,080
It's okay.

228
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,480
It's okay.

229
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
Here.

230
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,480
Here, drink some water.

231
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
Drink some water.

232
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,080
Thank you.

233
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
You haven't had a drink for a long time.

234
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,080
Go and rest for a while.

235
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
I'm fine.

236
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,880
Yuexuan and Miss Yue are in the city of Jing'an now.

237
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
It should be more difficult than us.

238
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,480
I'm fine.

239
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm fine.

240
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
It should be more difficult than us.

241
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,280
Jingzhao, I can absorb the Qi Yuan Bead.

242
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,080
I want to save them.

243
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
I'll help you.

244
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,480
Let's do it together.

245
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm drunk.

246
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,280
I'm like a human being.

247
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I'm just scattered.

248
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,680
I'll take the light of the world.

249
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,280
You once lit up my world.

250
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,880
You made me feel so small.

251
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm a little bit restless.

252
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
I want to understand how you feel.

253
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,880
You're standing by my side.

254
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,280
Let's fight against time.

255
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,880
I'll write a legend with a sword.

256
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,680
You're standing by my side.

257
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,880
Let's fight against love and hatred.

258
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,480
This journey is so hard.

259
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,280
How can I solve this problem?

260
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
The legend of the Book of Books.

261
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
Here it comes.

262
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,080
The Book of Books.

263
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,280
The Book of Books.

264
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Did Jingzhao and Xiao Yue succeed?

265
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,680
Let's take the people back to the capital.

266
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,080
Then we'll go find Mr. Yue and Miss Yue.

267
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay.

268
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,680
Please.

269
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,480
Xiao Yue, are you okay?

270
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Jingzhao, I'll stay here to check the situation.

271
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
You go to the Martial Arts Alliance first.

272
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,480
Okay.

273
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Miss Yue, let's do it together.

274
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Huo Zhu.

275
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
What's up?

276
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,080
There are many brothers in the Alliance.

277
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,180
They're wearing the

278
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Take this back.

279
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,680
Lingyun.

280
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,480
Chief.

281
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
Chief.

282
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,080
Young Master Yue.

283
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,680
Jing'an City is in danger.

284
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,480
I'll deal with it first.

285
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,680
Please do it.

286
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,080
Let's go.

287
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
Let's go to the church.

288
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,880
Okay.

289
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,680
Why are there so many victims in the Alliance?

290
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Investigate it.

291
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,880
Yes.

292
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,780
Do you work for Luo family?

293
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,880
In the past 200 years

294
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,480
The natives of the Luo were buried

295
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
to by the early

296
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,800
make-ups of Lehuai Lake.

297
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,480
Now that Lehuai Lake is out

298
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:20,440
It will automatically return to the heavenly land for village massive

299
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,600
Here, takes the map of the Luo tribe

300
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,320
Look.

301
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,160
the movement of the Sea of Hot Springs.

302
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
The Sea of Hot Springs is the force of life.

303
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,360
It will form a green boat

304
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,640
in the place where it swam for a long time.

305
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,480
Until today,

306
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,720
we can still see traces of the Females

307
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
in the place where we are waiting for the wind.

308
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,840
The Fish Clan is a water clan.

309
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,320
It is not suitable to move in dry places.

310
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,960
Then, Zhu Yu will not choose

311
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,360
to soak in the desert to absorb the Sea of Hot Springs.

312
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
A few days ago,

313
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,240
the Sea of Hot Springs began to move from the Luo family.

314
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,080
A few days ago,

315
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,720
Zhu Yu got the medicine of the Sea of Hot Springs.

316
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Then...

317
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
If the Fish Clan wants Zhu Yu

318
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
to absorb the power of the Sea of Hot Springs,

319
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,440
the next appropriate place

320
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,760
is in the Wind Fence.

321
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,720
The premise is

322
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
that the Fish Clan already knows

323
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,720
the secret of the Sea of Hot Springs.

324
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,360
If the secret of the Sea of Hot Springs

325
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,320
has been known to Zhu Yu,

326
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,240
when the secret of the Sea of Hot Springs

327
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,320
was revealed,

328
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,360
Ge Tong and Miss Shuo Xuan were there.

329
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,120
It can be seen that they have been in contact for a long time.

330
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,960
And Ying Xu Wei not only knows

331
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,600
that the real medicine of the Sea of Hot Springs is in my hand,

332
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,520
but also has prepared a fake one.

333
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,640
Could it be that Heng Dao Zhong

334
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,120
has really been in contact with the secret of the Sea of Hot Springs

335
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
and designed Zhu Yu together?

336
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,280
That's right.

337
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
If so,

338
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,640
then many clues

339
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,600
can be linked together.

340
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
They designed a fake medicine

341
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,640
and gave it to Zhu Yu.

342
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,480
They tricked him and the Fish Clan to come to the other side.

343
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,800
Then, the King of Zhenwu

344
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,440
dragged the Fish Clan's main force

345
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,360
and promoted the Martial Soul Brother-in-law.

346
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,080
They made Zhu Yu and Li Tian weak.

347
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,600
Then, Heng Dao Zhong

348
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,760
confronted the Fish Clan of the Holy Land of the Sea of Hot Springs.

349
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
Then, Xiao Jin Zhao and Xiao Yue

350
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,920
gave Zhu Yu the last chance.

351
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Then the biggest problem now is

352
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,840
how to send this brother-in-law's method

353
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,640
to the Martial Soul House in Kun Ti.

354
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,880
Before, Xiao Jin Zhao and I

355
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,680
have already made a discovery on this point.

356
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,560
Heng Dao Zhong is likely to use our sacrifice

357
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,440
to achieve the goal.

358
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,880
So, Zhao Yan,

359
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,240
no matter what,

360
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,480
you must be careful.

361
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,160
Okay.

362
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,420
Lonely heyday

363
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,260
Because of Zhu Yu,

364
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,720
Jing'an becomes like this.

365
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,040
Lonely heyday

366
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Father.

367
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Brother.

368
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Father.

369
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
Father.

370
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Father.

371
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Brother.

372
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Father.

373
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
Aunt Ji.

374
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Uncle Ji.

375
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
Aunt.

376
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Little lady.

377
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I didn't expect that

378
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
the last words I said to her

379
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
was actually to scold her.

380
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I bought such an expensive thing.

381
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Aunt, please don't be sad.

382
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
It's not easy for you to be so strong.

383
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
We are all so good people.

384
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
It's all my fault.

385
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
If I could have come earlier,

386
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
Uncle Ji wouldn't have...

387
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
It's not your fault.

388
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,880
And you have already experienced it.

389
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Aunt, are you feeling better?

390
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Thank you.

391
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
If it weren't for you,

392
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm afraid that this child...

393
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Aunt Ji, don't talk nonsense.

394
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
He will grow up safely.

395
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
He will live a long life.

396
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Aunt Ji, why don't you come with us?

397
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
We will take care of you.

398
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Ji's Sect can't be destroyed.

399
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
God won't let us live.

400
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
The child and I

401
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
will live our lives.

402
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,880
We will bear the burden of our father.

403
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
We will be happy.

404
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
We will be happy.

405
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Zhu Yu, did you see that?

406
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
In your eyes,

407
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
such a small existence.

408
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Father!

409
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Sister Ning Xiu,

410
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
she cried so sadly.

411
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
She cried so sadly.

412
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
She cried so sadly.

413
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
She hid her strength and continued to walk.

414
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Sister Ning Xiu,

415
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
let's help them.

416
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
This time, we have suffered so much.

417
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
How are we going to help them?

418
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Some mountains

419
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
are hard to cross

420
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
because the person who is important to you

421
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,880
is your mountain.

422
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
But it's also for that person.

423
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Even if we fall into the forest,

424
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
we will definitely

425
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
cross that mountain.

426
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Sister Ning Xiu, I understand.

427
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Let's go back to Zhenwu Sect.

428
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I have a lot of things to do.

429
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Okay.

430
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
I will go with you.

431
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
Han Sui, Wei Shu and others,

432
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
out of the six of you,

433
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
two of you will die soon.

434
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Remember,

435
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
in the near future,

436
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
your life

437
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
will be over.

438
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Even if I am not there in the future,

439
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I will be fine.

440
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
I didn't expect

441
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
the people of Jing'an

442
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
were so badly injured

443
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
and so fatally injured.

444
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
In her eyes,

445
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
those who died

446
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,880
are no longer loyal to the Lou Yi.

447
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Chief, no matter what she is,

448
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
no matter how she sees us,

449
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
she hurts my compatriots,

450
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
we can't just sit and wait.

451
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Shi Fang,

452
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
according to what you said,

453
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Heng Daozhong manipulated the Qiyuan Sect

454
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
to contain Kun.

455
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
No matter Heng Daozhong is a righteous person or a evil person,

456
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
it's hard for them

457
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
to win against Kun.

458
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Chief.

459
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
Chief.

460
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Chen Qianjun,

461
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
the disciples in the Alliance

462
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
said that you spread the Qiyuan Pearl.

463
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
Yes.

464
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Why did you hurt your own brother like this?

465
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Are you also a member of the Qiyuan Sect?

466
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Chen Qian, I...

467
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
I lost the competition to Yue Jinzhou and Shi Fang.

468
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
I was not willing to give up.

469
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I always wanted to get my face back.

470
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Later, when I attacked Langyu Pavilion,

471
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I stole some pearls.

472
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
When I wore the pearls,

473
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I really felt that my practice was going fast.

474
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
So,

475
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
I came to give the pearls to my brothers.

476
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Li Yuchen!

477
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
Jinzhou,

478
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
are you waiting for me?

479
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I think you should be back soon.

480
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
I'll go back to the Alliance first.

481
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
What's wrong, Qi?

482
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
Jinzhou,

483
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Uncle Ji is dead.

484
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
Bai Xian,

485
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
the people are innocent.

486
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
We must find a way to do something.

487
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
I'm sure of it.

488
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
When I attacked the Qiyuan Sect,

489
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
I found that this pearl was a life-saving thing.

490
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I wanted to take it off,

491
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
but I found that it grew into flesh.

492
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I went to the doctor privately.

493
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
But the doctor said that

494
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
the pearl had been connected to the heart.

495
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
I couldn't touch it.

496
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
You two

497
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
also stole the Qiyuan Pearl.

498
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
You bunch of bastards!

499
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Good.

500
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Good!

501
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Chief,

502
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
they escaped from this trap

503
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
because they were not in Jing'an.

504
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Except for them,

505
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,880
there are some people who wear the pearls

506
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
and are on a mission.

507
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
The Lord of the Fiend is guilty.

508
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
But the most important thing is

509
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,880
to find a way to save them.

510
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
I'll try.

511
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Miss Yue.

512
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
Chief,

513
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
when I attacked the Qiyuan Sect's headquarters,

514
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I also saved the disciples of the Qiyuan Sect.

515
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
I also saved a lot of people just now.

516
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
I can give it a try.

517
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Chief.

518
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Chief.

519
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Chief.

520
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Chief.

521
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Chief.

522
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Chief.

523
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Chief.

524
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Chief.

525
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Chief.

526
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Chief.

527
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Chief.

528
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Chief.

529
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Chief.

530
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Chief.

531
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Chief.

532
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Chief.

533
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Chief.

534
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Chief.

535
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Chief.

536
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Chief.

537
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Chief.

538
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Chief.

539
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Chief.

540
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Chief.

541
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Chief.

542
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Chief.

543
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Chief.

544
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
Chief.

545
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Chief.

546
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
Chief.

547
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Chief.

548
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Miss Yue.

549
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
If the Qiyuan Pearl

550
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
is to blend in after a long time,

551
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
if it is Galloping Extremely,

552
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
it can only hurt life.

553
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
I am%.

554
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Thank you.

555
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,960
Thank you.

556
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I've already offended you.

557
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Please forgive me.

558
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
It's okay.

559
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,880
Chief.

560
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I'm here to discuss with you on behalf of the Taoism Sect.

561
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
