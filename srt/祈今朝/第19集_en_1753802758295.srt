The Long Ballad

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,280
Episode 17

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,960
limitations the strings winning memories

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
Don't leave regrets behind

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,680
Spend the rest of your life

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,480
for another chance

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,280
If you decide to take precautions

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,080
Who will you give your heart to?

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,720
If you dare to give it to me, I'm not afraid of being ruined

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,680
Love is not willing to be a burden

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,840
It's not a shame to be cold in winter

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,920
We have different paths, but I have no regrets

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,280
Because you are the secret of the universe

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,120
So I pray for a miracle

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,800
To wake up from the darkness, even if I'm burned out by time

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,680
And I only wish to wake up for you

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
To find a miracle that will last forever

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,160
I will never give up

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,160
Love is the most beautiful meaning of life

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Episode 16

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Why are you hesitating?

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Hurry up

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Qing Jun, don't worry

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
There are traces of heartbeats on both sides of the road

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm afraid there's a trap

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
We'd better discuss it first

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Mr. Yue, look

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Go left

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Listen to Mr. Yue, go left

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
Go left

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Mr. Yue, is Mr. Yue reliable?

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Of course

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Don't forget that he's not just a soldier

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Move

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Chief, chief, bad news

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,040
The bandits of the fifth gate are attacking the front gate

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
All brothers are seriously injured

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Chief, bad news

40
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
Chief

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Chief, someone is attacking the back road

42
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
What are you doing?

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Bastards, you're messing up at this time

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Stop them

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Jinzhe, how are you?

46
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm fine

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
Brother Xu

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Brother Xu

49
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Brother Xu

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Le Xu

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Le Xu

52
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Le Xu

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Sorry

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Can you make them come back to life?

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
Go left

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Go what left?

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,040
It's not the time to be impulsive

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
No, no

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Brother Chen, the Qiyuan Sect's general is here

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
It's urgent

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
You're lucky

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Yue Jinzhao, calm down

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Let's think about what to do next

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
We've been found

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
We should split up

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
One team will catch Gao Xiao

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
The other team will hold off these guards

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Yue Jinzhao

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I can hear what you mean

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
You want us to make a cannon for you

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I'll go with you

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
I'll go with you

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Yes, we'll go with you

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I'll go with you too

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
You and Miss Yue

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Go catch Gao Xiao

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Yue Jinzhao, remember

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
The blood of brothers

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Every drop of blood

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
It's all yours

81
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Go

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Be careful

83
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Go

84
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Jinzhao

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Before we left

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Uncle Gu said it was dangerous

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
But we're still here

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Since we're here

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
We must save more people

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Right?

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Go

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
You two crazy people

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Come to me to do bad things

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
You're so bold

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
You've done so much

97
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,040
I'll end you today

98
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
In my Qiyuan Sect's territory

99
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
How dare you talk like this

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Now I'll show you

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
What is no return

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Go

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Go

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Go

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Go

106
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Jinzhao

107
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Jinzhao

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,820
It seems like those Shaodong 지난 slapstick are crazy

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,840
That is Qingzhu's doing

110
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,500
What am I going to do

111
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,660
LAUGHTER

112
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,660
Master!

113
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Jinzhao!

114
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Let me try.

115
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
I can save them.

116
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
Help me block it.

117
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
Help me, Master!

118
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,140
My wife is waiting for me at home.

119
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Thank you, Master!

120
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Thank you, Master!

121
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Thank you, Master!

122
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Qi, no!

123
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
If you keep going on like this, you'll die.

124
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,660
I won't die.

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,660
I can't let Qi Yuanfeng hurt others like this.

126
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Thank you, Master!

127
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Qi Yuanzhu

128
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Why did you crush so many Qi Yuanzhu?

129
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
You're still here.

130
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Why did you do that?

131
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Qi used Qi Yuanzhu twice before.

132
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,660
But he didn't use magic.

133
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
Instead, his power increased.

134
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,660
This time, he used Qi Yuanzhu

135
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,660
to awaken the power of the gods.

136
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
How can I let him go?

137
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Third Brother!

138
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
Third Brother!

139
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,660
Qi!

140
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Qi!

141
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,660
Jinzhao, it hurts!

142
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Protect the people!

143
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Protect the people!

144
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Protect the people!

145
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Protect the people!

146
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Protect the people!

147
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,660
Protect the people!

148
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Protect the people!

149
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,660
Qi Yuanzhu used the dark emotions

150
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
before he killed the humans.

151
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Aren't you afraid that Qi can't take it

152
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
and will destroy the gods with Qi Yuanzhu?

153
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
I never do anything that I'm not sure of.

154
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
What are you going to do?

155
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Save him.

156
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,660
Third Brother!

157
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
You see the sky is falling like a cloud.

158
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
I'm scattered.

159
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
The love in front of me

160
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,660
can't cross the distance.

161
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Fourth Brother.

162
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,660
I follow you through thousands of miles.

163
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Don't be late.

164
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
I can't be so grateful.

165
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
I don't need you.

166
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,660
We are still in the same sea.

167
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
We are still in the same sea.

168
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,660
How lucky I am to be close to you.

169
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,660
How lucky I am to be close to you.

170
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
If love is the most beautiful thing,

171
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,660
what should I do to stop it?

172
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
I can't be with you in this world.

173
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,660
The light of the moon and the flag of the zither

174
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,660
are beyond my reach.

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm scattered.

176
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,660
The love in front of me

177
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
can't cross the distance.

178
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Isn't this our Qu family?

179
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
It's destiny.

180
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,660
If love is the most beautiful thing,

181
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,660
what should I do to stop it?

182
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
I can't be with you in this world.

183
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I can't be with you in this world.

184
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
Qi.

185
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Wake up.

186
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Our friends are still fighting against the enemy.

187
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
We have to keep fighting.

188
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
Wake up.

189
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
The moon and the flag of the zither

190
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
are beyond my reach.

191
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
I'm scattered.

192
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
The love in front of me

193
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
can't cross the distance.

194
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Isn't this our Qu family?

195
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
It's destiny.

196
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
The love in front of me

197
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
can't cross the distance.

198
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm scattered.

199
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
The love in front of me

200
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
can't cross the distance.

201
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
I'm scattered.

202
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
The love in front of me

203
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

204
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

205
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

206
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

207
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

208
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

209
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

210
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

211
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

212
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

213
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

214
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

215
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

216
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
I'm not afraid of anything.

217
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
I'm not afraid of anything.

218
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,780
Qin!

219
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,540
What's going on?

220
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
It's не Xiao Yue!

221
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
This sound came from Miss Yue.

222
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,480
Director Jin.

223
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,220
We done it.

224
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Miss Yue.

225
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,840
Goуди.

226
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,960
debit.

227
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,800
Yes, Moore is the誕灯.

228
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,780
Yes, Moore.

229
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,240
Even Moore is her first Lord Yun.

230
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,120
No, he's not!

231
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,200
Chief! Chief!

232
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,080
Chief, Miss Yue is actually the young lord of the Winged Clan.

233
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
She's the descendant of the ancient beast Kun.

234
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,160
She's not the leader of the Qiyuan Clan.

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,880
Besides, she's never done anything harmful.

236
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Yes, Chief.

237
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,680
I've also been to the Winged Clan.

238
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,480
Everyone, as the leader of the Five-Torment Alliance,

239
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,480
I have to make some decisions.

240
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,280
Take her down!

241
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,520
Brother Guan Ren,

242
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,320
I understand your method.

243
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,560
But I have to be punished by you.

244
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,720
If she's the leader,

245
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,720
why would she help you destroy the Qiyuan Clan?

246
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
Bian Luohuan?

247
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Who are you?

248
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,520
Chief, calm down.

249
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
San.

250
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,600
Chief,

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
why are you doing this?

252
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Chief Gao,

253
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,120
I've been doing my best to protect the Qiyuan Clan.

254
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,320
Today, I'm giving you a blessing.

255
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,120
No, no, no!

256
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,920
Please spare my life!

257
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,120
Please spare my life!

258
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
I don't want to die!

259
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,320
I don't want to die!

260
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Please spare my life!

261
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Please spare my life!

262
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Please spare my life!

263
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,520
Please spare my life, Chief!

264
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,320
I can't fly!

265
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,120
I can't die, Chief!

266
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Please save me!

267
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Save me!

268
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Save me!

269
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Why are you hiding?

270
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
Why are you hiding?

271
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
You fools!

272
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
You fools!

273
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
You!

274
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
You think that

275
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,320
they are all good people

276
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
because of their high status?

277
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,720
You believe that the Qiyuan Pearls that you've been collecting for years

278
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
are actually

279
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,120
the lives of you!

280
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,320
You're not even aware that you've been cheated.

281
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
You're still hiding!

282
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
Everyone will die!

283
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Everyone will die!

284
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,320
You! You!

285
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
You want everyone's life!

286
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
In the end,

287
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
you'll all die

288
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,120
because of the Qiyuan Clan!

289
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Chief!

290
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,720
Chief!

291
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,520
I won't admit defeat!

292
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
I...

293
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
I...

294
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I...

295
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I...

296
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
I...

297
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
How could this happen?

298
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
How could this happen?

299
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
How could this happen?

300
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
How could this happen?

301
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Everyone,

302
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
you all have seen it clearly.

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520
The so-called flying life

304
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,120
is actually

305
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,320
death.

306
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
You were driven by your own desires

307
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,720
and blindly pursued flying life.

308
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
You didn't even know the truth about the Chief.

309
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
You were crazy about a

310
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,520
empty and unimportant thing.

311
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,320
You killed each other between your peers.

312
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,520
It's really funny.

313
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,320
Remember my name.

314
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Ying Xuwei.

315
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,520
The Qiyuan Clan

316
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,320
is a gift from me, Heng Daozhuo,

317
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,720
to you all.

318
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,920
I believe that in the near future,

319
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,720
we will meet again.

320
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,320
Third Brother, let's go.

321
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Lian Longhuai!

322
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,120
Who are you?

323
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,520
Yue Jinzhao,

324
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
you will know

325
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,920
when the time comes.

326
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,320
It won't be long.

327
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
It's fake!

328
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,520
It's all fake!

329
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
What Chief?

330
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
What flying life?

331
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
It's all fake!

332
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,120
The self-destructing mechanism has started.

333
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,720
It will collapse soon.

334
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,520
Let's all die together!

335
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,320
Let's all die together!

336
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,920
It's about to collapse.

337
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Everyone, go to the exit.

338
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,520
There's no time.

339
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
You all retreat first.

340
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I'll go set up the control mechanism.

341
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
Master.

342
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Hurry.

343
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Hurry, close the door.

344
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,640
Hurry, go, go, go.

345
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,600
Hurry, go.

346
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,520
Go.

347
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,920
Hurry.

348
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,140
I wanted to use the Meetingesti to close wrongdoers's P갔 but they were all dead.

349
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,980
We can't exclusively play an important role in this.

350
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,240
Enough.

351
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
The more details Water Immortal has, the more dangerous it will become.

352
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
Defense Fire Tribe is also there.

353
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,740
They were at high altitude,

354
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,340
so they discovered a page of mysterious digital calendar.

355
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,900
Yes, yes.

356
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,020
The mountain is breaking the ground.

357
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,300
Don't move.

358
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,580
Jun Shi Fang,

359
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,060
can you let Dou Bao go?

360
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,780
Jun Shi Fang,

361
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
hurry up.

362
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,940
We'll all die here.

363
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,660
No.

364
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,900
Don't let Dou Bao go.

365
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,140
I will definitely protect Dou Bao.

366
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,060
But I want

367
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,860
to keep the only thing I have.

368
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,660
I'm in the Wugou.

369
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,780
I'll definitely kill all of you.

370
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,740
I'll kill all of you.

371
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,940
I'll kill all of you.

372
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,020
I'll kill all of you.

373
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,060
I'll kill all of you.

374
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,540
If you don't stop me, I'll kill you.

375
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,820
Don't move.

376
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,260
Master.

377
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,140
Senior Gu.

378
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,020
You can't go.

379
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,460
Don't come over.

380
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,140
Bran Fa опы

381
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,620
The thing before you

382
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,780
turned out to be here today.

383
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
Miss Lin, let me go.

384
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,980
Don't go. Miss Lin.

385
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,100
I said let me go.

386
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,620
Miss Lin.

387
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,980
Wait here.

388
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,500
Jingjing.

389
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,780
Don't cry.

390
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,920
position

391
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,060
Master, you finally wake up.

392
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,900
I'm fine.

393
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,580
How do you feel now?

394
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,420
I feel a little hungry.

395
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,700
Xiu'er, can you help me

396
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,220
find something to eat?

397
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:37,360
The

398
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,620
You usually don't leave Е青 Mountain in person.

399
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,740
After downstairs four times.

400
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,580
Is that because of

401
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,860
seeing something in the Japanese Currently mountain?

402
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,540
The light in Xiaoxiu'er's birthday

403
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,780
is good.

404
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,780
Do you remember?

405
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
I will go to Wugou.

406
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,580
I decided to go to Wugou

407
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,740
and see the future from Wugou.

408
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,060
Wugou shows that

409
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,020
this time, attacking Qiyuan Sect's Zongzong Pagoda,

410
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
Zheng Wugeng was badly injured.

411
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,100
I will go to Wugou.

412
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,540
I will go to Wugou.

413
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,180
I will go to Wugou.

414
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,860
I will go to Wugou.

415
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,620
I will go to Wugou.

416
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,420
I will go to Wugou.

417
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,100
I will go to Wugou.

418
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,700
Why do I watch the people die for the righteous cause?

419
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,060
So you'd rather sacrifice yourself for the people.

420
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,060
You see,

421
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,740
changing the fate of many people is also a good thing.

422
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,900
The only people who can change the fate of many people is them.

423
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,980
Qianqian,

424
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,700
I have a request.

425
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,860
Can you put your Elixir of Devour on my half-life?

426
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,380
Do you still have to

427
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,820
Time to heartsCry

428
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,780
Will it be the brothers who has caused death?

429
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,800
If were be they

430
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,820
They will lose their honor

431
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,360
How can we just watch them like this

432
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,180
I heard that we have a bad surgery

433
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,320
But I wonder how's it going

434
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,340
We can receive more soup

435
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,720
and we'll be fine

436
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,640
What a pity that the

437
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,320
Such perfectly!

438
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Senior, are you feeling better?

439
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,920
I'm fine.

440
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,160
You're home.

441
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
Have a walk here with me.

442
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,160
Senior, I...

443
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,040
Did I允許 you to refuse?

444
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,480
Xiao Xiu.

445
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
This is between them.

446
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,880
Brother Han Jiang knows about it.

447
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,200
Qi Yao has woke up.

448
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,040
Please take good care of her.

449
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,860
Don't worry.

450
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,700
Zhao Yan will take care of her.

451
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,380
I will be watching her too.

452
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,460
ейчас

453
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,460
그녀는 switch off

454
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,000
It's

455
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,360
Cunha

456
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,340
Why are we here?

457
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,620
You can have it

458
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,740
We will send you

459
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,540
our trusted subordinates

460
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,660
every month

461
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,740
Where's that

462
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,160
when you're not here

463
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
We are orphans.

464
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
But I can work.

465
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Although life is poor,

466
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
we can live a life together.

467
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Although our Xu is a rough man,

468
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
he often does some dirty things.

469
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
But he will never depend on

470
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
other people's poor lives.

471
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Neither will we.

472
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Madam, you misunderstood.

473
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
We didn't mean that.

474
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
I was too impulsive.

475
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
The money is

476
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
what we lend to you.

477
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
When he grows up,

479
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
you can pay him back.

480
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Don't be so stubborn.

481
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Madam.

482
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Thank you.

483
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Zheng Yuan,

484
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
your father is a good man.

485
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
You must protect your mother.

486
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
I will.

487
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
I will.

488
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Madam.

489
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
We'll leave now.

490
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Mother.

491
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I want to be a hero.

492
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I want to give you

493
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
so many good things.

494
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Zheng Yuan, good boy.

495
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
We can study,

496
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
or do business.

497
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
We don't do martial arts.

498
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
We don't interfere in the world.

499
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
If your father is still alive,

500
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I hope you can be safe.

501
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
We can marry a good daughter-in-law.

502
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
We can live a happy life.

503
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
It's not good to be a hero.

504
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
But my father is a hero.

505
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
You can't see your mother

506
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
as a hero.

507
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
If so, will you still be a hero?

508
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Mother.

509
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
I'll never see my father again.

510
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Mother.

511
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I miss my father.

512
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I want my father.

513
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
I miss my father.

514
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Mother.

515
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Don't be so stubborn.

516
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
You can't forget

517
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
your feelings and feelings.

518
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Mother.

519
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
I want my father.

520
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
I miss my father.

521
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Zheng Yuan, good boy.

522
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
You're a hero.

523
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
Don't be so stubborn.

524
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Mother.

525
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I'm a hero.

526
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
I want to grow up and protect you.

527
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
Mother.

528
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Xu Qi Ming, you bastard.

529
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
It's the wedding.

530
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
You said he was married.

531
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
But you died like this.

532
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
I didn't expect it.

533
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
I didn't expect it.

534
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Let's go.

535
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Let's go.

536
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Senior.

537
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Why do you show us this?

538
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
Tell me.

539
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Why are you so depressed this morning?

540
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I...

541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm afraid.

542
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
I'm afraid that people will say I killed someone.

543
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm afraid to be scolded.

544
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
I'm afraid

545
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
to be hated by others.

546
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm afraid too.

547
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
What about now?

548
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
What about now?

549
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I'm still afraid.

550
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
They are all living people.

551
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
They have friends and family.

552
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Because of me,

553
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Zheng Yuan died.

554
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
It's my fault.

555
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
My fault.

556
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I blindly believed in myself.

557
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
But I killed

558
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
other people's family.

559
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I almost killed so many people.

560
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
But I didn't dare to face all of this.

561
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Because of my selfishness,

562
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I almost killed Gu Qing Pei.

563
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I'm afraid

564
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
of being weak like this.

565
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Being weak like this,

566
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
I can never be a hero.

567
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Stand up.

568
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Stand up.

569
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't care about me.

570
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
What right do you have to cry?

571
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I ask you what right do you have to cry?

572
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
What's wrong with crying?

573
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Who says a man can't cry?

574
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
You hit me.

575
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Yu Zhen Zhou, you hit me.

576
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Is crying enough?

577
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Will you be sad if you cry alone?

578
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
I'm sorry.

582
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm sorry.

583
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
I'm sorry.

584
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
I'm sorry.

586
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
I'm sorry.

587
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm sorry.

588
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
I'm sorry.

589
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I'm sorry.

590
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I'm sorry.

591
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I'm sorry.

592
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I'm sorry.

593
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
I'm sorry.

594
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Don't say you're useless.

595
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
You've done a good job.

596
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
I'm sorry.

597
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Jin Cheng.

598
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
I want to do better.

599
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I won't forget

600
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
everything that happened.

601
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Me too.

602
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Did you two fight enough?

603
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
I'm sorry.

604
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
It seems that you've already understood

605
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
that the mistakes in the past can't be recovered.

606
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
The consequences of the present can be compensated.

607
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
We can only make up for the past

608
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
so that we can make up for the future.

609
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Senior Gu.

610
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You said that

611
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
the guardian of Wu Gou

612
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
can see some fragments of the future.

613
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Then,

614
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
do you believe in the jade stone you saw?

615
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
I believe.

616
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
I just said

617
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
that the future can't be changed.

618
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Even if the future is very bad,

619
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
you still have Miss Yue by your side.

620
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm not going to pay you.

622
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Don't forget what I said today.

623
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
You don't have to feel guilty.

624
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Everyone has different things

625
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
in their heart.

626
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
I made my own choice.

627
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
I will bear the consequences.

628
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Alright.

629
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
You can go back now.

630
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Thank you, Senior Gu.

631
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Qi Yan.

632
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Qi Yan.

633
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
Why is he still sleeping?

634
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
He's not sleeping.

635
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Don't cover your head.

636
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Qi Yan.

637
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Qi Yan.

638
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Jin Zhao.

639
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
Did I scare you?

640
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I saw that you were feeling down these days.

641
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
I just want to tease you.

642
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
What's wrong?

643
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Nothing.

644
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
I just want to hug you.

645
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Qi Yan.

646
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
What?

647
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I hope you can always be by my side.

648
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Always be with me.

649
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Jin Zhao.

650
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
I will always be with you.

651
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Qi Yan.

652
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
I'm sorry.

653
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm sorry.

655
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I'm sorry.

656
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I'm sorry.

661
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
I'm sorry.

662
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:47,120
My heart

666
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,860
Fl fueron

667
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Forgot my name

668
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,160
The deep feeling behind the mask

669
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Only through my eyes

670
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Who can see

671
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:19,160
It's destined that I'll fight for you

672
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Even if the ending is hard to escape

673
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,160
I don't want to exchange a little bit of my life

674
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Leave to love the unspoken double

675
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,160
I don't want to be alone

676
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,160
It looks like a random path

677
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Burn marks

678
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Hiding secrets

679
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,160
The plot of the word

680
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,160
It's all my little heart

681
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Arrangement

682
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,160
It's destined that I'll fight for you

683
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Even if the ending is hard to escape

684
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:54,160
I don't want to exchange a little bit of my life

685
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Leave to love the unspoken double

686
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,160
It's destined that I'll fight for you

687
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Even if the ending is hard to escape

688
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:26,160
I don't want to exchange a little bit of my life

689
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Leave to love the evidence of existence
