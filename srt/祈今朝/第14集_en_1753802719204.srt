1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Normally you work in the surveillance camera of someone who is in examine

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,220
What happened ?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,540
I am conditions

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,380
you chose to have this kind of situation

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,100
You have to work hard

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,960
Can you take as what?

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,540
Yes

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,240
me

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,460
Of course

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,260
I said I promise to take good care of me

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,700
It's okay

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,420
well

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,940
I will tear up my heart

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,020
and leave no regrets behind

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,180
I will give up my whole life

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,740
for another chance

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,780
If I decide to give up my guard

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,380
who will I give my heart to?

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,980
I am not afraid of being destroyed if I am willing to give it to you

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,060
I am not willing to fall asleep

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,700
I have no regrets even if I fall to the ground in winter

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,780
I have no regrets even if I have to return to the same path

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,260
Because you are the secret of the undisclosed

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,060
So I pray for a miracle

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,940
to be realized

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,780
Even if I am burned by time

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,700
I am willing to give up my heart for you

28
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,980
to find a miracle that will last forever

29
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,620
I will not give up my whole life

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,620
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,220
Episode 16

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,820
Someone is following us.

33
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,620
Jinzhao, what do you think

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,060
the person behind Grandma Shi

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,660
has something to do with Uncle Lin?

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,540
We will know when we catch him.

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,540
Everyone relax.

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Shi Fang and Miss Ming will come to us.

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,860
The front is the place. Let's go.

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,220
Miss Ming, Jinzhao and the others have already gone in.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,460
Why hasn't Qi Yuan Cong's men come yet?

42
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,100
They are not coming in.

43
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,620
They are coming.

44
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,660
The silver leaf on her body

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,420
is the same as Miss Shouxuan's.

46
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,820
She is Lin Yuan.

47
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,420
She is Lin Yuan.

48
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,940
This is the place marked on the map.

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,100
They actually lured us here.

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,700
Why didn't they kill us?

51
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,940
They are really the Long family.

52
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,420
They are really the Long family.

53
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,100
Could it be that something has changed?

54
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:42,940
ры

55
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,260
Interesting.

56
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,500
It's behind our gong gettingomicliste�가 kanj하.

57
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,900
Bring in your Uncle Lin Yuan.

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Mr. Lin, why are you here?

59
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,900
What a coincidence!

61
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,300
I saw you guys entering the hole.

62
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,900
I was worried about your safety.

63
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
So I followed you in.

64
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,900
It's good to be safe.

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Little Yue, Little Qi,

66
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,900
you...

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
What do you mean by this?

68
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,900
Mr. Lin,

69
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
I'm here to see you.

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm here to see you.

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm here to see you.

72
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
I'm here to see you.

73
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
What do you mean?

74
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
Mr. Lin,

75
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
we know you're a demon.

76
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Mr. Lin,

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
have you known our past

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
and been lying to us?

79
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
There's a misunderstanding.

80
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
Let's talk outside.

81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Mr. Lin,

82
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
tell us the truth.

83
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
No need to hide.

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,900
Take it down.

85
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Go.

86
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Mr. Lin,

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Mr. Lin is still inside.

88
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Miss Lin,

89
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
think of something.

90
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Qi.

91
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Qi.

92
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Jingzhu,

93
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
are you okay?

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
I'm fine.

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
Take it easy.

96
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Jingzhu.

97
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Jingzhu.

98
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Jingzhu.

99
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
Jingzhu.

100
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Jingzhu, are you okay?

101
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Are you hurt?

102
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm fine.

103
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
What about you?

104
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Are you hurt?

105
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
I can feel you're hurt.

106
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I'm really fine.

107
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't worry.

108
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I have to move away from these rocks.

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
You go out.

110
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Wait.

111
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I'll go out with you.

112
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Don't worry.

113
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I'll go out with you.

114
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Don't worry.

115
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
I'll go out with you.

116
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Don't worry.

117
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Wait.

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,900
There was a typhoon here.

119
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
If we use force to remove it,

120
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm afraid it will be a second typhoon.

121
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
It's bad if it threatens Yuexuan and Miss Yue.

122
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
You always ask others first.

123
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
That's what makes me worried.

124
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Stare at me.

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Do you stop crying?

126
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Yes.

127
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Jingzhu.

128
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Jingzhu, don't cry.

129
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
Jingzhu.

130
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Yuqi.

132
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Jinzhao.

133
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
I thought you were dead.

134
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Jinzhao.

135
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Why are you bleeding?

136
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
I was crushed by the stone just now.

137
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
I'll be fine when I'm back.

138
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
Jinzhao.

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Hold on.

140
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
I'll take you out.

141
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Silly.

142
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm not dead.

143
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Why are you crying?

144
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm not.

145
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
I'll help you up.

146
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Jin.

147
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Do you remember?

148
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
What?

149
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
When we woke up in Wuyuan Village,

150
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
I went to pick up the mine for the road fee.

151
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
And I came to the same wilderness.

152
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
The same desert.

153
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
I was trapped for seven days and seven nights.

154
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Jinzhao.

155
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Jinzhao.

156
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Jinzhao.

157
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm here to help you.

158
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
To find the miracle of eternity.

159
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,900
I'll never leave you.

160
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,900
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life.

161
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Who told you to come here?

162
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
You came here alone.

163
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
What if you're in danger?

164
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
What should we do?

165
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Jinzhao.

166
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Say sorry.

167
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Sorry.

168
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Why are you here?

169
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Don't talk to me.

170
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
The miracle of eternity.

171
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I'll never leave you.

172
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I'll never leave you.

173
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Don't worry.

174
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm here.

175
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
You'll be fine.

176
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
I know.

177
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
When we woke up,

178
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
you saved me once.

179
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
But now I'm thinking,

180
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
fortunately,

181
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
you didn't leave me.

182
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
And fortunately,

183
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
we're always by each other's side.

184
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Qian.

185
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
For you,

186
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
who am I?

187
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Qian.

188
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Jinzhao.

189
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Let's go.

190
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Go.

191
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Zhao Yan.

192
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Xingqin.

193
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
I'm here.

194
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm here, too.

195
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Qi.

196
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Jinzhao.

197
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Zhao Yan.

198
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
How are you?

199
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Where's Qianqin?

200
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Zhao Yan.

201
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Jinzhao seems to be hurt.

202
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Are you okay?

203
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Is there any way to move the stone?

204
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
It's the magic wand.

205
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Jinzhao.

206
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Zhao Yan.

207
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Minxiu.

208
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
The magic wand.

209
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
The magic wand.

210
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Let's go.

211
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Go.

212
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
Go.

213
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
It's so close.

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Thanks to Doubao.

215
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
This is my master's medicine.

216
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
It works faster.

217
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Thanks.

218
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Are you hurt?

219
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
I'm fine.

220
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Thanks for saving me.

221
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
Zhao Yan is still polite to me.

222
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
No.

223
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
How are you?

224
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I love you, Miss Min.

225
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Thank you.

226
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
How is it?

227
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Better.

228
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Better?

229
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Jinzhao.

230
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
When you ask me,

231
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I'll tell you when we're alone.

232
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I didn't expect that

233
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
I came to Wuyan Village

234
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
without any success.

235
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
I almost died.

236
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
It's not a success.

237
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
Uncle Lin Yue.

238
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Lin Yue.

239
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Who told you to attack them?

240
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Commander Ke.

241
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
I didn't mean to hurt them.

242
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
I just want to trap them in the cave

243
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
and try to get the last dragon crystal.

244
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,900
Who knew General Lin Yue would show up?

245
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Lin Yue must have followed us.

246
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
The Sea of Heaven and Mirror

247
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
must have found us collecting the crystal

248
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
and will add more room for us.

249
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm sorry for my bad.

250
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
I have to go back

251
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
and report this to boss.

252
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Since the crystal is not enough,

253
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
you can withdraw the jade scroll immediately.

254
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Yes.

255
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Uncle Lin Yue.

256
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Where am I?

257
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Just confess.

258
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
What do I confess?

259
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
What do you mean?

260
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
It hurts me.

261
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
What's your relationship with Shuo Xuan?

262
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
What are you talking about?

263
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
I don't know what you mean.

264
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Who is Shuo Xuan?

265
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
You...

266
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
You still don't want to confess?

267
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
It seems that I can't keep it from you.

268
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Young Master.

269
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Please forgive me for my rudeness.

270
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Me?

271
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Qi Ya Tou

272
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
is actually the Young Master of the Yu Clan.

273
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Yu?

274
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
What?

275
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
Yu... Yu Clan?

276
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Yu Clan

277
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
is a sea monster living in the Sea of Heaven and Mirror.

278
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Miss Yue.

279
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
It's a monster?

280
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
But Xiao Yue has no demon spirit.

281
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Our Yu Clan's emperor, Zhu Yu,

282
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
is an ancient beast.

283
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Since ancient times,

284
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
there is no other monster clan.

285
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
You said Qi is your emperor's ancestor.

286
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Then why did you lose him in the human world?

287
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Three years.

288
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I don't care.

289
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Three years.

290
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
I don't care.

291
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
The Young Master was lost in the human world.

292
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
He became an ordinary person.

293
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
That's the punishment from His Majesty to the Young Master.

294
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Punishment?

295
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Then...

296
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Then what did Xiao Yue do wrong?

297
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,900
There is a forbidden skill in our Yu Clan.

298
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
It's the skill of naming the moon to protect the life.

299
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
If you use this skill on someone,

300
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
that person will lose his memory.

301
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,900
And he will kill his previous character.

302
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
From then on,

303
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
he will live for the master.

304
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
His life's mission

305
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
is to protect the master.

306
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
No personality.

307
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
No memory.

308
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
From now on,

309
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
he will live for another person.

310
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Yes.

311
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Three years ago,

312
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
the Young Master traveled all over the world.

313
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
When passing by the Wu Yan Village,

314
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
he accidentally used the skill of protection

315
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
on a human.

316
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
The skill of protecting the life

317
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
is already lost.

318
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
It can't be broken.

319
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
Although His Majesty adores the Young Master,

320
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
he made such a big mistake.

321
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
He must be punished.

322
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
His Majesty removed the skill.

323
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
He made you a white paper.

324
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,900
You should practice your mind and body in the human world.

325
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,900
Is that human boy

326
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Yue Xiong?

327
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
For the past three years,

328
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
we have been looking for the source of Yue's character.

329
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
But your identity and background are very mysterious.

330
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
We didn't know it until now.

331
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Now,

332
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
we can only put you and the Young Master

333
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
in the Wu Yan Village.

334
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
His Majesty is worried about your safety.

335
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
He asked me and Shuo Xuan to protect you secretly.

336
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Did you find a person

337
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
who looks exactly like Jingzhao?

338
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Jingzhao.

339
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
I want to go to the Sea of ​​Tianqing.

340
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
That's good.

341
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,900
His Majesty also cares about you.

342
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I will go too.

343
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Then we will go together.

344
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
You all have to follow the demon

345
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,900
to the Demon Realm.

346
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
We are friends first.

347
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
We will go together.

348
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
I will go with you.

349
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
I will go with you.

350
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I will go with you.

351
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
The second time is the difference between human and demon.

352
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Xiong.

353
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Han Jiangxiong usually can't bear to teach Xiong.

354
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
If he wants to let him know

355
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
that Xiong doesn't care about his companions,

356
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
he will be punished.

357
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
I will go with you.

358
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I will go with you.

359
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
I will go with you.

360
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I will go with you.

361
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
I will go with you.

362
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
I will go with you.

363
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
I will go with you.

364
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
I will go with you.

365
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
I will go with you.

366
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
I will go with you.

367
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
I will go with you.

368
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
I will go with you.

369
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
I will go with you.

370
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,900
I will go with you.

371
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
I will go with you.

372
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
I will go with you.

373
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
I will go with you.

374
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
I will go with you.

375
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
I will go with you.

376
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I will go with you.

377
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,900
I will go with you.

378
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
I will go with you.

379
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I will go with you.

380
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I will go with you.

381
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
I will go with you.

382
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
I will go with you.

383
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I will go with you.

384
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Are you annoying?

385
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
No.

386
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
Xiao Xiu, you finally smiled.

387
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
I don't want to talk to you.

388
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Isn't this a matter of manners?

389
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Uncle knows

390
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,900
that your mother was killed by the demon.

391
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
You have been only talking about killing the demon all these years.

392
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
That's because I was still young at that time.

393
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
I didn't have the ability to protect her.

394
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
But now,

395
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
I will never allow the demon to cause trouble in front of me.

396
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
But Xiao Xiu,

397
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
you don't want to know about the demon

398
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
even if you want to eradicate it.

399
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,900
Do you know

400
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,900
that knowing yourself and your opponent

401
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,900
can make you win in every battle?

402
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
You are making excuses.

403
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
When you reach the level of the fish clan,

404
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
you should be more disciplined.

405
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I know.

406
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
I am not an idiot.

407
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Xiao Xiu, you are not.

408
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
You...

409
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
You are not.

410
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
You are not.

411
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Jin Zhao.

412
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
If Lin Yuan said...

413
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
No.

414
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Lin Yuan is telling the truth.

415
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
Then I am the one

416
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
who made you lose your memory.

417
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I am sorry.

418
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Idiot.

419
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Didn't you say that too?

420
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Lin Yuan's words

421
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
may not be true.

422
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
Everyone, look.

423
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
What is that?

424
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Oh my god.

425
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
I am not wrong, right?

426
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,900
There is a city in the sky.

427
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
You are not wrong.

428
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
That is the sea of heaven.

429
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
The home of the fish clan.

430
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
I will go and call Miss Xian Qing and Miss Ming.

431
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Is this really my home?

432
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
I am sorry.

433
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
I am sorry.

434
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Is this really my home?

435
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
It seems to be a little bit off.

436
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
The sea of heaven

437
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
was originally a pearl on the sea.

438
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
But it was in great danger a decade ago.

439
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
It caused great damage to the original spirit of our fish clan.

440
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
So far,

441
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
we are all resting and enjoying life.

442
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
What kind of disaster is this?

443
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Shuang Jun, you will know it in the future.

444
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,900
Hello.

445
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Little Shifang,

446
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
this is a special gift for a girl in our clan.

447
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
But as a man,

448
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
is Miss Shuo Xuan here too?

449
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
I didn't expect that Mr. Ju

450
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
would be such a kind person.

451
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
It seems that there are still

452
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
people that Little Shifang misses in the sea of heaven.

453
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Everyone,

454
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
when you arrive at the hall,

455
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
you will meet our king

456
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
and also Shuo Xuan.

457
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Please.

458
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
This is the entrance

459
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
to the sea of heaven.

460
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,900
Everyone, follow me.

461
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
Miss Shuo Xuan?

462
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,900
Long time no see.

463
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
Your Majesty.

464
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
This is the king of our fish clan,

465
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Zhu Yu.

466
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I feel so familiar.

467
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Please.

468
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
Are you

469
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,900
my mother?

470
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
It hurts.

471
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,900
It doesn't seem to hurt anymore.

472
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Qi,

473
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
you are growing up.

474
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Shuang Jun,

475
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
the blood of Kun

476
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
is flowing in your body.

477
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Now the soul film is growing out,

478
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
it means that your divine power

479
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
has awakened.

480
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Kun,

481
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
the name is different.

482
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Qi is called Kun.

483
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Are you really Qi's bride?

484
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Qi is my old surname.

485
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,900
Then I

486
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,900
really am Qi's godfather?

487
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Your Majesty,

488
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
it is I who without your permission

489
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
will tell you

490
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
how to protect yourself.

491
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Later,

492
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
I will explain to

493
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Shao Jun and Yue Xiao in person.

494
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
I will explain to Yue Xiao.

495
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
This matter

496
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
concerns the secret of my Tian Qing Sea.

497
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Please take a step.

498
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
In this case,

499
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
we will leave first.

500
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Shuo Xuan,

501
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
take them to the guest room.

502
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Follow me.

503
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
I don't believe what you said.

504
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Where is the evidence?

505
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Yue Xiao,

506
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
the power of you and Shao Jun

507
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
is the best evidence.

508
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
Moreover,

509
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
the power of you and Shao Jun

510
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
is mutual.

511
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,900
In the past,

512
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Shao Jun was young

513
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
and lacked enough power.

514
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
That is why

515
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,900
he used the power of the body

516
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
to protect himself.

517
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
The heart has the spiritual power.

518
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
The heart has the spiritual power.

519
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
It is caused by the body.

520
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,900
It is caused by the body.

521
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Shao Jun.

522
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
His Majesty knew that you were coming back.

523
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
He prepared a special ceremony.

524
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
Shao Jun has not returned for three years.

525
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
All the people are waiting to see you.

526
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
Qing,

527
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
it is a happy thing

528
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
to find your family.

529
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,900
Be good to your mother.

530
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I will.

531
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Your Majesty.

532
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
By His Majesty's order,

533
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,900
before the ceremony,

534
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Shao Jun will be dressed up.

535
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Why did you dress me up like this?

536
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Because you are going to the ceremony.

537
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
I don't want to attend that ceremony.

538
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
I want to find Jinzhao.

539
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
Shao Jun is talking about

540
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
that human brother.

541
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
Shao Jun

542
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
wants him to be your future empress.

543
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Empress?

544
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Empress is

545
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,900
someone who will be with Shao Jun forever.

546
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Someone who can share good fortune and

547
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,900
share difficulties.

548
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
I want Jinzhao to be my empress.

549
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,900
I want to be with him forever.

550
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
I don't know if he is willing to do that.

551
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
As far as I know,

552
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,900
no one wants to be an empress.

553
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
Really?

554
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
But

555
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,900
it doesn't matter if he doesn't want to.

556
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
We, the Sea of Heaven,

557
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
will definitely choose a

558
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
empress who can be with Shao Jun forever.

559
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,900
No need.

560
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,900
I only want Jinzhao.

561
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Jinzhao.

562
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Jinzhao.

563
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Jinzhao.

564
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
Jinzhao.

565
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
Are you willing to be my empress?

566
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Xi Luo said

567
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
that being my empress

568
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
means being together forever.

569
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Someone who can share good fortune and

570
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
share difficulties.

571
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,900
If you are willing,

572
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
then be my empress.

573
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
From now on,

574
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
we can be together forever.

575
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Now we have money and identity.

576
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
After eating a bowl of noodles,

577
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
we can have ten eggs.

578
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Jinzhao,

579
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
what's wrong?

580
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Are you worried about your protection?

581
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,900
It's okay.

582
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
From now on, I will be your protection.

583
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
I will protect you.

584
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,900
I just want to

585
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
be with you

586
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,900
as Yue Jinzhao.

587
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Jinzhao,

588
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
are you blaming me

589
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,900
for ruining your memory?

590
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,900
Of course not.

591
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,900
When I was in Kuangdong,

592
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,900
my only thought

593
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,900
was to be with you forever.

594
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
But...

595
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
But now I can't be sure.

596
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
What can't you be sure about?

597
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
I can't be sure

598
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
if my feelings for you

599
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
are out of my nature

600
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,900
or

601
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,900
the influence of the magic of life.

602
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Flowers bloom and wither.

603
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
I and Sheng

604
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
are we

605
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
in love?

606
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Of course.

607
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
I miss you.

608
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,900
I miss you.

609
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
I miss you.

610
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
I miss you.

611
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
I miss you.

612
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Your Majesty,

613
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
I think there are many places

614
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
that Qi Yuan Sect has been in a series of ups and downs.

615
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
I think it's strange.

616
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,900
I followed Ge Qingfei from the Hengdao Sect

617
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,900
to Wuyan Village.

618
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,900
I didn't expect

619
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
to be exposed by Yue Jinzhao and others.

620
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
In order to keep the truth,

621
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,900
I had to

622
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
use the word protection.

623
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,900
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

624
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,900
It's okay.

625
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,900
If not,

626
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
I can't recognize Qi Yuan Sect.

627
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,900
But

628
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
I can't tell him the truth now.

629
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm afraid

630
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
he can't bear it.

631
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Your Majesty.

632
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
