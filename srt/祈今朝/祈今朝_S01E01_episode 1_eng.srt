1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:25,000


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,736
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,500
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,400
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,200
   

19
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:02,727
 Legend has it that Lord Ming is the ancient behemoth Kun. 

20
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,487
 It roams the world above the clouds, 

21
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:10,311
 possessing the power to destroy the world. 
   

22
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:15,606
 The human sect, Qiyuan Sect, reveres Lord Ming and brings calamity to humanity. 

23
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:20,386
 The major sects led by Luo Mansion searched everywhere for Lord Ming, 

24
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:23,200
 wishing to vanquish it. 

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,800
 Lord Ming, having absorbed a vast amount of dark energy, is about to lose control. 

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,800
 Many civilians who believed in the Qiyuan Sect were turned into stone. 

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,000
 A great catastrophe is imminent upon the world. 

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,600
   

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
It's almost time.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,900
Xiao Huan, seal away Qi's memories

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,300
and send her to the Mortal Realm.

32
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:57,746
The hope of saving all beings in the future is now on her.

33
00:03:58,187 --> 00:04:00,987
Master, I know it's you.

34
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:06,947
Master, stop hiding. Hurry, come out.

35
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,507
Has Commander Ying agreed to take us to the human world?

36
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:27,346
Master, what's wrong with you? You're acting strange today.

37
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:34,166
Qi, your thought sword originates from thoughts.

38
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,806
Do you know your mission behind that sword?

39
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,287
My mission behind the sword?

40
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,886
Does carrying a sword mean I must kill people?

41
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:47,427
But I don't want to kill anyone.

42
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:54,466
Master, what do you want to do?

43
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:06,266
Master, what are you going to do?

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,700
   

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,500
 Master, I know it's you. 

46
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,900
 Master, stop hiding. Hurry, come out. 

47
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,400
 Qi... 

48
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
 Qi. 

49
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Qi. Qi, wake up.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,700
Awake?

51
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:44,386
Yue... Jin...

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,200
zhao!

53
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:51,692
What are you doing? Why did you pinch me?

54
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,106
   

55
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,787
I dreamed of my master again.

56
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,447
If you hadn't suddenly interrupted, I would've clearly seen what he looked like.

57
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:02,106
Enough. You say this every time. If you could see him, you would have a while ago.

58
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm guessing your master doesn't exist at all.

59
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Who says he doesn't exist?

60
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,400
If he doesn't exist, where did I learn those moves from?

61
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:18,506
Yue Qi, I worked really hard to take care of you for three years,

62
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:22,128
but I can't hold a candle to your faceless master. 
    

63
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:31,387
Talk nicely. Don't use violence.

64
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,186
I must use violence, I will!

65
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,586
I will!

66
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,387
I'm going to smack you.

67
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,726
I'm your elder brother!

68
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,507
Who says you're older than me?

69
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,947
Three years ago, when we woke up in Wuyan Village,

70
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,466
neither of us remembered what happened before.

71
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:52,746
Also, it was you who said that our birthdays were on the same day.

72
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:59,206
You don't understand anything else, but you remember this clearly.

73
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:03,626
Well, today is the 14th day of the 7th month, our birthday.

74
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,547
So, what should we eat?

75
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:06,706
Egg noodles?

76
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,126
Let's go!

77
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,787
Here, enjoy your meal.

78
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,507
- A bowl of egg noodles, please. 
 - Without green onions.

79
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:18,987
Okay!

80
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Qi, your hair rope is so worn out. Let's replace it.

81
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
I can't throw it away.

82
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
I was wearing it when I woke up.

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,200
It might be related to my background.

84
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
Maybe my master gave it to me.

85
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
I really do hope you have a master.

86
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,600
That way, we would have a clue about our origins.

87
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
I really did dream of him.

88
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,900
It's just that, in my dream, I couldn't see his face.

89
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,100
Nor remember what he said.

90
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,700
But I was thinking...

91
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,000
- thinking... 
 - Your noodles are here.

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Thinking what?

93
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:57,967
Enjoy.

94
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,100
I must be hungry!

95
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,000
What are you doing?

96
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,600
Jinzhao, you said you were older than me.

97
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Show me some love.

98
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
The same old rules. Whoever grabs it get to eat it.

99
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:54,107
You said it. Whoever grabs it first gets it.

100
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:56,327
You eat it.

101
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,327
Why aren't you eating?

102
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,626
Yue Jinzhao, are you serious?

103
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,987
Do you have to use Mindlink to snatch an egg?

104
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,688
   

105
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,687
You're cheating. You learned to be bad!

106
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:36,666
I learned that from you!

107
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,026
This bowl of noodles is mine now.

108
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,687
Why do you love egg noodles so much?

109
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,766
Because it is the first food you ever made for me.

110
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,400
Qi, eat slower. Leave some soup for me.

111
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,300
Time to work.

112
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,600
I drew this last night.

113
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
This is the person I saw with my left eye.

114
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
Wow, are these scribbles?

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,400
What? What scribbles?

116
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,300
This captures both the person's spirit and looks. Okay?

117
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
It can ward off evil.

118
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,747
Stop joking around.

119
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:36,667
Compared to your dream, my left eye is more reliable.

120
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,304
Every time the trail goes cold,

121
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,946
my left eye always manages to foresee something, although...

122
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:46,007
Although the price of seeing the future is intense pain in your left eye.

123
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,347
I can recite these words of yours by heart now.

124
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,486
Why do you care?

125
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:54,700
Anyway, this time in Yinghui Fort, we have to find this man in red.

126
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,240
No matter what, we must find him.

127
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,400
   

128
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:24,906
Jinzhao, you haven't given me this year's birthday present yet.

129
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,500
It's all yours. Buy whatever.

130
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,200
Why are you so generous today?

131
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,400
Yue Jinzhao, you don't plan to give me a birthday present, is that it?

132
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
No, I'm out of money.

133
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
If we keep going like this, we'll go bankrupt.

134
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Think about it. Inn costs aside, last night we had two large bowls of beef noodles.

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,800
That was eight coins.

136
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
You're a glutton, so we spent another five coins.

137
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,100
In the end, you even took a chestnut cake.

138
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,200
Most importantly, you were still hungry and ate another two bowls of egg noodles!

139
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,500
We're out of money.

140
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
So, we must find this person first.

141
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
I've calculated it.

142
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,400
With our pace, within two hours, we can run through the entire Yinghui Fort.

143
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,400
Although it's a foolish method.

144
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,700
Then you come up with a smart way.

145
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,246
Let's go.

146
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Start from this point and meet here in two hours.

147
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,200
Got it, Smelly Jinzhao.

148
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,500
Have a look. Top-notch jewelry. Miss.

149
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,600
- Sir, how much is this? 
 - 10 coins.

150
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,500
10 coins?

151
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,200
More expensive than two bowls of beef noodles.

152
00:12:57,706 --> 00:13:01,307
That annoying guy didn't give me money. Stupid Jinzhao.

153
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,000
   

154
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:09,747
Recruiting mourners, 3 meals included,

155
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,630
10 coins a day.

156
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,400
Exactly.

157
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
I want to make money.

158
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,100
All right. Just try crying.

159
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,700
Okay.

160
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:27,987
I can't cry. How do I cry?

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Just cry like you did when your family died.

162
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,700
I don't have a family.

163
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,800
You don't have a family. Isn't that very pitiful?

164
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
But I've got Jinzhao. I'm not pitiful at all.

165
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,900
That said, after a person dies,

166
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,600
they enter the cycle of reincarnation, which means starting over again.

167
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Why should I cry?

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,800
This girl doesn't seem like a normal person.

169
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Miss, you should be on your way.

170
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:53,146
Oh, no! The horse was spooked!

171
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,347
Are you all right?

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,500
Child, are you okay?

173
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,900
    
 Thank you very much. Thank her.

174
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Master, are you okay?

175
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,000
Go check if anyone was injured and check the damage to the shops.

176
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Yes!

177
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,600
Sorry, Miss. That horse belongs to my family.

178
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,500
It got startled just now. Thank you for your help.

179
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,900
Red clothes. High ponytail.

180
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,107
Miss?

181
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:03,506
But you're much prettier than the picture.

182
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:10,506
This is a thank-you gift. Please accept it.

183
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
Thank you, sir. You're so generous,

184
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
but ten coins will be enough for me.

185
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,700
This is what you deserve for your kindness.

186
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,400
I have to go. Goodbye.

187
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,200
There were no white ones left. This green one is okay. Right?

188
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,500
 Great Lord Ming, blessings upon all beings. 

189
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,200
Our sect serves Lord Ming and makes people happy!

190
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,700
Anyone who asks shall receive! Don't you agree?

191
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,100
Anyone shall receive? 
    

192
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,300
 - We tell the masses...  
 - Let me go take a look.

193
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,800
 Can the Qiyuan Sect help me and Jinzhao find our origins? 

194
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 - May Lord Ming bless us! 
 - May Lord Ming bless us! 

195
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Master Meng, why aren't the two people who Lord Shengxuan invited here yet?

196
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,900
What's the rush?

197
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
The faith in Lord Ming is very strong!

198
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,200
He is now traveling the world and blessing us all from afar.

199
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,800
We should pay even more homage to Lord Ming!

200
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
May Lord Ming bless us!

201
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
 - May Lord Ming bless us!  
 - Hasn't one just arrived?

202
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,700
May Lord Ming bless us!

203
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,200
Miss, you don't look familiar.  
  - May Lord Ming bless us! 

204
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Is it your first time hearing about our sect?

205
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Who are you?

206
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
    
 I am Meng Cheng.

207
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm an emissary of the Qiyuan Sect.

208
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,700
I've forgotten my past. Can you tell me about it?

209
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,300
Your past? That's a piece of cake.

210
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,200
To tell you the truth, I'm proficient in Qiyuan's magic spells.

211
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Magic spells?

212
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,700
Then can you tell me about my origins?

213
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:54,006
Please wait.

214
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,146
We agreed to meet here.

215
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:08,466
Where did Qi run off to now?

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,900
Qi's over there.

217
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
I see it.

218
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,600
You must come from a rich or noble family,

219
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,000
and you snuck out to have fun without your family's knowledge.

220
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,500
You're wrong.

221
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
If I were of wealth or nobility, why hasn't my family come looking for me?

222
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,400
Well... haven't you forgotten all about your past?

223
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,100
How do you know I'm wrong then?

224
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,800
Moreover, our Qiyuan's Lord Ming is omniscient towards all matters in the world.

225
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,300
He certainly wouldn't be wrong.

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,700
Then tell me, where is my family right now?

227
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,200
Miss, your faith is insufficient.

228
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,500
I can't divine any further for you.

229
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,400
You simply don't know.

230
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,700
Not so.

231
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,000
Insufficient faith means that you don't have enough merit yet.

232
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,700
But today, if you offer a small amount of gold and silver to Lord Ming,

233
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,000
you can increase your connection with him.

234
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Then I'll be able to divine for you.

235
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,900
Look! So many people are accumulating merits.

236
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,600
You should go now, or it'll be too late.

237
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,500
 Believe the Qiyuan Sect and receive Lord Ming's blessing! 

238
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,400
Pay homage to Lord Ming to accumulate merits.

239
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,466
Pay homage to Lord Ming.

240
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Miss, I've been investigating this sect.

241
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,400
The so-called merits are just a means for them to collect money. Don't be fooled.

242
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Nonsense. They bring the people benefits.

243
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
- We make these donations voluntarily to Lord Ming. 
 - Yes!

244
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
- Exactly. 
 - We do it voluntarily!

245
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,100
- It's voluntary. 
 - Voluntary.

246
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,900
   

247
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:19,440
   

248
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:21,747
 Let's set off. 

249
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
 All right. 

250
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
 It's him. He's the key to finding our origins. 

251
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,100
 We must find a way to gain his trust. 

252
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,200
Your merit is respectable.

253
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,200
This person slanders our sect with malicious intent. Stop him!

254
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
- Stop him! 
 - That's right!

255
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
How could the Qiyuan Sect be slandered at will?

256
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,400
Who is this?

257
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Jinzhao!

258
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
Who might you be?

259
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm just an ordinary man who rights wrongs, promotes goodness,

260
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,800
and is determined to uphold the honor of the sect.

261
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Emissary Meng, isn't this the other person from the portrait?

262
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Isn't this a good thing?

263
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,500
   
   

264
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,200
No big deal, no big deal.

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,000
This young man really speaks the truth. Well said.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Everything is thanks to Lord Ming's blessing.

267
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
That's correct!

268
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,100
- May Lord Ming bless us! 
  - May Lord Ming bless us! 

269
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:25,600
 - May Lord Ming bless us! 
 - May Lord Ming bless us! 

270
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,500
In my pursuit here, I've seen the Qiyuan Sect harming lives.

271
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,100
Lord Ming is the chief culprit.

272
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I won't allow anyone to be an accomplice to evil!

273
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
You keep insulting the Qiyuan Sect.

274
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,000
You're the one to blame.

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
Emissary Meng, I'll definitely teach him a good lesson!

276
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Good. May Lord Ming bless you. He'll help you punish this hellion.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,900
Sir, why not join our sect and you can ascend?

278
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,700
Is it a real fight, Jinzhao?

279
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,000
Of course. Let's go!

280
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,626
Jinzhao!

281
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:26,316
   

282
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,186
- Jinzhao! 
 - This place is dangerous.

283
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,027
- Emissary Meng, please retreat. 
 - A-Alright.

284
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:55,306
Wait a moment!

285
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,627
You said we should join the sect. Was that true?

286
00:21:57,627 --> 00:21:59,267
I'll wait for you at the Fujin Hall later.

287
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,447
All right, then I'll deal with this madman first.

288
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,407
Hold this.

289
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,580
   

290
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,706
 This girl is so strong. 

291
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:52,027
Qi, stop.

292
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,586
Buddy, my apologies for offending you just now.

293
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,927
What do you mean?

294
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:01,867
The audience has left. Why keep acting?

295
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:07,867
You did it on purpose.

296
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:10,167
Jinzhao is good at acting and deceiving others.

297
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,691
You're not embarrassed? How can you be so gullible?

298
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,846
You really are naive.

299
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:16,147
Who says I was deceived?

300
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,666
That bag just now was filled with stones.

301
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,347
Not a single coin in it.

302
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:22,726
All the coins are here.

303
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:25,347
Since when did you learn to play tricks on people?

304
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:28,466
You were the one who tricked me with stones first.

305
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:36,206
Sorry. Just now, I thought you were really going to give money to them.

306
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,546
No, I wasn't. And I didn't expect to inadvertently deceive them.

307
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,987
You're truly adorable.

308
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,466
You have good taste.

309
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:46,627
My name is Yue Qi. This is Yue Jinzhao.

310
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,066
My name is Luo Zhaoyan.

311
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,886
The head of the Luo family?

312
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,907
Although we've only been at Yinghui Fort for two days,

313
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:59,227
we've heard that for centuries, your family has been protecting the nearby residents

314
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:01,147
and is much loved.

315
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:05,526
I've heard a storyteller say that your family is known as the Twilight Luo Family.

316
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:10,086
Twins in your family all pass away before reaching their twenties or thirties.

317
00:24:10,086 --> 00:24:13,227
I'm sorry. She's immature and doesn't think when she speaks.

318
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:14,786
Please understand.

319
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,047
It's okay. Everyone knows it.

320
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:21,306
I've gotten used to such words.

321
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,547
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

322
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,444
You two. The Qiyuan Sect schemes for money and hurts people,

323
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:30,336
but the mastermind, Lord Ming, stays hidden.

324
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,404
It's a real maze of secrets.

325
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,627
I just saw her talking with Meng Cheng and was worried she'd fall for it, so I took action.

326
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:39,366
How dare the Qiyuan Sect deceive us?

327
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:40,867
Consider it their bad luck.

328
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:43,907
Since our goal is the same, how about joining forces?

329
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:48,786
They've been gone for a while. If we wait any longer, we won't catch them.

330
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:51,987
Thanks for the help, then.

331
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:59,226
Qi, he's the one I saw with my left eye.

332
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:02,727
Watch him.

333
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,766
- Okay, I'll definitely keep a close eye on him. 
 - Let's go.

334
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:14,767
Miss Yue.

335
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:16,367
What?

336
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:20,666
Nothing. Nothing...

337
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:25,107
Brother Luo Luo, how old are you and where is your home?

338
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,606
How many in your family? Are you married?

339
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,706
She doesn't mean that.

340
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,307
- That's exactly what I mean. 
 - Do you know what you're saying?

341
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:37,166
Am I not asking for his information?

342
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:42,766
Brother Yue, I know Miss Yue definitely has no interest in me.

343
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:46,147
No, no, I am interested in you.

344
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:50,547
I... I-I-I'm really a boring man.

345
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:53,586
Brother Luo, he has entered Fujin Hall.

346
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:57,326
If we want to find out whether this is a stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect or not,

347
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:59,666
we'll have to go in first.

348
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,867
It seems you have a clever plan.

349
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:05,147
I just gained that person's trust.

350
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,887
I plan to pretend to join them to see if he can take me inside.

351
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:11,580
But before that, could you lend me some money?

352
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,966
Here.

353
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:18,586
What about mine?

354
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:20,347
Right, what about hers?

355
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,867
It's up to you two.

356
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:27,306
I'll assist out here. If you two need me, call me.

357
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:29,546
Of course. Let's go.

358
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:42,706
You almost drove Luo Zhaoyan away just now. Do you know that?

359
00:26:42,706 --> 00:26:45,227
But that's how it's written in the storybooks.

360
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:48,867
That's what a matchmaker asks. Are you going to marry him?

361
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:53,446
Brother Luo Luo is dashing and awe-inspiring, with unyielding integrity.

362
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,206
And he gave us two gold leaves. What a good choice for a husband.

363
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,167
His name is Luo Zhaoyan.

364
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:02,247
You can respectfully address him as Master Luo or call him Brother Luo affectionately

365
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,387
or at least call him Brother Zhaoyan. What does Brother Luo Luo mean?

366
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:07,826
Because it represents his good manners.

367
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:18,246
All right. Since you don't like me calling him that, I won't call him that anymore.

368
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:22,127
If you don't want me to ask questions, then I won't ask again either.

369
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,386
Little flatterer.

370
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:32,207
He's come out. Let's go.

371
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:34,586
Emissary Meng.

372
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:38,186
May Lord Ming bless us.

373
00:27:38,186 --> 00:27:40,946
Seeing you two safe and sound puts me at ease.

374
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:43,627
Did you punish that villain?

375
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:48,206
Even though he got something, we still managed to drive him off!

376
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,767
What's that? It's all thanks to Lord Ming's protection.

377
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:54,746
Emissary Meng, you said earlier you would let us join your sect. Is that true?

378
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,786
Of course, it's true.

379
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,706
You two are truly loyal to Lord Ming.

380
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:01,247
You will surely receive his grace.

381
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,087
Thank you, Emissary Meng. This is a little token of my appreciation.

382
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:06,827
Please accept it.

383
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:09,267
You don't have to.

384
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:14,706
Qi, you're being naughty again.

385
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,426
Emissary Meng.

386
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:24,627
Emissary Meng, we sincerely wish to join the sect.

387
00:28:24,627 --> 00:28:28,907
Since you seem to understand, follow me.

388
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,227
 Take care, sir. 

389
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:54,426
 These flowers look so strange. 

390
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:57,826
Don't just randomly smell things. What if it's poisonous?

391
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:59,227
Let's go.

392
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:14,407
Qi, look. These statues, they're just like real people.

393
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,946
It's too eerie.

394
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:19,326
What craftsmanship!

395
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:22,247
Each of these stone statues is unique.

396
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,507
- So interesting. 
 - Don't touch it!

397
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:29,227
These were the followers who were fortunate enough to ascend.

398
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,747
These were all real people?

399
00:29:32,907 --> 00:29:37,047
Emissary Meng, this is the ascension as practiced by our sect?

400
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:42,507
Not just anyone is eligible and fortunate enough to ascend.

401
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:46,786
Aside from Minister Gao Xiao, even I have to put in extra effort.

402
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:49,387
Minister? What minister?

403
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,726
You're not aware of this, are you?

404
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:54,786
Beneath our Lord Ming is Shengxuan.

405
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,347
Shengxuan conveys the lord's command to the sect leader.

406
00:29:57,347 --> 00:29:59,706
The sect leader oversees the ministers of various regions.

407
00:29:59,706 --> 00:30:01,666
Under the ministers are emissaries such as me.

408
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:06,186
Each emissary is responsible for leading and managing the disciples.

409
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:14,606
I understand now. So the sect in the Yinghui Fort is governed by Minister Gao Xiao.

410
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,460
That's right.

411
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:18,466
The laws are strict and clear.

412
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,706
It's worthy of a large sect with followers everywhere!

413
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:23,267
Qi! We've found ourselves a big backer!

414
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:27,486
The sect is amazing, and Emissary Meng is also impressive.

415
00:30:27,486 --> 00:30:29,007
Let's go.

416
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:38,667
 I found you. Qi. 

417
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,164
   

418
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:57,086
A big flying fish.

419
00:30:57,086 --> 00:31:00,107
What big fish? Such lack of experience.

420
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:04,927
This is the ancient divine beast worshipped by our sect, Kun.

421
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:17,586
Qi, what's wrong?

422
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:21,627
Why does this feel somewhat familiar?

423
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,786
Done!

424
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:34,007
Emissary Meng, what's this for? How have we offended you?

425
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:39,147
Though the two of you are quite skilled, your brains...

426
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:47,387
Emissary Meng, we sincerely wish to join your sect.

427
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,206
Why did you lock us up?

428
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:53,826
Miss, you'll have to ask Lord Shengxuan about that.

429
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,186
Lord Shengxuan?

430
00:31:57,186 --> 00:31:58,666
Farewell.

431
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,227
- Emissary Meng. 
 - Emissary Meng. Emissary Meng!

432
00:32:06,566 --> 00:32:10,887
Jinzhao, why do I feel he deliberately lured us here?

433
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,186
Me too.

434
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:15,886
But don't worry. We'll get help soon.

435
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:26,087
Mini—

436
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,367
Minister Gao.

437
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:38,180
Minister Gao.

438
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,228
   

439
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:45,907
Minister Gao!

440
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:53,426
Damn you! Are you on fire or what?

441
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,906
- Be ruthless in deed and calm in character. 
 - Yes.

442
00:32:57,906 --> 00:33:00,347
What's going on? Take your time.

443
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:02,666
Lord Shengxuan ordered me to capture two people.

444
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,426
I effortlessly led them here.

445
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:07,347
What?

446
00:33:07,347 --> 00:33:09,367
- Take it slow. 
 - It's all right.

447
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,267
My legs are numb.

448
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,267
Say that again. What did you just say?

449
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,966
I locked them in the passageway.

450
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:19,607
Good job! I'll credit you for this.

451
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:23,087
I'll go report it to Lord Shengxuan.

452
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:29,586
No need, Gao Xiao. We're here.

453
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,627
Wait! Didn't you say it was two people?

454
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,766
But there are three.

455
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:42,946
Aren't you that madman?

456
00:33:42,946 --> 00:33:44,227
You!

457
00:33:45,266 --> 00:33:48,407
The three of you conspired to deceive me?!

458
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,407
I feel sorry for you.

459
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:53,367
Guards! Attack!

460
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:47,467
I-I-I'll go call for help. I'm going to get help.

461
00:34:52,147 --> 00:34:56,107
You're unlucky to have meet our Qi.

462
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,127
Hero, please spare my life! Spare my life!

463
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:13,786
When you did those harmful misdeeds, did you ever imagine this day?

464
00:35:13,786 --> 00:35:18,547
Don't-Don't-Don't come over here!

465
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:29,466
You! Y-Y-You useless thing!

466
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:30,946
Why are you panicking?

467
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:33,586
I've been running this Fujin Hall for countless years.

468
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,836
How dare you ruffians run wild here?

469
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:39,455
Today, I'm going to wreck this place of yours.

470
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:52,367
Jinzhao!

471
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:54,826
Qi!

472
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:57,967
Jinzhao. Jinzhao!

473
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,506
Miss Yue.

474
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:10,487
What have you done to Qi?

475
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:14,526
She... I...

476
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:23,867
They've merged... They've merged!

477
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:26,626
Only Lord Ming can merge with the soul fish.

478
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:28,867
Lord Ming.

479
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:32,307
Lord Ming has appeared!

480
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:37,867
 May Lord Ming bless us. 

481
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,106
Lord Ming, you saw us in a perilous situation,

482
00:36:42,106 --> 00:36:45,087
so you came out to guide us!

483
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:49,106
No, I'm not Lord Ming. I'm not!

484
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,387
Jinzhao, think of something!

485
00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:52,946
Qi.

486
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,086
 Jinzhao. 

487
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,406
 Jinzhao. 

488
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,147
 Jinzhao. 

489
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:33,986
 Jinzhao! 

490
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:44,907
 Jinzhao. Jinzhao! 

491
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:56,247
 Qi. 

492
00:37:56,247 --> 00:37:59,347
 Qi, hurry, come back. 

493
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:00,406
 Come back to me, Qi. 

494
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:02,746
 - Who are you? 
 - Don't listen to her. 

495
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,007
 Qi, don't listen to her! 

496
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,066
 - Jinzhao. 
 - Don't listen to her. 

497
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,347
 Jinzhao abandoned you. 

498
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,767
 - No! 
 - Jinzhao has abandoned you. 

499
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,406
 - Who are you? 
 - Jinzhao abandoned you. 

500
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:13,207
 Don't listen to her. 

501
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,826
 I won't deceive you. 

502
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,667
 Qi, quick come back to me! 

503
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,307
 Qi! 

504
00:38:18,307 --> 00:38:20,067
 - Jinzhao abandoned you. 
 - Qi! 

505
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,306
 Jinzhao abandoned you. 

506
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:35,030


507
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,244
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

508
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:06,308
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

509
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:10,552
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

510
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:18,276
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

511
00:39:18,276 --> 00:39:22,120
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

512
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,368
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

513
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:35,076
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

514
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:43,364
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

515
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:51,300
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

516
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:59,076
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

517
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:20,260
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

518
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,260
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

519
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,644
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

520
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:36,292
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

521
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:45,228
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

522
00:40:45,228 --> 00:40:53,284
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

523
00:40:53,284 --> 00:41:01,392
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

524
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:09,384
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

525
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:17,216
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

526
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:25,216
♫  I'm destined to give my all for you  ♫

527
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:33,380
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

528
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:41,444
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

529
00:41:41,444 --> 00:41:51,380
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫
