YoYo English Channel YouTube

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Since its birth,

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we've been avoiding

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
any involvement with Zhuyu.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This time,

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
their mother and daughter have agreed to be together.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm afraid that this situation will be bad for us.

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I was careless.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I never thought that

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Lin Yuan

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
would keep coming to the Wuyuan Village.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The Sea of Heaven and Love

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
has already known that we are collecting dragon gold.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They are afraid that they have already figured out

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that dragon gold will be used to deal with them.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's okay.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
For so many years,

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
haven't we been

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
trying to test each other

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
with the Sea of Heaven and Love?

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Actually, what I'm more worried about is

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that the Sea of Heaven and Love

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
will tell Yue Jingzhao his background.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I believe that before Zhuyu

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
has found a way to

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
save the fish tribe,

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
he will still abide by

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
our agreement.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I really want to tell Yue Jingzhao.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But Yue Jingzhao already knows

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that he looks the same as our third brother.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And he can

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
follow the Qiyuan Sect

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to chase us here.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We are not ready yet.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then let's speed up the plan and deal with the Qiyuan Sect as soon as possible.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Qiyuan Sect is strong enough anyway.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You haven't recovered yet.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why did you come here?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was careless before.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I made Jingzhao lose his mask.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will find a way to make up for it.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not a good idea to do this.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not long ago,

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I used the five-storied gang

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to eliminate the Qiyuan Sect's general.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The chief is dead.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to ask the other side to inform the high school

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to let him talk to the chief.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will be responsible for the future

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
of the Qiyuan Sect.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Boss, I have been responsible for the Qiyuan Sect.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You keep an eye on the Sea of Heaven and Love.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If Zhuyu is in a hurry,

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we must stop him.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll count on you.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't ever worry about it.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After your injury,

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you shouldn't have to play hide and seek with him.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Skills aren't enough.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tell him

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that he should go home soon.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
OK.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
door-to-door sincere

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I am sorry.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Master.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What's wrong, Zhang?

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
please feeli

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Be careful.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,440
Boss is worried about you.

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
I think it's right.

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,880
Lin Ye.

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,400
Why is Zhuyu called Lin Ye again?

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,120
Master Lin approximation.

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
Auspicious time.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,760
Qi.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,360
You are here.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Zhuyu.

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,640
There are many spells in fish clan.

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,280
Really?

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
You're my daughter.

85
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
As long as you want to learn,

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,960
I'll be willing to accept it.

87
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,560
Really?

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,920
Can you teach me

89
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
the way to break the spell of the protection?

90
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
I lost a lot of memories

91
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
because of me this week.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
I feel very guilty.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
The protection spell?

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,320
Is it because the protection spell

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,440
is a secret skill of the Yuzong clan?

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
You don't want to teach me?

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,320
Of course not.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
As long as you want to,

99
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,880
I can do anything for you.

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,360
Then I...

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
It's getting late.

102
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,960
You should go back and rest.

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
Let's talk about the spell

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
another day, okay?

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
What?

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,920
Are you afraid that I can't think of a way to kill myself?

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,960
There's wine in the morning, and you'll be drunk.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,720
You'll be worried tomorrow.

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Jinzhao,

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,320
have a drink.

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,720
Here.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,000
Come on.

113
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,560
Qi really likes water.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,200
I said he's like a fish,

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,600
but I didn't expect

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
that he was really more effective than me.

117
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Give it to me.

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,240
I just want to know

119
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,560
how much he loves water.

120
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
Can we count it together?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
To be honest with you,

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
I was right.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
So he is Kun.

124
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,960
He has different thoughts from ordinary people.

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,280
He has a long hair.

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,280
Now,

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
it's all my fault.

128
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
So what if he is Kun?

129
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,240
So what if he is a human?

130
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,800
Here.

131
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Let's drink to find our own identity.

132
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
Jinzhao, are you okay?

133
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,720
What's wrong with me?

134
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
In fact, I'm not happy

135
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,760
to find my own identity.

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,440
People

137
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
are interesting sometimes.

138
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,000
You can use four words now.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,320
Smiling and laughing.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm fine.

141
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm not smiling and laughing.

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
I'm smiling everywhere.

143
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,600
See if you can smile bigger.

144
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Don't worry.

145
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm not him.

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,280
Let me treat the soup for you.

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
We knew

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,560
Xiaoyue is the Young Master of the Mermaid Army.

149
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,960
You are now

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,080
a lousy student in a writer.

151
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
and spend three years with Qi?

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Is it me?

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,760
Is it really Yue Jinzhao?

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,840
Do you want to be with Qi

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
and protect his thoughts?

156
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
Is it Yue Jinzhao's inner thoughts?

157
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,440
Does Qi's dependence and importance

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,760
really come from Yue Jinzhao?

159
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Yue Jinzhao is not Yue Jinzhao's person.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
Xiao Jinzhao,

161
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,160
in my opinion,

162
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,200
your problems

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
are just a matter of time.

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
There is no past,

166
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
no memory.

167
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,680
The only thing that can be confirmed in these three years

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
is that I am Yue Jinzhao's person.

169
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,760
I can't even confirm this.

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
I have thought about it.

171
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,000
You have been looking for your identity.

172
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,360
Anyway,

173
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
you have found your place now.

174
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes.

175
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,480
You are right.

176
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,720
Qi finally found Wen Qing.

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,040
I should be happy for her.

178
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,920
Jinzhao.

179
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,680
Jinzhao.

180
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,240
And you.

181
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,800
Since you have someone you like,

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,560
you should let the other person know your feelings.

183
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
I...

184
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,440
I will try.

185
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,640
I will try.

186
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,760
Qingkong.

187
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,080
My grudge has actually released again.

188
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
Now I am lazier.

189
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,600
I'm fine.

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,960
I just need to endure this moment.

191
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
Zhao Yan.

192
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,160
What's the reason

193
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
why Luo's Gemstone was lost?

194
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Can you stop asking?

195
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
I don't want to lie to you.

196
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,560
Forget it.

197
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
If you don't want to say it,

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,440
then don't.

199
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,720
I'm fine.

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Xian Qing.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,320
Don't worry about me.

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,800
It's normal for me.

203
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,120
But even if you don't care about yourself,

204
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,200
the people around you

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
and the people who love you

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
don't care about them.

207
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
I won't let them know.

208
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
But I know

209
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,360
you care about them.

210
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Xian Qing, take it.

211
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
The next time.

212
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,320
It's no fun to me.

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
All right.

214
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
Every time when you're battered,

215
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
you should at least

216
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,920
try your best

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:17,780
to be happy and

218
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,380
I think we should do it next time.

219
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,340
Since you have a crush on someone,

220
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,220
you should let him know your feelings.

221
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,980
Miss Shou Xuan.

222
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Why are you here again?

223
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,020
Why do you keep following me?

224
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
I...

225
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I...

226
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Well...

227
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
I...

228
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,780
I...

229
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
I...

230
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
You like me?

231
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Well...

232
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,780
I just came from there...

233
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
I just came from there...

234
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
I...

235
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
I just came to see you...

236
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,780
We are heroes and heroes.

237
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,780
You are a coward who can't even beat me.

238
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Well...

239
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,780
I'm much better than before.

240
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Okay.

241
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Let's have a game.

242
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
If you win, I'll let you like me.

243
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,780
But if you lose,

244
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,780
you'll go as far as you can.

245
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Well...

246
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Do you want to fight?

247
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,780
Yes.

248
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
Zhao Yan.

249
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Do you really not know?

250
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Or you pretend not to know?

251
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Do you know what you are talking about?

252
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780
I know.

253
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
You said we were friends.

254
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
But I don't just want to be friends.

255
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
I don't just want to be your friend.

256
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
The hairpin I gave you that day

257
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
is my heart.

258
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,780
Zhao Yan is also interested in me.

259
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,780
But why does he keep running away?

260
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,780
I, Lu Zhao Yan, am a broken-hearted person.

261
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
I don't care if you are my Zhao Yan.

262
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
I just ask you.

263
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,780
Are you willing to be with me?

264
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,780
I don't know what to do.

265
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,780
The heart is full of the shadow.

266
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
Lu Xiao is still sleeping.

267
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Lu Jin.

268
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
Wu Feng.

269
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,780
Have a good rest.

270
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
With the youth,

271
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
the regret is determined.

272
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,780
I am the star.

273
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Zhao Yan.

274
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
I will wait for you.

275
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
I will wait for you.

276
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,780
I will wait for you.

277
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
You lost.

278
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,780
I am not powerful enough now.

279
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
But I will become more powerful.

280
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,780
One day, I will become a hero.

281
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,780
A hero.

282
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
So...

283
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
So...

284
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
So now...

285
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
You are interesting.

286
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Miss Shou Xuan.

287
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,780
What do you like?

288
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
The sea of love and the emperor.

289
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Are they together?

290
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,780
The emperor is the sea of love.

291
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,780
The sea of love is the emperor.

292
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
Do you have anything else you like?

293
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
And the little fish.

294
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,780
I like fish too.

295
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Really.

296
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
It's delicious.

297
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,780
Get out.

298
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
No.

299
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Miss Shou Xuan.

300
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
I didn't mean that.

301
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
I am sorry.

302
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Miss Shou Xuan.

303
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
I...

304
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
I messed it up again.

305
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
Zhao Yan.

306
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,780
You must take care of yourself.

307
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Wan Ming.

308
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
You too.

309
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,780
The sea of love and the emperor.

310
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,780
The young king of the fish tribe

311
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
and the fallen soul.

312
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Maybe they are the lost souls.

313
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Cao Feng.

314
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Things are getting interesting.

315
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
You like to watch good shows.

316
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
I can't leave the house without the family.

317
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
How can I leave the way of watching the show?

318
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Since Yue Qi is Kun.

319
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780
So Kun.

320
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,780
Now I can understand

321
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,780
why the hot sea ring is moving.

322
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,780
Why?

323
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,780
The nine power ring is from the divine.

324
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,780
The nine power and spirit will change.

325
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,780
The hot sea ring is from the dragon's feet.

326
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
The five-spirit ring

327
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
is from Kun's spirit.

328
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,780
So Yue Qi can make the hot sea ring move.

329
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
That's not strange.

330
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
I got it.

331
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
It seems that Zhou Yan is really happy

332
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,780
outside.

333
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
That's right.

334
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
It's there.

335
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,480
Though thecards were hidden by the face of woman,

336
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,940
getting here could be the most beatiful thing.

337
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:59,200
A life full of

338
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,040
I'll go with you.

339
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,120
Zhu Yu, according to what you said yesterday,

340
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,400
shouldn't you teach me

341
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,440
how to break the spell of protection?

342
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
No, no.

343
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,520
When I mentioned the spell of protection yesterday,

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,120
Zhu Yu didn't answer me.

345
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,000
How should I ask him?

346
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
Why is Qingzhou here?

347
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
Qi has been wandering with me for three years.

348
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
He has suffered a lot.

349
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,720
He should go back to his own world.

350
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,760
But you can't make a decision for him.

351
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,720
Actually, I wanted to take Qi away.

352
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,800
But he finally found his identity.

353
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,080
People here

354
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,120
will respect him and care for him.

355
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
I can't take away everything

356
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,680
that belongs to him because of my selfishness.

357
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,200
But he is willing to go with you.

358
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,560
You are the most important person to him.

359
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,920
I taught him everything that Qi knew.

360
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,320
The reason he chose me

361
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,720
is because he only has me in these three years.

362
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
It's not like that.

363
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,280
You insisted on leaving

364
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,040
because of the spell of protection.

365
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,400
Just wait.

366
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,840
On the� Е

367
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
豈neck有功名書

368
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
now.

369
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,120
God of Deception.

370
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,920
Please.

371
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Qi!

372
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Qi!

373
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Qi!

374
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Qi!

375
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Qi!

376
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:18,780
I don't want this

377
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Qi!

378
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
Qi...

379
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Qi...

380
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,780
Qi...

381
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,300
Qi!

382
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
Qi

383
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,980
But I'm afraid that I can't see you again

384
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,620
I'm afraid that the sky is gray

385
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,660
I'm afraid that we can't say goodbye

386
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,220
I'm afraid that we can only think of each other in our memories

387
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,980
I'm afraid that we can't meet again

388
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,540
I'm afraid that we'll be separated

389
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:24,380
Maybe I really don't need it

390
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,140
S-S agreements,

391
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,020
I must help my mom!

392
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,140
S-It's late.

393
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,220
S- rubbish!

394
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,300
S-Drown all your thoughts.

395
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,380
S-Stop crying, S Trad Unreal.

396
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,060
Jinqi,

397
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,940
do you really live here?

398
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,540
I know you miss your mother.

399
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,540
So, no matter how I accompany you,

400
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,540
I can't replace your love with Zhu Yu's.

401
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,540
But I don't want to be separated from you.

402
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,540
You may not get used to it at first.

403
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,540
But you will get used to it.

404
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
How can I get used to it?

405
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
You will.

406
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Just like the jade pendant you always wear,

407
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
you will pull it down.

408
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
Jinzhao, wait for me here.

409
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,540
I will go and get the jade pendant back.

410
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Wait for me.

411
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Although Miss Yue is naive, she is not stupid.

412
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
One day she will understand that

413
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,540
in her world,

414
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
you are not the only one.

415
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
Protecting too much is not always good.

416
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,540
Goodbye.

417
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
Please.

418
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Where am I?

419
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,540
I finally found it.

420
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Yue Jinzhao left.

421
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,540
He left when the cloud came.

422
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
This is what he left.

423
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,540
I wrote some things that Qi likes in it.

424
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,540
It's also some of the things I've been taking care of him for the past three years.

425
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
Don't worry.

426
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,540
I will take care of him like you do.

427
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Qi is very greedy, but rarely eats.

428
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,540
His favorite food is egg noodles and the jade pendant.

429
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,540
He likes to listen to the play and read the script.

430
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
He especially likes to listen to the storyteller's story.

431
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Every time he meets someone who is a storyteller,

432
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
he can't stop talking.

433
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
I'm sorry.

434
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm sorry.

435
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
I'm sorry.

436
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Damn you!

437
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
You are a thunder habr!

438
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Please give her the egg noodles.

439
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I just tried to stop her.

440
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
You are so silly!

441
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
At least the egg noodles,

442
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
learn a lesson!

443
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Why don't you cook an egg bowl for her?

444
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:43,160
I just saw the inspiration in the

445
00:30:44,540 --> 00:31:12,020
Xiaofengum Commentary

446
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
They like you.

447
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,900
What they need is a free life.

448
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,380
Jin Sheng.

449
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,060
I must find a way to help you get rid of the guards.

450
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:53,900
You are willing to return the favor this time.

451
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,140
Xiaoyue is not here.

452
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,220
What are you going to do next?

453
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,020
Now that Qi has found the body,

454
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,700
it's my turn.

455
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,540
I have to find Bian Luo Huan.

456
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,940
I have to ask about my identity

457
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,820
and get rid of Qi Yuan tribe.

458
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,140
In case they...

459
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,340
There is a leaf.

460
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,260
Jin Sheng.

461
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,460
What's wrong?

462
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:52,980
Nothing.

463
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,540
I just suddenly thought

464
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,540
that since we met Gao Xiaoyang's monster

465
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,220
in the Yi Ma River,

466
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,620
will Qi Yuan tribe's stronghold

467
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,780
be around there?

468
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,700
It makes sense.

469
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,700
If we want to destroy Qi Yuan tribe,

470
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm afraid we have to cooperate with the Zhenwu Alliance.

471
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,020
But we have already broken up with them.

472
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,460
I can stay.

473
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,340
Xianqing.

474
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,540
Are you still concerned about

475
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,300
the previous Chief Zuo?

476
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,140
For me,

477
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,980
it's just a matter of time.

478
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,220
I've lived for thousands of years.

479
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,780
But the Chief Zuo is just over a hundred years old.

480
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,860
How can I be so concerned

481
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,380
about a junior like me?

482
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,260
And I've been used to everything for thousands of years.

483
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,260
I've walked a lot with you.

484
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,340
I've walked a lot.

485
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,820
I'm tired.

486
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,900
Then go back to Mount Yuqing to recuperate.

487
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,140
Will you still come back

488
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,180
to meet us?

489
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,100
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,260
Zhao Yan followed me secretly.

491
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,340
He has something to tell me.

492
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,420
I know.

493
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,580
You left to help everyone

494
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,460
cooperate with the Zhenwu Alliance.

495
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,420
Zhao Yan understands me.

496
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:40,900
But

497
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,820
I thought you were here to tell me the answer.

498
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,820
Forget it.

499
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,500
I have to go.

500
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,340
I'll go first.

501
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,700
I want to...

502
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,060
What?

503
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,100
I want to...

504
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,140
I want to meet you again.

505
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,260
I want to be with you.

506
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,940
Meet again.

507
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,860
The training program is going줄 twelve灣

508
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,700
Dr blinking

509
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,660
meet again

510
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,700
meet again

511
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:04,160
See you in

512
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,540
Fine.

513
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,500
Go ahead.

514
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,020
Your Majesty.

515
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,340
How's Shao Jing?

516
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,900
She's fine now.

517
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,940
But just now,

518
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,180
I saw her crying.

519
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,940
Crying?

520
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,580
Young Master is the King's descendant.

521
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,620
How could Kun cry?

522
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,340
Yes.

523
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,300
How could Kun cry?

524
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,820
I'm still Kun.

525
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,700
But my daughter

526
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,580
is becoming more and more like a human.

527
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,140
Young Master must have been traveling in the mortal world for too long

528
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,100
and has been deformed by humans.

529
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,300
We can't let this continue.

530
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:46,980
Your Majesty,

531
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,580
why don't we take this opportunity

532
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,700
to keep Young Master in the Sea of Heavenly Love

533
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
and stay by your side?

534
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,500
Never!

535
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,140
Your Majesty,

536
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,620
if we let Young Master stay in the Sea of Heavenly Love for too long,

537
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,020
I'm afraid it will ruin

538
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,380
our agreement with the Taoism Seeker.

539
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,580
The Taoism Seeker's agreement.

540
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,220
At worst, we'll break up with the Taoism Seeker.

541
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,700
It's not the time yet.

542
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,860
Your Majesty,

543
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,700
there's one more thing.

544
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,580
The Taoism Seeker is now

545
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,780
harvesting dragon crystal.

546
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,700
Dragon crystal can be used as a mechanism for energy.

547
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
I'm afraid it will be used

548
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,140
to deal with our tribe in the future.

549
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
Don't be afraid.

550
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,820
Now,

551
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,780
the most important thing

552
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,500
is to find the hot sea.

553
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,420
Yes.

554
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,620
With the power of the hot sea,

555
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,180
His Majesty

556
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,700
can quickly cure our Yuzo.

557
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,180
Your Majesty,

558
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,100
I'm sorry.

559
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,940
I'm sorry.

560
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,820
I'm sorry.

561
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
I'm sorry.

562
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
I'm sorry.

563
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
I'm sorry.

564
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
I'm sorry.

565
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,820
I'm sorry.

566
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,820
I'm sorry.

567
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,820
I'm sorry.

569
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,820
I'm sorry.
