1
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:25,010


2
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,167
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,723
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:39,931
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:44,799
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,947
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:54,491
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,799
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,939
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:01,919
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:06,495
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:11,363
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:15,451
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:21,759
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,187
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:30,395
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:38,795
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:56,405
   

19
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:59,960
   

20
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:05,387
Young Hero Yue and Miss Yue were chosen by the Hengdao Sect to kill Zhu Yu.

21
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:07,286
Yes.

22
00:02:07,286 --> 00:02:10,626
I've never appreciated the Hengdao Sect's approach.

23
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:13,066
But Qi made her choice.

24
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,666
I'm going to stand by her.

25
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:21,347
I truly admire your lofty spirit.

26
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,867
Alliance Leader Zuo, I bet you know that

27
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:28,806
Zhu Yu has been consuming Qiyuan Orbs as if she's out of control.

28
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:32,926
The Righteous Martial Alliance alone is no match for her.

29
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:37,066
You only stand a chance if you join hands with us.

30
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,666
Commander Yue, is that a threat?

31
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,986
I'm just stating the facts.

32
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,647
What a pity that our reputation...

33
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:51,387
should end up disdained because of me.

34
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,747
Leader, it matters more to save lives.

35
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:57,486
Not many people know that the Hengdao Sect controls the Qiyuan Sect.

36
00:02:57,486 --> 00:03:00,127
All you have to do is keep it a secret.

37
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:04,226
We may fool others.

38
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,787
But how do we fool ourselves?

39
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,586
You can't.

40
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:12,247
But it's all about having a clear conscience.

41
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:15,847
Alliance Leader, death shall be my redemption.

42
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,507
I'll die for the alliance.

43
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:24,506
To protect our reputation, I can drop out of the alliance to assist them.

44
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:29,747
All right.

45
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,387
You have backbone.

46
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,546
I'll make you the vanguard.

47
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:35,906
Thank you, Alliance Leader.

48
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:37,526
Young Hero Yue.

49
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:44,186
Please inform Ying Xuwei that I agree...

50
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,347
to work with the Hengdao Sect.

51
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,166
Thank you, Alliance Leader Zuo.

52
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,846
Alliance Leader.

53
00:03:56,186 --> 00:04:00,660
This is purely my decision.

54
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,526
You're only pressured by me to carry out the task.

55
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,067
Later,

56
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:12,646
I'll make it clear to the people.

57
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:16,006
 We pledge loyalty to you, Alliance Leader. 

58
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:23,186
Alliance Leader Zuo.

59
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:27,226
Once Rehai reaches Buried Wind Plains, Zhu Yu will come.

60
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:31,807
Then you will handle the Yu Clan on Earth.

61
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:35,906
Yujie Hub will handle the remnant on the Sea of Clear Skies.

62
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:37,867
All right.

63
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:44,027
From now on, I will mobilize all our disciples against Zhu Yu.

64
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:58,026
Zuo Guanren agreed to work with us?

65
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:02,746
Yue Jinzhao made a deal with him.

66
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,626
Eldest Brother,

67
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,686
do you regret it?

68
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:12,386
I know I'm beyond redemption.

69
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:15,660
All I can do is to save the Six Realms.

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,780
Excuse me, Commanders.

71
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:26,667
Something is bothering me.

72
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:30,986
When did Maiming contact you?

73
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,166
Does it matter?

74
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:38,986
It matters to me.

75
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,466
Please kindly tell me.

76
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:46,067
Back in the Luori Village,

77
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:50,127
when you were asking Qi about Rehai,

78
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,408
my people overheard you.

79
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,987
Then, Eldest Brother visited the Luo family...

80
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:59,247
and spoke with Luo Maiming.

81
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,546
- Luo Maiming was a smart guy. 
  - I hope... 

82
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:05,707
- He assessed the situation and made a deal with us. 
  - we can work well together. 

83
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,761
 This is... the key ring of Rehai? 

84
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:20,466
 This key ring of Rehai is an important item against Zhu Yu. 

85
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:26,226
 Next time we meet, we'll discuss how to deal with Zhu Yu. 

86
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:29,787
 I've agreed to side with you against Zhu Yu. 

87
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:36,391
 In exchange, shouldn't you show me some sincerity, Commander Ying? 

88
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
 I wonder if the way to remove the binding shows enough sincerity. 

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,040
 I wonder if the way to remove the binding shows enough sincerity. 

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
We teamed up against Zhu Yu.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,979
He did it to learn how to remove the Bloodbinding spell.

92
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,799
Thank you.

93
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,580
No problem.

94
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,799
I always thought that Maiming had committed heinous crimes.

95
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,720
I dare not even...

96
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,359
think about him these days.

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,480
But now, I know that he's done his part to help take down Zhu Yu,

98
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:38,380
I... don't know what to think.

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,739
If you're confused,

100
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,220
just follow your heart.

101
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,600
Think about your initial aspiration.

102
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,599
It may offer you the courage to face it.

103
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,180
My initial aspiration?

104
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,419
Eldest Brother, have some tea.

105
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,947
What's wrong?

106
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:30,307
I talked too much?

107
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,667
I know you're soft.

108
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:41,466
If Zuo Guanren acts according to the plan,

109
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:44,167
we have a greater chance.

110
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,107
There's only one final step.

111
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:56,326
With Qi and Yue Jinzhao excluded, four people can approach the Yu Clan.

112
00:08:57,205 --> 00:09:00,966
If we keep our promise to Luo Maiming,

113
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,947
Luo Zhaoyan and Xian Qing are excluded.

114
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:06,907
As for the remaining two...

115
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:15,626
Ju Shifang and Shuo Xuan seem to have something going on.

116
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:21,486
If anything goes wrong, we will do it ourselves.

117
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:25,590
We must send the removal method of the Bloodbinding to Mist Soul

118
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,580
no matter what.

119
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:30,667
For some people,

120
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:35,327
the safety of one person matters more than anything.

121
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:38,466
Before, I didn't believe it.

122
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:46,227
Eldest Brother,

123
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,126
I've been thinking.

124
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,827
Once the war is over,

125
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:57,747
let's take Xiaoyuan to travel to the Mortal Realm.

126
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:05,267
All right.

127
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:53,667
Xian Qing.

128
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,520
Are you practicing for the battle tomorrow?

129
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,154
Yes. Shall we exchange a few moves?

130
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,747
All right.

131
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:21,878
♫  I've never dreamed of what the world would look like  ♫

00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,586
Want a break?

157
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,427
All right.

158
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:45,207
It seems that your mindset changed just now.

159
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,607
You told me to keep my initial aspiration.

160
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,566
I've been thinking...

161
00:13:56,527 --> 00:14:00,286
and I finally figured it out during our practice.

162
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,886
It's my aspiration and obligation to shoulder my duty

163
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,386
and protect the people I care about.

164
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,167
You have a great ambition.

165
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,146
I will stand by you.

166
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,606
I can die for anyone,

167
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:29,447
but I only live for one person.

168
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:47,767
Commander Ge, I've learned a lot about gadgets from you these days.

169
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:48,747
Thanks.

170
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:50,206
No problem.

171
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,787
Oh, right.

172
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,586
Thanks to your instructions,

173
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:58,007
I've managed to improve it.

174
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,360
 Shifang! 

175
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,920
Coming.

176
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,647
Commander Ge, Jinzhao is calling me.

177
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,547
See you.

178
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,867
Go ahead.

179
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,166
Goodbye...

180
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:20,207
and farewell.

181
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,090
   

182
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,630
   

183
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:00,627
Alliance Leader Zuo.

184
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,447
How did it go?

185
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:08,466
Chen Qianjun and our people were spotted by the demons at Buried Wind Plains

186
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,887
and suffered a huge loss.

187
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:15,127
The battle hasn't started and we are already suffering huge losses?

188
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:18,867
Alliance Leader Zuo, please do me a favor.

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,326
The gadgets of Yujie Hub can attack the physical form of Kun.

190
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:26,007
But it's a mythical beast.

191
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:29,567
The attack has to land on the weakest spot to work.

192
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:31,946
Commander Ying has observed Zhu Yu for years

193
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:36,787
and came up with three possible weak spots. However, they aren't certain.

194
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:41,507
The stored energy allows the Yujie Hub to launch three attacks.

195
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:45,606
The Hengdao Sect needs the Dragon Crystals in Wuyan Village.

196
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:49,867
The more crystals we dig out, the more likely we can win.

197
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,627
I thought the Hengdao Sect could see the future

198
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:54,787
and had an awe-inspiring power.

199
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:57,567
In the end, they need us to dig rocks for them.

200
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,280
Lingyun.

201
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,966
 See the future? 

202
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,447
We're not doing this for the Hengdao Sect or the Yujie Hub.

203
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,066
It's for the people in this world.

204
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,266
That's right.

205
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:12,806
To fight for the people is to fight for ourselves.

206
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,287
Miss Yue, you're truly wise.

207
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,227
Lingyun, make the arrangements.

208
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,363
Understood.

209
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:31,827
Where is Shifang?

210
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:35,287
He went to check on the gadgets at the Mechanic Skill Hall.

211
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,347
It's his birthday.

212
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,267
Never mind.

213
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,566
Get to business.

214
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,107
Come in.

215
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:04,847
Senior Xian Qing?

216
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,707
   

217
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:45,247
 I've entrusted the way to undermine Zhu Yu to someone trustworthy. 

218
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:51,227
 Come at 13:15 to the river shore of Jing'an if you're interested. 

219
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,035
   

220
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,410
   

221
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,427
Is anyone here?

222
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:47,827
Is anyone here?

223
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,466
Cang Feng?

224
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,727
You delivered the letter?

225
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:04,347
Then Miss Ming...

226
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:07,106
I asked her to meet me tomorrow.

227
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:10,267
    
 The note said

228
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,627
if I was ready to sacrifice myself,

229
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:15,307
you could help us undermine Kun's power.

230
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,175
It's from my master.

231
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,487
 The bottle contains Yue Qi's blood. 

232
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:28,326
 Yue Qi and Zhu Yu are bonded by blood. 

233
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:32,000
 Her blood is the key to removing the Bloodbinding. 

234
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,481
 Smudge the blood on Shuo Xuan and injure her 

235
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:40,487
 so that she enters the Core of the Demon Realm for treatment. 

236
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:43,260
 Yue Qi's blood and the power of Rehai 

237
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,600
 will remove the Bloodbinding between Zhu Yu and Mist Soul. 

238
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:54,280
 Zhu Yu's Vitality Energy will decrease rapidly 

239
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,546
 and that's your best chance to kill her. 

240
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:00,340
M-Miss Shuo Xuan?

241
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,740
Does it have to be her?

242
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,227
Yes.

243
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:11,047
Shuo...

244
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,570
Shuo...

245
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:16,352
You're hesitating.

246
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:19,934
If you're scared, forget it.

247
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,166
I didn't know it was Shifang's birthday.

248
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,006
He never mentioned it.

249
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,766
After today, Young Shifang will be one year older.

250
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,586
Alliance Leader Zuo and Commander Ying were discussing the battle earlier.

251
00:22:42,586 --> 00:22:45,767
It sounded like Alliance Leader Zuo wanted to celebrate Shifang's birthday.

252
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,867
But he may not have time for it.

253
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,546
When we toured around Jing'an at night, I think he mentioned that

254
00:22:55,546 --> 00:23:00,107
he would love to celebrate his birthday just like Ming Xiu did.

255
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,926
What do you think?

256
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,387
Jing'an has become desolate.

257
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,907
A night tour may only upset him.

258
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:13,866
Any other ideas?

259
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,206
How about this? Let's get some things and decorate this place before he comes back.

260
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,827
All right. And we should make a birthday bowl of noodles with an egg.

261
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,087
Miss Shuo Xuan.

262
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,387
I can do it.

263
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,066
Give it to me.

264
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:03,866
It contains Young Yue's blood?

265
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:05,506
Yes.

266
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:10,786
Jinzhao and Xian Qing told us to be careful.

267
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:14,027
The Hengdao Sect may send the removal method

268
00:24:14,027 --> 00:24:17,146
to Mist Soul regardless of our safety.

269
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:22,726
But I guess they didn't know that it would be you.

270
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:27,987
Jinzhao and Young Yue are the keys to taking down Zhu Yu.

271
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:30,946
And Luo Maiming cares about Zhaoyan.

272
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:36,046
So... only Xian Qing, Miss Ming, and I got the letter. Right?

273
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:37,726
Not the wolf demon.

274
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:40,627
Then...

275
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:44,986
So if I succeed, Miss Ming won't have to take the risk. Right?

276
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,779
I can't guarantee that.

277
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:27,099
   

278
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,275
   

279
00:25:56,987 --> 00:26:02,166
I just tried my new... gadget.

280
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,666
   

281
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,587
Nobody's here?

282
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,100
That's better.

283
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:17,967
That's better.

284
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:24,506
That's better.

285
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:28,467
That's better.

286
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,646
Shifang.

287
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:38,247
A'Yang.

288
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,967
In trouble again?

289
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:44,486
N-No.

290
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,626
Our leader wants to see you.

291
00:27:01,227 --> 00:27:03,786
What's wrong? Come on in.

292
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,930
   

293
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:40,666
Shifang.

294
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:43,147
Go ahead.

295
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:57,946
It's your 20th birthday.

296
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:01,387
I'm supposed to hold a ceremony for you.

297
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:05,066
But it's a critical time with the battle pending.

298
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:09,227
So I downsized it.

299
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:15,767
From now on, you'll be a real adult.

300
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:23,107
I wish you longevity and happiness.

301
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,700
Get up.

302
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,907
You've grown up.

303
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:02,387
 - Shifang!  
 - Shifang.

304
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,946
Happy birthday.

305
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:06,987
Shifang, happy birthday.

306
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:08,607
Alliance Leader Zuo.

307
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,227
I still have many things to do.

308
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,927
Enjoy the night.

309
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,286
All right.

310
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:33,267
Shifang, happy birthday.

311
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:35,267
Let's drink tomorrow.

312
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:38,107
Come on.

313
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:40,047
Come on.

314
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,047
Sit.

315
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:45,867
Shifang, happy birthday.

316
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,567
Look.

317
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,706
Sister Ming Xiu made the noodles for you.

318
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,806
Dig in.

319
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,566
Sister Ming Xiu.

320
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:06,447
It's your birthday.

321
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,367
Happy birthday.

322
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:14,494
 So if I succeed, Miss Ming won't have to take the risk. Right? 

323
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,387
Shifang, happy birthday.

324
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:23,707
Rest assured, we'll be celebrating all your birthdays with you

325
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:26,273
every year from now on.

326
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,066
Yeah.

327
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:29,867
The birthday boy has to make a wish.

328
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,666
Come on. Make a wish.

329
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,747
- Make a wish. 
 - Hurry.

330
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:11,750
 My wish is to become a great gadget mechanist like my mother... 

331
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,900
 and... 

332
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,970
 and to gather for birthdays like we're doing right now. 

333
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,446
What's wrong? Make a wish.

334
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:05,107
Shifang, what's wrong?

335
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:06,986
What's wrong?

336
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,107
Nothing.

337
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:18,646
I...

338
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:25,727
I haven't celebrated my birthday with such a big crowd for many years.

339
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:29,747
Brother Wen Yang used to keep me company.

340
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,147
And our alliance leader, sometimes.

341
00:32:32,147 --> 00:32:34,486
But they've been very busy.

342
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:38,646
I celebrated my birthday alone most of those years.

343
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:45,306
But it's all right now.

344
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:47,247
I have you all.

345
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:51,667
It's the first time I'm celebrating my birthday with so many friends.

346
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:56,627
I think my life is worth it.

347
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:57,807
Yeah.

348
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:00,046
What are you talking about, Shifang?

349
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,546
We'll celebrate your birthday

350
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:05,606
with you every year from now on.

351
00:33:07,627 --> 00:33:09,647
Be good.

352
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,227
Dig in. Try it.

353
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:18,907
Okay.

354
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:20,987
Then...

355
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:23,726
Then... it's a deal.

356
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:25,766
You'll celebrate...

357
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:29,287
my birthday every year.

358
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:32,427
This day every year.

359
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,727
I won't change at all.

360
00:33:37,727 --> 00:33:39,987
No problem.

361
00:33:39,987 --> 00:33:44,727
Young Shifang, are you saying you want a demon spell to stay young forever?

362
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:49,426
It's Shifang's birthday.

363
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,427
We need alcohol.

364
00:33:52,747 --> 00:33:54,426
No one is returning home sober.

365
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:56,067
All right.

366
00:34:05,267 --> 00:34:06,786
Come on.

367
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:34,706
 - Shifang. 
 - Shifang. 

368
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:38,866
 - Happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday. 

369
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:17,047
I must send the removal method to Mist Soul inside Kun.

370
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:22,847
That's the only way for Jinzhao and the others to stop the madness of Zhu Yu.

371
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,826
I can do this.

372
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:28,600
I have to. I have to.

373
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:34,807
Senior Gu died for me at the headquarters of the Qiyuan Sect.

374
00:35:34,807 --> 00:35:38,626
It's my turn to protect everyone.

375
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,286
It's my turn to protect everyone.

376
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,326
Mother,

377
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:02,987
you'll be watching me from heaven.

378
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:04,886
Right?

379
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:16,707
I'm crying?

380
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,827
So embarrassing.

381
00:36:29,107 --> 00:36:30,906
Dou Bao.

382
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,561
Let's go.

383
00:36:56,907 --> 00:36:58,527
Enemy approaching.

384
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:00,306
Wait.

385
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:03,586
Isn't he one of the humans who has been to the Sea of Clear Skies with our young lord?

386
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:05,400
It's weird.

387
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,281
Why did he come here alone?

388
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:10,327
General said that the young lord had betrayed us.

389
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,287
Her friends are our enemies.

390
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:15,187
- Get him. Go. 
 - Go.

391
00:37:15,187 --> 00:37:16,927
Stop!

392
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:21,007
- Get him. 
 - Understood.

393
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:51,580
Ju Shifang, you shouldn't be here.

394
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,347
We're enemies, not friends.

395
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:57,266
I won't show mercy on the battlefield.

396
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:58,480
I want to...

397
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,986
I want to see Miss Shuo Xuan.

398
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:03,546
You think you can just ask to see our lord?

399
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:05,640
Who do you think you are?

400
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,332
Take him away.

401
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,287
Let go of him.

402
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:27,940


403
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:37,182
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

404
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:40,643
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

405
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:46,554
♫  Would it be the joy or penetrating sorrow from the years?  ♫

406
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:51,535
♫  What do I hear? The laughter running through the Milky Way  ♫

407
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:55,242
♫  What do I hear? The laughter running through the Milky Way  ♫

408
00:38:55,242 --> 00:39:00,827
♫  My heart remembers who you are  ♫

409
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:05,843
♫  Grasping this short happiness over and over again  ♫

410
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,973
♫  Unable to ask you to stay with me  ♫

411
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:12,463
♫  The stories force me to sit with my regrets, to try and reconcile  ♫

412
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:17,375
♫  Why do my emotions still have to pull at my memories?  ♫

413
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:23,312
♫  I search for you, I draw closer to you  ♫

414
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:26,995
♫  Like the tide chasing you  ♫

415
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:30,643
♫  I asked fate to steal the answer to the riddle  ♫

416
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:34,263
♫  If I use this in exchange, could you not leave?  ♫

417
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:37,911
♫  I had you, yet lost you  ♫

418
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:42,353
♫  Only to redefine our reunion  ♫

419
00:39:44,396 --> 00:39:47,955
♫  That is the puzzle our past life laid out for us  ♫

420
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:51,843
♫  Where are you, who stood by my side?  ♫

421
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:57,604
♫  Leave the sorrow that aches  ♫

422
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,812
♫  Passing through the sea of people alone, after you left  ♫

423
00:39:59,812 --> 00:40:01,235
♫  Arriving at the end of time  ♫

424
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,979
♫  That feeling of being at the end for a long time  ♫

425
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,827
♫  It's like the smile you left behind  ♫

426
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:06,459
♫  Lighting up my skies over and over again  ♫

427
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:09,585
♫  I open both hands and slowly become weightless  ♫

428
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:13,161
♫  Unable to hold on, I should let go  ♫

429
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,247
♫  Too afraid to ask, so I say I can bear it  ♫

430
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,809
♫  It's as if the story is complicated and you don't understand  ♫

431
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:23,415
♫  We constantly turn and look back because we can't let go  ♫

432
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,926
♫  I search for you, I draw closer to you  ♫

433
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:30,686
♫  Like the tide chasing you  ♫

434
00:40:30,686 --> 00:40:34,248
♫  I asked fate to steal the answer to the riddle  ♫

435
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:37,927
♫  If I use this in exchange, could you not leave?  ♫

436
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,633
♫  I had you, yet lost you  ♫

437
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:47,923
♫  Only to redefine our reunion again  ♫

438
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:51,629
♫  That is the puzzle our past life laid out for us (the puzzle)  ♫

439
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:56,891
♫  Where are you, who stood by my side?  ♫

440
00:40:56,891 --> 00:41:00,457
♫  There are things I want to say, but my memories are fuzzy  ♫

441
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:04,117
♫  As if I'm broken, almost drowned by the loneliness  ♫

442
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:11,319
♫  Asking you, can I see you again?  ♫

443
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:14,675
♫  Wandering in the sea of people, who will stop when passing by?  ♫

444
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:18,277
♫  I know that look in your eyes, firm and gentle (firm and gentle)  ♫

445
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:26,317
♫  Look at me, only look at me  ♫

446
00:41:28,913 --> 00:41:32,507
♫  I meet you, I bid farewell to you  ♫

447
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:36,165
♫  Brushing past waving, without saying a word  ♫

448
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:39,775
♫  The longing hidden in my breath  ♫

449
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:43,377
♫  Gentle and tender as if it were you  ♫

450
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:47,007
♫  I miss you, I forgot you  ♫

451
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:52,959
♫  Trying to calm the confused emotions  ♫

452
00:41:54,391 --> 00:41:58,059
♫  Watching you walk towards me determinedly  ♫

453
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:03,859
♫  I hear you calling my name  ♫
