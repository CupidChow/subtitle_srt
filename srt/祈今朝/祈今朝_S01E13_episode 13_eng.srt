00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:25,050


2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,636
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,384
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,528
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,504
   

19
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,950
   

20
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:27,419
 Thank you, Miss Ming. Thanks to your magic lamp, we escaped. 

21
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,040
Jinzhao.

22
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,920
Why are there two of you?

23
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000
Qi.

24
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,360
Jinzhao, I don't feel good.

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,740
Okay, I'll take you to rest.

26
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,020
Jinzhao, let's find a place to settle down first.

27
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,100
Let's go.

28
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,219
Greetings, Lord Shengxuan.

29
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,499
What is it?

30
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:27,219
My Lord, today, at the Righteous Martial Alliance, I saw those ruffians again.

31
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:33,340
And that... monster who killed Zhenyao fish with a single blow.

32
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,460
Lord Shengxuan.

33
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,420
The Righteous Martial Alliance is the number one sect in the world.

34
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,199
If that bunch of people cooperate with them, it would likely be detrimental to us.

35
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,040
If that bunch of people cooperate with them, it would likely be detrimental to us.

36
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,700
But I used a little trick.

37
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,180
I got someone to poison them with Huanxing Incense.

38
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,520
If the Righteous Martial Alliance knows there's a demon among those people,

39
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,400
their friendly relationship won't last long.

40
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,220
So it was you.

41
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,539
- Gao Xiao. 
 - Yes.

42
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,650
You've done a great job.

43
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,450
I'll naturally secure your succession as the sect leader.

44
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,299
Thank you, Lord Shengxuan.

45
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:23,039
I'll repay your great kindness even by risking my life.

46
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,759
I'll take my leave then.

47
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,750
 Gao Xiao. 

48
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,470
 I'll get back at you on behalf of Qi. 

49
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,030
Young Zhaoyan,

50
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,010
I've... brought you trouble this time.

51
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,370
How so?

52
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,340
Without you today, we wouldn't know Bian Luohuan's real identity.

53
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,480
Without you today, we wouldn't know Bian Luohuan's real identity.

54
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,720
Also, we don't care if you're a demon.

55
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,500
That's what everyone thinks?

56
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,008
Of course, although you're a wolf demon, you're kind-hearted towards me...

57
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,460
I mean, all of us. And you help us a lot.

58
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,150
You...

59
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,180
And what do you think?

60
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,919
To me, you are a very loyal buddy and friend.

61
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,560
Buddy?

62
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,759
Forget it, at least you don't despise me for being a demon.

63
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,859
I wanted to give this to you before.

64
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,800
Thank you, but this hairpin is something used by women.

65
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,144
You know?

66
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,619
Yes, just as you know I'm a demon.

67
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,180
Senior, I...

68
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,639
Zhaoyan, I...

69
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,220
Senior Xian Qing, I brought you...

70
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

71
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,420
I'll put it here.

72
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,080
You two, go ahead.

73
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,840
You saved me anyway.

74
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,780
A hairpin as a token of gratitude isn't too much. Right?

75
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,560
In that case, I accept it.

76
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,280
You mean he looks exactly the same?

77
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,979
It's just that he has a scar on his face.

78
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,779
This Shengxuan of the Qiyuan Sect looks so much like me.

79
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,280
Could it be that we're brothers?

80
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,220
Then, wouldn't our investigation into the Qiyuan Sect turn into a joke?

81
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
You're wrong. Although Physician Bian...

82
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,940
No, you're just you. You're different from everyone else.

83
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,399
Your eyes are brighter than his.

84
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,561
You're also warmer than him.

85
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,340
What's wrong?

86
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,480
Qi.

87
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,310
Do you know what the deal with these scales is?

88
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,939
Why did they grow out again?

89
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,430
Again?

90
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,080
They appeared after I consumed the Qiyuan Orb at Fujin Hall before.

91
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,659
But they disappeared quickly, so I didn't pay much attention.

92
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:37,240
So I wasn't wrong about what I saw by the Yinma River.

93
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,900
They appeared on me at that time, too?

94
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,879
Qi, don't you think these scales are quite pretty?

95
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,880
They're amazing.

96
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,159
So, don't worry.

97
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:04,700
You must remember not to show these scales to others or tell anyone about them.

98
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,980
Not even Zhaoyan? Isn't she our good friend?

99
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,499
We can't let our good friends worry.

100
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:14,840
We'll tell them after we find evidence. Okay?

101
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:29,740
   

102
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,860
Do you realize your mistake?

103
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,760
It was my fault that I let Yue Jinzhao knock off my mask,

104
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
but I don't regret it.

105
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,568
 Third Brother! 

106
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
Young Huan.

107
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,579
Brother, Young Huan did it to save Qi, so that's why...

108
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,979
If you had left immediately after rescuing her,

109
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:32,560
they wouldn't have seen your face.

110
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,059
According to the rules of our sect,

111
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,919
what punishment should one receive for deliberate violations?

112
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,760
They shall be punished with thunder.

113
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,419
- Third Brother! 
 - Xiaoyuan, don't go.

114
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:27,360
It'll just make things worse for him.

115
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,979
Before, Qingfei concealed your breach of oath in the Luori Village.

116
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:40,919
I turned a blind eye and let it pass

117
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,100
because it didn't affect our greater plan.

118
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,059
But this time, you exposed your face.

119
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,560
Our plan may very well be ruined because of it.

120
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,430
Eldest Brother,

121
00:12:55,932 --> 00:12:59,780
it was I who broke the vow. I admit all my faults.

122
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,680
You're all talk. In your heart, you don't believe it at all!

123
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,919
The one who's intertwined with Qi's fate now is Yue Jinzhao! Not you, Bian Luohuan!

124
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,539
Yue Jinzhao exists because of you.

125
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,650
For Qi,

126
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,120
you're the past. He's the future.

127
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
When will you understand?

128
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,259
I've always known,

129
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,200
but...

130
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,390
I don't like it.

131
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,979
- Third Brother! 
 - Xiaoyuan, don't go over.

132
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,979
Eldest Brother, please, just spare Young Huan!

133
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:13,519
It's not that I refuse to let this go.

134
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,680
It's because he won't let go himself.

135
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,279
Third Brother, I'm asking you again.

136
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,040
Do you recognize your mistake?

137
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,460
I made no mistake, so how can I recognize it?

138
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,300
Young Huan!

139
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,476
Fine.

140
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:39,608
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

141
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:42,120
♫  If love arises with the wind  ♫

142
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,980
♫  How do I calm it?  ♫

143
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,484
♫  I've done my best  ♫

144
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:52,296
♫  But our paths just won't cross  ♫

145
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:55,800
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

146
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,668
Third Brother!

147
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,140
Young Huan, are you okay?

148
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,860
Xiaoyuan, I'm fine.

149
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,619
You're lying. You were struck by thunder! How can you be fine?

150
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,960
- Sister Ming Xiu's tea smells nice. 
 - Brother Yue. Young Yue.

151
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,919
Be careful, it's hot.

152
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,220
Thanks, Sister Ming Xiu, you're so kind.

153
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,580
By the way, how is Senior Xian Qing?

154
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,900
Didn't you agree we'd be buddies? Why are you still calling me senior?

155
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,120
Okay, Xian Qing.

156
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,959
I'll call you Xian Qing from now on, too.

157
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:45,020
Little Yue, you must get revenge for me.

158
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,340
Of course. Jinzhao and I've already agreed.

159
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,521
This time, we must eliminate the Qiyuan Sect.

160
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,540
Everyone, about the fact that Bian Luohuan looks like me...

161
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,639
Jinzhao, you are you and he is he. We can tell the difference.

162
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,360
Thanks.

163
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,240
But you and Bian Luohuan look like twins.

164
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,779
We might not tell who's who by looks, but I...

165
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,120
But we know well that you and Bian Luohuan are fundamentally different.

166
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
Let's think about what we should do next.

167
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,599
Previously, at Fujin Hall,

168
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:30,419
the Qiyuan Sect said that Shengxuan wanted to capture us.

169
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,159
Later, at Fengyan Inn, they identified Bian Luohuan as Shengxuan.

170
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,780
I've always suspected Bian Luohuan is plotting against me and Qi.

171
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,800
But I don't know his exact purpose yet.

172
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,560
We'll continue to investigate the Qiyuan Sect and catch Bian Luohuan.

173
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,939
Right now, the only clue we have is the crystal.

174
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,340
And the crystal is in the mechanism box of the Qiyuan Sect.

175
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,499
Then it must be related to the sect.

176
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:59,619
He also appeared in Wuyan Village, where Qi and I woke up.

177
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,680
In addition, I bear a strong resemblance to Bian Luohuan.

178
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,120
Let's just go back to the village and ask Madam Shi.

179
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,699
Little Yue has really grown up.

180
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,265
How is Third Brother?

181
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,324
He has taken his medicine and gone to sleep.

182
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,839
Actually, it hasn't been easy for him.

183
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,800
Back then, to keep Zhu Yu in check,

184
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,379
after those from Sea and Clear Skies entrusted Qi to us,

185
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:06,220
Young Huan accompanied her for over a decade.

186
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,819
He always took care of her and taught her with patience.

187
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:13,640
That was because Qi wanted to be close to only him.

188
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:22,479
Later, Qi disappeared, and when she came back, Yue Jinzhao was by her side.

189
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:28,700
You thought Qi had a far deeper bond with Yue Jinzhao than with Young Huan,

190
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,299
so you let the two of them stay in the Mortal Realm

191
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,519
and Young Huan was thus permanently replaced.

192
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,700
That still can't be a reason for him to break his vow.

193
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Young Huan isn't one to wallow in self-pity.

194
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,299
He can accept this.

195
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,600
It’s just that there will inevitably be some unwillingness.

196
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,719
Please don't blame him.

197
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:15,799
You should know, I never blame any of you.

198
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,280
No way...

199
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,140
Shifang, what are you looking at?

200
00:19:57,192 --> 00:19:58,240
Shh!

201
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,060
What's wrong?

202
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:06,240
Didn't you say last time that Zhaoyan and Xian Qing...?

203
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,040
Anyway, are they really...?

204
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,112
Yeah.

205
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,800
You-You don't think that they're...?

206
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
Well-matched. 
  (The word for well-matched also sounds like a word to remove bad luck) 

207
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Young Yue, we're all good friends.

208
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,600
There's no need to curse them.

209
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,839
Shifang, it was "well-matched."

210
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,500
Match...

211
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:53,360
Are you still hesitating about whether to tell everyone you're a woman?

212
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,200
I've gotten used to being seen as a man.

213
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Spitting the truth about being a woman... feels somewhat difficult.

214
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,400
But we're thick-and-thin friends.

215
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I shouldn't keep it a secret.

216
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,600
Let's go.

217
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Miss Yue.

218
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,300
Miss Yue. Shifang.

219
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,700
Sorry, actually... actually, I'm a girl.

220
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Girls' clothes are so pretty. Zhaoyan, you should wear them more often.

221
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,900
I mistook you and Xian Qing as...

222
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But now it seems I wasn't totally mistaken.

223
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,200
No, no, I was wrong.

224
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,699
Was I wrong or not?

225
00:21:59,699 --> 00:22:01,900
It's just that before, you...

226
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,400
Shifang, let's go. You talk too much.

227
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,500
 Wait! S-She really is a girl? 

228
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,300
They already knew?

229
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,100
Whether you present yourself as a man or a woman, it's your own affair.

230
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,400
As long as you like it.

231
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Jinzhao!

232
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,900
What's the matter?

233
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,200
What's wrong? Are you still thinking about Bian Luohuan?

234
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,100
I'm wondering if he's my twin brother or not.

235
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,700
You, me, and Bian Luohuan.

236
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,100
What kind of relationship do the three of us have?

237
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,400
What are you doing?

238
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
Why think so much?

239
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,400
During the past three years, haven't we been taking it one day at a time?

240
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,500
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

241
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,200
You're particularly right.

242
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,056
We've reached Wuyan Village.

243
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,079
Didn't we come here the last time we visited the Pureness?

244
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,760
So the village is right below it.

245
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
- Be careful. 
 - Yue Jinzhao, I never thought we would come back.

246
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,100
Yes, it's just like a dream.

247
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
All houses have been renovated. 
    

248
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
Life is much better than before.

249
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
This really is a place of peace.

250
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,100
Yes, and the people here were really nice to us.

251
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,300
Miss Yue, you've returned.

252
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,500
- Come on. 
 - Isn't that...?

253
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
Go, hurry.

254
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,800
Shifang, what do you want to eat in a bit?

255
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,900
I want to eat... I want to eat-eat...

256
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,000
- Egg noodles. 
 - Egg noodles.

257
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,600
Let's head back first.

258
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,700
Where is your house then?

259
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,600
- The most dilapidated one. 
 - Let's go.

260
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,800
Three years ago, Jinzhao and I lived right here.

261
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,800
It seems life wasn't easy for you two.

262
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,200
Back then, Jinzhao and I relied on each other.

263
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,300
There was only this house here, so we lived together.

264
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Back then, he wouldn't keep his hands to himself—

265
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,100
What are you saying?

266
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Why are you covering my mouth again?

267
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,700
Aren't you afraid I'll tell everyone about how you were always taking my bed?

268
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,800
You made it sound a bit strange. Do you realize that?

269
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,000
What's so strange? You always took my bed back then.

270
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,300
All right, let's talk business.

271
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,000
Then let's clean up this place. We'll rest here tonight.

272
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Okay.

273
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,600
Those three villagers earlier were carrying this type of crystal.

274
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,800
Back then, Jinzhao used this kind of crystal

275
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
to exchange for our travel expenses out of the village.

276
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
It's quite valuable.

277
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,700
This crystal can also make Dou Bao stronger.

278
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,700
This village used to be extremely poor.

279
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,300
But now, it's much better than when we left.

280
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,000
It seems that the villagers have been selling crystals to the Qiyuan Sect in secret.

281
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,700
That's how they revived the village.

282
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,800
But the villagers all seem very kind.

283
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,400
How could they do such a thing?

284
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,900
Maybe they don't even know what the Qiyuan Sect has done.

285
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,900
Qi is right. Wuyan Village is located in a remote area.

286
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,900
They just want to improve their lives.

287
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,800
If the villagers are in cahoots with the sect,

288
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,900
it will be difficult for us to get any information out of them.

289
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,400
Rather than asking the villagers, it's better to lure out the person behind them.

290
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,500
Yes. We can lure them out with the crystals.

291
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,000
How do we do it?

292
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Let's start with Madam Shi.

293
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
She's in charge of the village's affairs. Right?

294
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,600
If the village really has something to do with the Qiyuan Sect,

295
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,900
she must be aware of it.

296
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,800
You're really clever.

297
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,200
- Madam Shi. 
 - Madam Shi.

298
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,700
Young Yue and Young Qi!

299
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,600
How come you're here?

300
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
Let me have a look. You've grown more and more beautiful.

301
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,900
Madam Shi, we wanted to ask about something from three years ago.

302
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
Something from three years ago?

303
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,000
Yes. Three years ago, did you see someone who looked exactly like me?

304
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,300
Someone who looked exactly like you?

305
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,600
No, I didn't. Why do you ask?

306
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,100
What about Uncle Lin Yuan?

307
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,900
He was the one who found us in the mine and brought us to the village.

308
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Him, I know. He stayed in this village with you for a while.

309
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,700
But he left right after you did.

310
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,500
Oh, right! It seems someone spotted him near the mine.

311
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,700
You can try looking for him there.

312
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,799
There's one more thing, Madam Shi.

313
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,520
We came here to investigate the Dragon Crystals in this village.

314
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,600
This crystal was found at the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

315
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,800
I-I-I don't know anything about a Qiyuan Sect.

316
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,700
Madam Shi, the Qiyuan Sect has committed many evils.

317
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,400
You mustn't help them.

318
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,700
Madam Shi, please tell us.

319
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,700
I-I-I have no idea! Young Yue. Young Qi.

320
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
Don't ask about this anymore. Okay?

321
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
Hurry and leave.

322
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,400
- Madam Shi. 
- Madam Shi.

323
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Come on.

324
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Judging from Madam Shi's reaction, the village must be in collusion with the Qiyuan Sect.

325
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,100
And she refused to say anything.

326
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,100
Let's split up.

327
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,300
- Okay. 
 - Hmm.

328
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Brother Luo, Miss Ming and Shifang, you all go look over there.

329
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,700
Qi and I will take this side.

330
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:16,020
Is there really something suspicious with Madam Shi?

331
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,600
I'm not sure either.

332
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,100
It doesn't seem like it.

333
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,600
Senior Xian Qing?

334
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:36,400
Xian Qing, you're top-notch in disguise.

335
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,400
I can't understand you, Xian Qing. Can you speak human words?

336
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,100
He's probably saying...

337
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,700
- Saying what? 
 - He's saying,

338
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,860
why do you all make the same mistake as Zhaoyan, mistaking the wrong dog?

339
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,700
Speaking of surveillance, I'll stay behind.

340
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,300
Then will you turn into a dog to keep watch?

341
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,800
What? Xian Qing is a high-level demon. How could he use such lowly tricks?

342
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,200
What's a high-level demon?

343
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,700
Don't ask so many questions.

344
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
There's demonic aura.

345
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:20,520
Let's go take a look.

346
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,100
Stop!

347
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,300
Uncle Lin Yuan!

348
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,000
You almost scared me to death.

349
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,200
Young Qi? Young Yue?  What are you doing here?

350
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,700
Uncle Lin Yuan, what are you doing here?

351
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,200
I-I-I was just passing by Wuyan Village,

352
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,800
so I came in for a stroll and bumped into you.

353
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,400
Then did you just notice someone suspicious passing by?

354
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,800
Suspicious person? No.

355
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,400
We lost them.

356
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Uncle Lin Yuan, I want to ask you something.

357
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Go ahead.

358
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,600
When you found us three years ago, were there other people around us?

359
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,800
Why do you suddenly ask this?

360
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,000
Uncle Lin Yuan, please think carefully. This is very important for Jinzhao.

361
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Was there someone... who looked exactly like me?

362
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,200
No, when I found you at the entrance of the village three years ago, you were just lying there.

363
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,500
I thought you were dead. It gave me quite a fright.

364
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,000
But later on, I found out you were all right, so I brought you to the village.

365
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
Young Qi, how have you been these three years?

366
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Over the years, Jinzhao and I have always been traveling.

367
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
We've been to many places and eaten lots of delicious food.

368
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,700
And made many good friends.

369
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,200
You've even made friends? That's great.

370
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,700
Hey, brat, don't be so anxious.

371
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,800
You're always chasing after things out of reach.

372
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,600
Smell the roses and the people around you.

373
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Cherish the present. Right?

374
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,400
I've been staying nearby recently. Come to me if you're in need.

375
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,900
- Goodbye, Uncle Lin Yuan. 
 - Okay, I'm off. Bye!

376
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
Let's go.

377
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,800
 I don't know why Young Yue and Young Qi have returned. 

378
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,000
 Since three years ago, we started gathering the Dragon Crystals, 

379
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,200
 I-I-I've always remembered what you said. 

380
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,100
 We can't let others know what we're doing. 

381
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,220
But now they've tracked it all the way here.

382
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,100
Young Yue and Young Qi are innocent.

383
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,500
Please have mercy and let them go.

384
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,300
 If you don't want everyone in your village to die, 

385
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,000
then do as I say.

386
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
Why hasn't Xian Qing returned yet?

387
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,760
Young Zhaoyan, are you worried about me?

388
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,500
I smell a demon.

389
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,000
Because we went to chase a demon.

390
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,100
No, you must have come into contact with a demon,

391
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,700
as it's such a strong demonic aura.

392
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,900
And it's similar to that of Shuo Xuan, who we encountered in Luori Village.

393
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,539
M-M-Miss Shuo Xuan?

394
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:59,799
Miss Yue and Young Master Yue, you said you ran into Uncle Lin Yuan while going after a demon.

395
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,000
Could it be that Uncle Lin Yuan is a demon?

396
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,900
I've always considered him my savior.

397
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,499
Today, I saw he was wearing a scale just like Shuo Xuan's.

398
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,800
Are they both really in on it?

399
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,600
Doesn't that mean they saved us twice?

400
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,100
Once was when we woke up in Wuyan Village,

401
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,600
and another time by the Yinma River.

402
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,319
Why didn't they tell us?

403
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,800
I've always suspected that Shuo Xuan knew you.

404
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,600
If Uncle Lin Yuan and Shuo Xuan are in it together, they must know our origins.

405
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,400
But he watched us bustle about without saying a word.

406
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,100
Why? Why do this to us?

407
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,000
Don't be so anxious.

408
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,800
How about I go capture Uncle Lin Yuan and torture him to spill the truth about our origins?

409
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Torture him? Can you really do it?

410
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,900
Seems like I can't.

411
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,900
Lin Yuan seems to have been watching us in secret.

412
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,900
Let's see what he's really up to first.

413
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,600
And that person behind Madam Shi has appeared.

414
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
They call this kind of crystal rock the Dragon Crystal.

415
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,800
They also plan to lead us to the mine tomorrow.

416
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Someone will be waiting for us there.

417
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,499
All right, it seems the mastermind is coming out.

418
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:32,300
 Young Qi. 

419
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,800
 - Young Yue.  
 - Madam Shi.

420
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,900
- Young Yue. 
 - Madam Shi.

421
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,600
Young Qi.

422
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,100
Please have a seat.

423
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No, thanks.

424
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:57,000
The crystals are at the location marked on this map.

425
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The buyer will go to the mine tomorrow.

426
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,300
You should... You should go tomorrow.

427
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,500
All right. Since the Qiyuan Sect has set a trap for us,

428
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,800
let's beat them at their own game then.

429
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,600
   

430
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:40,080


431
