 "Miracle" - JS 

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,000
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,700
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,900
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,500
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,900
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,100
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,300
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:38,500
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

19
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,400
   

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
   

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Is there any other way?

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,700
I knew it would come to this.

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
If there was another way to save Young Huan,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
you wouldn't make this choice.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,000
I knew the answer, but I couldn't help but ask again.

26
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,160
I was hoping to find evidence in the past three years...

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,620
to prove that the past could be changed.

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I even kept him away from Mangwan Village.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,399
But in the end, nothing has changed.

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,760
Back then, you delayed Zhu Yu's transformation

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,199
with the power of Mist Soul to contain her.

32
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,520
So, you were cursed, causing a severe decline in your internal organs.

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Otherwise, you would've chosen to resonate with Qi by yourself, and borne it yourself.

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,080
All these years,

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,000
Young Huan and I have always been afraid of losing you.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,200
Today,

37
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,200
you're getting a taste of this feeling.

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,200
You're afraid, aren't you?

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,700
It's perfectly normal...

40
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,500
to be afraid of losing loved ones.

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,000
All these years, Young Huan and I have been afraid of losing you.

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,100
Eldest Brother. Second Sister. Where is Third Brother going? He wouldn't tell me.

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,100
He's going somewhere far, far away.

44
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Third Brother, it's getting late. They're not coming.

45
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,956
It's not time yet.

46
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,199
Did something happen to Jinzhao and Young Yue?

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Guards.

48
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Commander Ying, you really are ruthless.

49
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,500
What? Are you going to grab us and throw us over?

50
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm asking you to stay.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,500
Let's see if you can.

52
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,200
What's the matter? Ying Xuwei?

53
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,300
You don't trust us that much?

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Jinzhao! Young Yue!

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,100
You shouldn't have come back.

56
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,600
We'd never abandon our friends.

57
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,248
You're right.

58
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Of course. I wouldn't misjudge someone.

59
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,459
I'm ready. Let's go.

60
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,956
Let's go.

61
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,704
Let's go.

62
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,900
Second Sister. Xiaoyuan. Take care.

63
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,200
Second Sister, why can't I see Third Brother off?

64
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I want him to bring me gifts.

65
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,640
Have you copied the scriptures? Don't be so naughty.

66
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,200
I just want to see Third Brother off. I can copy them later.

67
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Anyway, Third Brother will help.

68
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,464
Bian Luohuan.

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You can still smile?

70
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,100
Would you rather see me cry?

71
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,936
True! f I were the one being sent to die, I'd be afraid too.

72
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,500
Just a few days ago, you saw me as a deadly enemy.

73
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,000
But now you're talking to me so calmly.

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,900
It's so strange.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
Strange, indeed.

76
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Consider it me feeling sorry for myself.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,080
Do you think we're the same?

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,300
I did wonder if we were the same person in the beginning.

79
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,700
But later, I realized that we were worlds apart.

80
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,300
But later, I realized that we were worlds apart.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,700
How so?

82
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,600
You're stingy, cheap, and slick with words.

83
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,700
Enough, enough.

84
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,100
I knew you wouldn't say anything nice.

85
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,700
But later... I slowly changed my opinion of you,

86
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,600
until I came to see you in a new light.

87
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
Forget it.

88
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,300
To be honest, I became who I am today partly thanks to you.

89
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,200
What you've been through made you who you are now.

90
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,100
Exactly. I'm just me.

91
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
Anyway, we're two completely different people.

92
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,700
Yes.

93
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,479
Now that I think about it,  "Yue Jinzhao" was the name I once chose for myself.

94
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
What does it mean?

95
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,819
Surpass the past self. Start anew from today.

96
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,960
It's a good name.

97
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,600
Why are they suddenly getting along?

98
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,619
Young Yue, back when you were treated like a cold weapon at Yujie Hub,

99
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:19,380
it must have been hard for you. Right?

100
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,620
Actually, my decade or so at Yujie Hub

101
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,219
wasn't as miserable as you all imagined.

102
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,152
How come?

103
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,560
Bian Luohuan was nice to me.

104
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,919
He accompanied me while I grew up, educated me, and taught me swordplay.

105
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,179
He would try his best to give me whatever I wanted.

106
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,919
Well...

107
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,900
 What do I say to that? 

108
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,221
But a bird kept in a cage

109
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:04,160
lives in an illusion without freedom, after all.

110
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,979
It's different when I'm with Jinzhao.

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,619
He showed me around the Mortal Realm for three years.

112
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:19,340
There may have been hardships, but I was truly alive.

113
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,380
The Resonance Spell between us was never about control.

114
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,279
It's the bond between us.

115
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,808
Thanks.

116
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,219
Commander Ying, by decree of Her Lordship, enter the hall alone.

117
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,020
Brother Ying, we'll wait for you here.

118
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,584
Miss Shuo Xuan.

119
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,639
Do you know what the Qiyuan Orbs are for?

120
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,979
The Hengdao Sect offers them to Her Lordship to keep their sad little spring safe.

121
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:37,560
Each orb is a human life.

122
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,000
They don't even feel guilty about it.

123
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,939
Why should I?

124
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:46,519
Besides, without the Qiyuan Orbs,

125
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,140
how would Her Lordship cure my people?

126
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,224
So... that's what you think about this.

127
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,260
Are you troubled because you don't know whom to side with if we have to fight Shuo Xuan?

128
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,330
No.

129
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,040
I'm worried about Jinzhao and Young Yue.

130
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:28,639
Miss Shuo Xuan and I want to protect different things.

131
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,921
Miss Shuo Xuan, goodbye.

132
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:56,619
You want to enter Mist Soul.

133
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,004
Yes.

134
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,080
What if I won't allow it?

135
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,680
Once upon a time, Shennong said,

136
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,340
"What has passed is all predestined and bound to happen.

137
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,599
If someone forcibly changes history and disrupts the stream of time,

138
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:29,580
it will lead to the collapse and chaos of the entire universe."

139
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,580
Bian Luohuan went through Mist Soul to exchange for Yue Jinzhao.

140
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,939
The encounter between Yue Jinzhao and Qi is an established history.

141
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:46,580
If you insist on preventing us from entering Mist Soul

142
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,900
to prohibit Young Huan from exchanging for Yue Jinzhao,

143
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,479
then Qi wouldn't meet Jinzhao and history would be changed.

144
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,140
The entire universe would then collapse.

145
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,200
The Yu Clan would also cease to exist.

146
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,360
Even if I don't grant you access to Mist Soul,

147
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,279
other factors will ensure that the story takes the predestined course.

148
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,639
Ying Xuwei, I can allow you to enter Mist Soul.

149
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,520
But... I want the key ring of Rehai in exchange.

150
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,800
Someone will bring it here once they enter Mist Soul.

151
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,099
All right. If you break your word,

152
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:54,599
I swear I will wipe out Yujie Hub.

153
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,320
We're here.

154
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
I don't know why Her Lordship let you all in.

155
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,560
Eldest Brother, open up Mist Soul.

156
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:19,020
The Time Rift will only last for a moment. Hurry!

157
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,968
Let's go inside.

158
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,168
Come on.

159
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,760
Third Brother.

160
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,319
Yes, Eldest Brother? What is it?

161
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,528
Go on.

162
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,096
Take care, all of you.

163
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,200
This place seems detached from reality.

164
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,179
It's more desolate than the other springs.

165
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,139
It's emptier, as if it's no longer in this world.

166
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:45,179
The Split Abyss and the Time Rift are beyond the Six Realms.

167
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,260
They are indeed otherworldly.

168
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,440
We managed to get here thanks to fate.

169
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,739
How do we determine which point in time to return to?

170
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:59,680
The stream of time will tell us.

171
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,459
It may be dangerous.

172
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:14,040
Wait for us outside just in case.

173
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,400
Okay.

174
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,248
Let's go.

175
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,512
Let's go.

176
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,900
This is the secret chamber of Luori Village.

177
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,780
Aren't we supposed to go back to Yujie Hub? How did we end up here?

178
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,780
The stream of time led us here for a reason.

179
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,900
What about the slaves?

180
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Don't worry, our past selves will save them.

181
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,000
It's the box we used to store the Qiyuan Orbs.

182
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,200
- Watch out for the trap! 
 - Qi!

183
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:24,499
Oh, right! You're the one who set up the trap.

184
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,499
You forgot everything, yet you risked yourself for me.

185
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,300
You're my master after all.

186
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Shifang.

187
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
Give me the Dragon Crystal.

188
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,800
Okay.

189
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,700
This Dragon Crystal led us to Wuyan Village.

190
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,960
There, we met Uncle Lin Yuan and learned about Qi's identity.

191
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Now, we must guide our future selves to do the same things.

192
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
It's us from three years ago, hurry up.

193
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
How did it go?

194
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,500
It seems that once we do our job, we'll be sent back here.

195
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,800
That saves us a lot of trouble then.

196
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Let's go. It's time to steal my past self.

197
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Everyone, this only concerns the three of us.

198
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,400
Let us deal with it.

199
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Okay, let's meet up here later.

200
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,900
Qi, let's go.

201
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,100
   

202
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
 Master! 

203
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,900
 Master, take me to the Mortal Realm for fun, please. 

204
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,600
 Naughty kid. Practice your swordplay. All you think about is playing. 

205
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,000
 Master, I've lain in the Sea of Clouds for a decade as a Kun. 

206
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,100
 Then I stayed in Yujie Hub for years in the human form. 

207
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,400
 It's been a whole decade and more already. 

208
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,900
 I've come to know every single ant here. 

209
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,300
 Master, please. Take me to the Mortal Realm, please. 

210
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,800
 Please, you've been nagging so much that my ears are developing calluses. 

211
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,700
 Look! It's all tough. 

212
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,000
 - All thanks to you. 
 - There's nothing there. 

213
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
 I beg you take me out for some fun. 

214
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,600
 I really want some fun. 

215
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
 Master, you're the best. Please take me out. 

216
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,500
 Fine, fine, fine. 

217
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,700
 Go practice at the Hundred Feet Spring Platform. 

218
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,700
 I'll go plead with Eldest Brother to see if I can take you out. All right? 

219
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,400
 You must keep your word. 

220
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,500
 Of course. When have I ever gone back on my word? 

221
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,200
It's only been three years,

222
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,000
yet it feels like a lifetime ago.

223
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

224
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,800
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

225
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,600
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

226
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,500
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

227
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,600
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

228
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,400
Let's go. It's time to steal your past self.

229
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,600
Wait. Let me do it.

230
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,270
Can I...

231
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,200
have a minute alone with her?

232
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,800
I'd like to bid her farewell formally.

233
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:32,800
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

234
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:40,700
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

235
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:02,500
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

236
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:10,500
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

237
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:18,500
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

239
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,979
Master, I know it's you.

240
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,100
Master, stop hiding. Hurry, come out.

241
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Has Commander Ying agreed to take us to the Mortal Realm?

242
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:58,759
Master, what's wrong with you? You're acting strange today.

243
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Qi, your Thought Sword originates from your thoughts.

244
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Do you know your mission behind that sword?

245
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
 My mission behind the sword? 

246
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,900
Does carrying a sword mean I must kill people?

247
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,200
But I don't want to kill anyone.

248
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
Master, what are you doing?

249
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,200
Master.

250
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,364
Master, what are you doing?

251
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
I'm taking you...

252
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm really taking you to the Mortal Realm.

253
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,600
♫  One branch, two lifetimes of flowers  ♫

254
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
I've always wanted to give this to you.

255
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,300
♫  The sun rises, the moon sets, can they give you a tender answer?  ♫

260
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,500

269
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,800
 Bian Luohuan. 

270
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,800
So...

271
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,800
this is what I looked like when you first saw me?

283
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Get her out of here now.

284
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
 Third Brother? 

285
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
According to Ying Xuwei,

286
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,000
Bian Luohuan will tell him about the exchange here. Let's go.

287
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,100
Another person? What about you?

288
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Me?

289
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,100
I need to go to Dragon Pool to exchange for this person.

290
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,820
His name is...

291
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,900
Yue Jinzhao.

292
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,100
Yue Jinzhao.

293
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Eldest Brother, do you remember?

294
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,800
That's the name I once chose for myself.

295
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,100
My father passed when I was young and my mom was sick from being overworked.

296
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,000
She would hit me, curse me, and ended up abandoning me.

297
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:07,400
I got this scar on my face from back then.

298
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,500
You found me wandering the street

299
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,700
and brought me back to Yujie Hub.

300
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,100
You asked for my name. I said my name was Yue Jinzhao.

301
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,800
Surpass the past self. Start anew from today.

302
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,100
Do you remember what you said to me back then?

303
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,400
To avoid the past is to run from it.

304
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,500
Only by facing it, can you truly move beyond it.

305
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,180
Yes.

306
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,800
Indeed.

307
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,800
How I wish I could see Second Sister and Xiaoyuan again.

308
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm off.

309
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,300
Young Huan.

310
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:27,300
Eldest Brother, you're the strongest among us.

311
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,000
You've been sheltering me from all the wind and rain since I was a child.

312
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,200
I'll... trouble you one more time.

313
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
Eldest Brother.

314
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,100
This time,

315
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,040
it's really farewell.

316
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Eldest Brother, take care.

317
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,400
Young Huan.

318
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,100
Old Third.

319
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,480
Third Brother.

320
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,600
Two Young Yue's.

321
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,400
It's so weird. So surreal.

322
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,100
She doesn't know us at this point.

323
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,400
She doesn't look like someone who would grab someone's fur.

324
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,300
The sleeping one looks more quiet.

325
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,800
Miss Yue.

326
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
Zhaoyan, it's all right.

327
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,200
I know you're all just trying to cheer me up.

328
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Don't worry. I know what to do.

329
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,300
You have three years left. Cherish these happy days.

330
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,000
Have you told him the full story?

331
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,200
We should head to our next destination.

332
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,060


333
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,700
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

334
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,800
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

335
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,700
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

336
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,700
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

337
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,600
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

338
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,900
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

339
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:45,544
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

340
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:53,832
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

341
00:38:53,832 --> 00:39:01,768
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

342
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:09,544
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

343
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:30,728
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

344
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:34,728
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

345
00:39:34,728 --> 00:39:39,912
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

346
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:46,760
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

347
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,796
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

348
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,800
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

349
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,800
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

350
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:11,700
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

351
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:19,700
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

352
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:27,700
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

353
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:35,700
♫  I'm destined to give my all for you  ♫

354
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:43,800
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

355
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,800
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

356
00:40:51,800 --> 00:41:01,600
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫
