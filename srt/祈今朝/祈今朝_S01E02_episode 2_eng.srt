See?

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,639
Only the true Lord Ming can make these soul fish ascend.

24
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:12,220
She is the omnipotent and omniscient Lord Ming.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,460
Shut up. Or I'll kill you both.

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,620
What is the Qiyuan Orb? Where did it come from?

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,659
It is from human sacrifices...

28
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:23,359
Lord Ming!

29
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,559
Don't try to hurt Qi.

30
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:32,019
They called her Lord Ming. Didn't you hear it?

31
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,179
She is not Lord Ming.

32
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:36,909
Seeing is believing. You're refusing to face the truth.

33
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:39,559
Out of my way. I don't harm the innocent.

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,879
She is innocent.

35
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,879
Is she?

36
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,539
The Qiyuan Sect harms the civilians. Is she innocent then?

37
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,520
Sir!

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,060
- Let's go. 
 - But Lord Ming...

39
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,199
- Inform Shengxuan of this. Go. 
 - Shengxuan?

40
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,014
- Move. 
 - Okay. Inform him of this.

41
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,379
Yue Jinzhao, if you don't stop, I will not show you any mercy.

42
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,400
My family will never associate with evil people.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,299
If you try to harm Qi, you'll have to kill me first.

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,619
Move aside. I don't want to kill you.

45
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,659
You claim to be righteous.

46
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,479
Then prove that she is the Lord Ming.

47
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,839
She has consumed those evil beings. Isn't that proof?

48
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,540
Do you have any evidence she isn't Lord Ming?

49
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,086
If she were Lord Ming,

50
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:46,143
why would she take action against the Qiyuan Sect?

51
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,120
Let me save her.

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
Thank you.

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,190
Qi.

54

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
Can you hear me?

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
 Qi, it's me, Jinzhao. 

59
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,710
 Qi. 

60
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,429
 Jinzhao didn't ignore me. 

61
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,949
 All of you, get away from me. 

62
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,280
 Jinzhao. 

63
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,179
 The Kun Clan never shed tears. 

64
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,039
 But she's crying. 

65
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,839
Qi.

66
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,980

I am Jinzhao.

70
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,719
Jinzhao.

71
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,019
Jinzhao didn't abandon me.

Lord Shengxuan.

Fujin Hall can't serve as a stronghold.

111

You guys go to the sub-branch in Luori Village and lay low.

 - Yes.

00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,879
Out of here.

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,689
Lord Shengxuan, here is one thing I still don't understand.

116
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:42,593
The girl called Qi...

117
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:44,679
Is she really Lord Ming?

118
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,770
What about it?

119
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,790
Do you have any problems with that?

120
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,100
No, I don't have any problems.

121
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,019
I shall take my leave and set off immediately.

122
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,799
 Qi. 

123
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,948
 Yue Jinzhao. 
   

124
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,451
 I'll wait for you at Luori Village. 

125
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:31,978
 No. I am not... I am not Lord Ming. 

126
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,819
 Qi. 

127
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:40,220
 Are you really Lord Ming? 

128
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,399
It doesn't matter.

129
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,197
You are still my Qi.

130
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,229
 Brother Yue, the physician is here. 

131
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,400
Physician, how is she?

132
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,500
Well, she is unharmed.

133
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,739
And she's energetic and in good health.

134
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:23,719
How is that possible? She's unconscious.

135
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,700
Clearly, she has fallen asleep.

136
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,680
Fallen asleep?

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,838
Did she really fall asleep?

138
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,820
Egg noodles.

139
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,439
Jinzhao, don't snatch my egg noodles.

140
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,410
- I'll tell someone to cook it. 
 - Wait.

141
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,600
I've been keeping my word all the way.

142
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,339
So...

143
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,319
You're indeed a man of your word.

144
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,839
So?

145
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,705
So, five bowls of egg noodles.

146
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
No problem.

147
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Wait, Brother Yue.

148
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,800
I hear you two are figuring out your origins.

149
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,359
Yes.

150
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
We woke up in Wuyan Village three years ago.

151
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
We remembered nothing but our names.

152
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,800
At first, we thought we were no different from others.

153
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,360
But later we discovered that we were born with martial skills.

154
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,157
So, we want to find out who we are.

155
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,024
Even if she is Lord Ming,

156
00:11:58,024 --> 00:12:01,879
it's better than not knowing where one comes from.

157
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,079
What was the magic you used on Miss Yue today at Fujin Hall?

158
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,280
Over the past few years, we've been traveling.

159
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,339
To earn some money, we have to do a little something.

160
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,040
I then happened to discover,

161
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,359
we can communicate with our minds and transfer thoughts.

162
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:31,219
I never really thought about what this magic was called.

163
00:12:31,219 --> 00:12:33,040
I have an idea.

164
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,040
How about I call it omnipotent telepathy?

165
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
Where is he?

166
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,100
He's so rude. I hadn't finished talking.

167
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,839
As long as they act properly, they are my guests.

168
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,630
- Take care of them. 
  - Yes. 

169
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,080
Sit.

170
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,253
Don't you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

171
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,753
No.

172
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:27,622
I do.

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,380
I feel I've become more powerful.

174
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,020
Can you finish speaking in one go?

175
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,840
I know you're worried about me.

176
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,859
I'm not.

177
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,240
Do you know that you cried today?

178
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,980
You never shed tears before.

179
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,859
I cried?

180
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,705
Did you see something?

181
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,407
I saw that I was trapped in a cave.

182
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:08,069
When I heard strange voices saying that you had abandoned me,

183
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,990
you showed up,

184
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,900
and I was protected.

185
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,660
Jinzhao? Jinzhao?

186
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,960
You...

187
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,600
Why are you crying again?

188
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,879
I am hungry. I want to eat egg noodles.

189
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,859
Can you give them all to me?

190
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,340
 Here are the egg noodles. 

191
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,559
Okay.

192
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,040
I won’t rob you, I’ll give it all to you.

193
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,539
 Turns out tears are this useful. 

194
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,180
Maiming.

195
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,340
 It seems you have good news to share with me. 

196
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,764
Today, we destroyed the branch of the Qiyuan Sect in Yinghui Fort.

197
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,519
And we eliminated spoils.

198
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,179
Other treasures will be returned tomorrow.

199
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:16,158
I need you to check the account books to find out more clues.

200
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,200
 As you wish, the reputation of the Luo family can be spread. 

201
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,539
However, I'm not the only one who destroyed Fujin Hall.

202
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,669
A pair of siblings helped.

203
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,168
Jinzhao.

204
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:40,547
Why could I consume the Qiyuan Orb?

205
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:42,889
And why did I see the past?

206
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,830
Where did the strange voices come from?

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
All right.

208
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,852
One day, we will figure it out.

209
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,730
Am I really Lord Ming?

210
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,460
Of course not.

211
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,199
Along the way, we haven't done many good deeds,

212
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,319
but we haven't done anything bad.

213
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,759
Don't be silly.

214
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,560
If you were Lord Ming, my name would be Zhaojin.

215
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,257
Jinzhao? Zhaojin?

216
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:20,419
Sounds like you're rich. 
  (T/N: homophone of 'attract wealth') 

217
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:23,480
But I think Jinzhao is better.

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,800
If I meet those Qiyuan disciples again,

219
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,360
will they bow and kneel to me?

220
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,099
That's great.

221
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,287
You must not give it away. You need to order them to give their treasures to us.

222
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,040
Good idea. We'll get rich.

223
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,480
Once we become rich, we will have noodles with ten eggs.

224
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,299
Good for you.

225
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,280
So, can you give me the money you got in Fujin Hall in advance?

226
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm not that stupid. Let's talk business.

227
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,010
All right.

228
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,680
It's been three years since we started searching for our origins.

229
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,199
This is the first time we found such a clear clue.

230
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,809
Yes. So I'm very flustered now.

231
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:14,879
It means my left eye's premonition was accurate.

232
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:18,160
As long as we follow Luo Zhaoyan, we will definitely find more clues.

233
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,500
Exactly. We will follow him from now on.

234
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,300
No matter where he goes,

235
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,160
 ...keep a close eye on him. 

236
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
Good.

237
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:34,190
 So you're saying Yue Qi is suspected to be Lord Ming. 

238
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,920
And she behaved differently from others.

239
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,019
 Zhaoyan, the experiences of the Yue siblings are strange. 

240
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:46,999
Why not let them go back with you and investigate them slowly?

241
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:50,390
Okay. Then I will take them back with me.

242
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,059
Maiming, have an early rest.

243
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,340
Zhaoyan, anything else?

244
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:03,209
I'm well. Don't worry.

245
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,060
Cang Feng.

246
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,510
Before Zhaoyan returns,

247
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,680
I want to know all about the siblings' past.

248
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,080
 Yes. 

249
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,129
- Jinzhao. 
 - Qi.

250
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:22,580
I have something very, very important to tell you.

251
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,380
What is it?

252
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,700
In another hour, our birthday will be over!

253
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:35,740
This is...

254
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,640
Your birthday gift.

255
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,960
Well...

256
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,579
So it was you who bought the white one.

257
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,299
Wait.

258
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,599
What's wrong?

259
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,480
You already bought one?

260
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,999
Give it back to me.

261
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,919
The gift already given, the water has already poured out. You can't take it back.

262
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,920
As for this, originally I bought it for myself.

263
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,439
Seeing that you saved me, I'll give it to you as a birthday gift.

264
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,539
What a surprise.

265
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,339
I used to give you birthday presents.

266
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:21,680
This is your first time gifting me something.

267
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,439
Since when did you learn to care for others?

268
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,960
If you don't want it, give it back.

269
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,440
The gift already given, the water has already poured out. You can't take it back.

270
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,140
Give it to me.

271
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,890
Wait.

272
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,380
Look!

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
These two seem to be a pair.

274
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
Right?

275
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,600
Annoying Jinzhao.

276
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,800
He lied to me about my birthday gift.

277
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,100
Will he expect me to give all the tasty food to him?

278
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Forget it, he got me a birthday gift.

279
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm okay with letting him have the food.

280
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,800
What is this?

281
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,900
 Is it an illusion? 

282
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,800
All right, move it away.

283
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,200
Yes.

284
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,200
Brother Luo Luo, what is this?

285
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,900
You two, this is Steward Luo of my trade house.

286
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm having him return the treasures seized from Fujin Hall to their owners.

287
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,900
What?

288
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,000
Jinzhao, yesterday at Fujin Hall, you picked up bank notes.

289
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Are they stolen goods?

290
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,200
I almost forgot.

291
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,100
Thank you for reminding me.

292
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
It's what I got yesterday.

293
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
You're a man of integrity.

294
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
A great man.

295
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,700
- Thank you, Master. 
 - Thank you, young hero.

296
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,800
Master, rest assured. I will ensure my job is done well.

297
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,400
I shall take my leave.

298
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Good.

299
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Let's go.

300
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,800
Are you taking us to your home?

301
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Yes.

302
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,300
That's great.

303
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,200
I've heard it's a picturesque place. I've always wanted to visit it.

304
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,800
Please wait a moment. The carriage will be here shortly.

305
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,700
Guests. Sorry to interrupt.

306
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,200
Here's your bill.

307
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,400
Impossible. The bill was settled yesterday.

308
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,200
But this morning, you ordered fried eggs and tofu pudding.

309
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,100
Look. And last night, you took two steamed buns.

310
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,300
How could that be?

311
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,800
It must be you, a silly, gluttonous fish.

312
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,500
Who is silly?

313
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,900
The one who ate them.

314
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
You settle the bill yourself. Do you know why?

315
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,400
Let me tell you. Because all my money is stolen goods.

316
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,300
Miser!

317
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,500
Put it on my account.

318
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,000
All right.

319
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,400
Luo Luo, you're so generous.

320
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,844
   

321
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
Miss Yue.

322
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
Stop, you two.

323
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,200
I know you two are close. But how about letting me go first?

324
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,900
- No way. 
 - No way.

325
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,400
 Jinzhao, you're so strange today. 

326
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,200
 Wasn't it you who wanted me to get closer to Brother Zhaoyan? 

327
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Plans have changed. Just listen to me.

328
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 I don't want to. 

329
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
You hungry?

330
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,900
Yes, I am.

331
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Delicious.

332
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,500
 The sister is naive, but the brother is witty. 

333
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,400
 I should be wary of Yue Jinzhao. 

334
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,300
 Their identities are unclear. I need to investigate them carefully. 

335
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's go.

336
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,400
Brother Zhaoyan, does your home have tasty food?

337
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
Yes.

338
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,800
When we arrive, I'll have them make you egg noodles.

339
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Brother Zhaoyan, how did you know I love egg noodles?

340
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,200
I know. Brother Zhaoyan, you must like me.

341
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Storybooks say if you blush while staring at someone, it means you like them.

342
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,300
Miss Yue, don't mock me.

343
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,800
Brother Luo, Qi has read too many storybooks. Don't take it seriously.

344
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Brother Luo,

345
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,500
do you know about the Qiyuan Orb?

346
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,800
I've been tracking it. I do know about it.

347
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,500
Can you tell us about it?

348
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
When disciples join the Qiyuan sect,

349
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,400
the directors in various places, in the name of Lord Ming, distribute Qiyuan Orbs to them.

350
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,600
They cast spells to implant the Qiyuan Orbs into the bodies of the new disciples.

351
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,000
At first, these disciples are strong and healthy,

352
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
but over time, the Qiyuan Orbs begin to absorb the force from their bodies.

353
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,800
The soul fish is formed and stored within the Qiyuan Orbs.

354
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,300
When the soul fish flies out of the Qiyuan Orb,

355
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,800
those disciples will turn into stone statues.

356
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,600
The Qiyuan Sect claims they have ascended.

357
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,700
So every Qiyuan Orb represents a human life.

358
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,300
 I thought the Qiyuan Sect just scammed money. 

359
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
 I never expected it to kill people. 

360
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,000
 I can't let it happen. 

361
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Moreover, I always feel that Qi and I were deliberately led to Fujin Hall.

362
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,300
Deliberately led?

363
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,800
If Qi is Lord Ming, why would they dare to hurt her?

364
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,800
If the two of you are innocent, my family will not wrongly accuse you.

365
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,000
You're a good master of the Luo family.

366
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,600
You're so righteous.

367
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
A flatterer.

368
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,500
   

369
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,200
Who is it?

370
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
   

371
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,100
I'll kill you.

372
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,800
Help!

373
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
 Help! 

374
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,800
Someone is calling for help.

375
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,500
I will kill you.

376
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,600
Don't.

377
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,400
No. Miss, please believe me. I really didn't see anything.

378
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,200
Shut up. How dare you! I will take out your eyes!

379
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,400
- I really... 
 - Miss, please stop.

380
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
Help.

381
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Brother Shifang, what happened?

382
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Luo... Master Luo.

383
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Brother Zhaoyan, do you know him?

384
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,000
Is that Qi?

385
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
Master Luo, help!

386
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,300
Stay out of this, or I will slaughter you all.

387
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,600
Qi, pull him up first.

388
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,100
Are you okay?

389
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,500
Thank you for saving my life.

390
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,300
 Yue Qi, you fool. Why are you getting involved? 

391
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,400
I must shoot you dead.

392
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,800
 She seems to be hostile towards Qi. I need to test her. 

393
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,600
You made this lady so mad.

394
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
Because of you, Qi and I are blamed.

395
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,000
Don't try to play dumb.

396
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,400
 She is indeed sensitive to Qi. Does she know her? 

397
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,800
So, what do you want?

398
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,200
I must scratch his eyes out.

399
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,900
Miss, Brother Shifang made a mistake.

400
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,800
He should suffer some pain. But there's no need to be so cruel.

401
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Fine, you outnumber me.

402
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,200
I'll spare your eyes for now.

403
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,200
Hold on.

404
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,599
Well...

405
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Well... I'm sorry.

406
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,100
If you come within ten steps of me, I will make you disintegrate into ashes.

407
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,400
She wanted to dig out your eyes. Yet you still can't bear to see her leave?

408
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,900
You really fancy her?

409
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,200
I don't. I don't.

410
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
You're blushing.

411
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Brother Shifang, you're not deceiving us, are you?

412
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,200
I only saw a figure in the middle of the river.

413
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,200
 Strange. 

414
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,000
 I heard the iron poplar wood is nearby. 

415
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,700
 Why haven't I seen it? 

416
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,100
 Who is she? 

417
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,800
 Is she a demon? 

418
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,900
 Who is it? 

419
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,300
I swear I really didn't see anything.

420
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,300
The storybooks say if you blush, it means you like them.

421
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,900
Do you like her?

422
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,100
She's just joking with you.

423
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,200
Let's go, Qi.

424
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

425
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
- Let's go. 
 - I was so scared just now.

426
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,200
 Shuo Xuan, how is Qi after she ate the Qiyuan Orb? 

427
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,300
 Our Lord is very concerned. 

428
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
Rest assured, she's doing well.

429
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,100
She helped others go against me.

430
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,700
 Calm down. 

431
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,100
 I know when you came to check on Qi, the drought happened. 

432
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,200
 You long for water. It's understandable to expose yourself. 

433
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,100
 But the Lord gave you this mission. Be careful. 

434
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
It's all that fool's fault.

435
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,200
Because of him, I got exposed so early.

436
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,600
 From now on, you follow Qi. 

437
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,700
 You should be more careful. Don't get exposed again. 

438
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,300
I don't need your advice, Lin Yuan.

439
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,600
Smells good.

440
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,100
Jinzhao, is it done?

441
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,400
Almost.

442
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,100
Oh, right! Allow me to introduce you.

443
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,000
This is Yue Jinzhao.

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,800
She's Yue Qi.

445
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,800
He's Ju Shifang...  
    

446
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,600
from the Righteous Martial Alliance.

447
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Righteous Martial Alliance?

448
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,800
Righteous Martial Alliance works...

449
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,600
on eliminating demons and monsters.

450
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:13,200
Though it's formed by various factions, each faction has its own system.

451
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,200
In times of crisis, the alliance leader will give orders to fight against enemies together.

452
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,700
Miss Yue is really familiar with us.

453
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,400
Yes.

454
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,000
I often hear of you from storytellers.

455
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,800
I also know the alliance includes Brave Martial Hall, Cloud Stairway Hall, and Mechanic Skill Hall.

456
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Which hall are you from?

457
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,200
I am the head of the Mechanic Skill Hall.

458
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,900
- Really? 
 - So, you're a leader.

459
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,200
No big deal.

460
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
Thank you for your help again.

461
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,000
You two share the surname Yue.

462
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,200
I guess you are siblings.

463
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,800
- We just... 
 - Here Qi, it is done.

464
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Brother Shifang, Jincui Oasis is far from Righteous Martial Alliance.

465
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Why are you here?

466
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I came to find the iron poplar wood.

467
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,300
- Jinzhao, here. 
 - I wanted to try my luck at the Luo Mansion.

468
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,500
The 50-year-old dried iron poplar wood

469
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,400
is even lighter than a feather and as tough as iron,

470
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,700
making it more suitable for creating mechanical contrivances.

471
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, right.

472
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,200
Here, look.

473
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
This iron poplar wood is coarsely grained.

474
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,600
It requires 20 percent of Yuqi Tree sap

475
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,000
and 80 percent of the iron solution to be coated on it.

476
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,800
It might be a bit difficult for you to understand.

477
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,900
So, please take a look.

478
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,900
So cute!

479
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
It can move.

480
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,300
It is quite cute.

481
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,400
Its name is Dou Bao, and it can even fight.

482
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,000
Did you make it?

483
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,800
My mother gave it to me before she passed away, but I know mechanisms, too.

484
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,300
But I'm not highly skilled yet.

485
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,600
 Miss Yue looks so forthright. 

486
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,000
 Is she related to the Qiyuan Sect? 

487
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,200
   

488
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,680
 

489
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,100
Pureness, Cold Marrow, Mist Soul, Dragon Pool,

490
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Mirror, Flame Wave, Poison Miasma, Chunzi,

491
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
and Rehai.

492
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,100
Shennong feared that the Nine Springs 
    

493
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,700
would be misused, so he made nine key rings...

494
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,700
and gave them to nine guardians to guard the Nine Springs.

495
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,000
But has he ever considered the price...

496
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,800
that the guardians would have to pay?

497
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:30,080


498
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

499
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,600
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

500
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,600
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

501
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,500
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

502
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,600
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

503
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,400
♫  The years leave no trace behind  ♫

504
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,600
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

505
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
♫  I fill the page with my memories   ♫

506
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
♫  All about you  ♫

507
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,400
♫  All my laughter and joy is because of you  ♫

508
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
♫  All my life's unforgettable moments are because of you  ♫

509
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
♫  The past glides by scene by scene  ♫

510
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,400
♫  How many smiles and tears  ♫

511
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,700
♫  fell because of happiness  ♫

512
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,600
♫  I bitterly search thousands of rivers and mountains  ♫

513
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,700
♫  Alone in the empty valley, I hear my echo  ♫

514
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
♫  In the tranquility of this world   ♫

515
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,700
♫  I'm searching for your presence   ♫

516
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,800
♫  I'll spend the rest of my life with you   ♫

517
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,000
♫  Never forgetting this, I keep bitterly searching  ♫

518
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,400
♫  I hope to share the rest of my life's joy and sorrow with you  ♫

519
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
♫  Among the vast sea of people  ♫

520
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,200
♫  I engrave your name  ♫

521
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:59,000
♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

522
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,600
♫  Wait until the wind rises and the rain ceases  ♫

523
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,600
♫  Wait for the long lost silence  ♫

524
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,600
♫  Wait until we are close   ♫

525
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,500
♫  And watch the north star  ♫

526
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,600
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

527
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,400
♫  The stories leave no trace behind  ♫

528
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,600
