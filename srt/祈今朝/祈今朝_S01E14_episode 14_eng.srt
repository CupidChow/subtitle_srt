20
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,919
Someone is following us.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Jinzhao, what do you think the relationship between the person behind Madam Shi and Uncle Lin Yuan is?

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Catch that person, and we'll know.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Everyone, relax. Shifang and Miss Ming will assist us.

24
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,100
It's right ahead. Let's go.

25
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,959
Miss Ming, Jinzhao and the others have already gone in.

26
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,920
Why haven't the people of the Qiyuan Sect arrived yet?

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,240
No hurry.

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Here they come.

29
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
He carries the same scale as Miss Shuo Xuan.

30
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
He is Lin Yuan.

31
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,800
Something's not right.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
This is the place marked on the map.

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,700
Since they've lured us here, why don't they show up and kill us?

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,300
As expected, these are the Dragon Crystals.

35
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,000
Have they changed their plan?

36
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Interesting.

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Now, I can't feel the one who was following us.

38
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
But your Uncle Lin Yuan has appeared.

39
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,700
- Uncle Lin Yuan, how come you're here? 
 - Why are you here?

40
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
What a coincidence. I saw you all entering the mine.

41
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,800
I was worried about your safety, so I followed to check.

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,600
As long as you're safe, that's good.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,700
Young Yue. Young Qi. What's this for?

44
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,900
Uncle Lin Yuan, we already know you're a demon.

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,800
Uncle Lin Yuan, did you know about our past all along, and have been deceiving us?

46
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,100
There are some misunderstandings. Let's take this outside.

47
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Uncle Lin Yuan, please tell us the truth.

48
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,600
Enough talk. Just take him down.

49
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Qi.

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Oh, no!

51
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,700
Th-They're still inside.

52
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,800
M-Miss Ming, could you please think of something?

53
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Qi!

54
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,300
Jinzhao, are you all right?

55
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Yes. Crawl out slowly.

56
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,360
Jinzhao!

57
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,600
Jinzhao. Jinzhao?

58
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,100
Jinzhao, are you all right?

59
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you injured?

60
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
Xian Qing, I'm fine.

61
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,600
How about you? Are you hurt?

62
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,700
I can feel that you are hurt.

63
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm really fine.

64
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Don't rush.

65
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,500
I'll remove these rocks now to get you out.

66
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,400
Wait.

67
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,000
There was a collapse just now.

68
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
If we use force to remove them, there might be another one.

69
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,800
It won't be good if it endangers Brother Yue and Miss Yue.

70
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,000
It's your nature to always consider others first that worries me the most.

71
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,960
Jinzhao, wake up.

72
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Wake up.

73
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,220
Jinzhao, I thought you were dead.

74
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Jinzhao!

75
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,700
Why are you coughing blood?

76
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,300
Just because I was pinned by a rock.

77
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
I will be better soon.

78
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Jinzhao, hang in there. I will definitely get you out of here.

79
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,700
Silly, I'm not dead.

80
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,800
What are you crying for?

81
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll help you up.

82
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,100
Qi.

83
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Do you remember?

84
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,200
What?

85
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,000
After we woke up in Wuyan Village,

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I came to the same mine...

87
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
to earn travel expenses.

88
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,300
There was a collapse, too. I was trapped for seven days and nights.

 Jinzhao. 

110

 Say sorry.

Don't worry. I am here.

120

I won't let anything happen to you.

121
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
I know.

122
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
When we woke up, you already saved me once.

123
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,800
But now I am thinking,

124
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,500
thank goodness you didn't leave me.

125
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
And thank goodness,

126
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,179
we've always been by each other's side.

127
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Qi, who am I to you?

128
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,919
Qi.

129
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,200
Jinzhao, let's go.

130
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
Let's go.

131
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,100
- Zhaoyan. 
 - Xian Qing.

132
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,640
I am here.

133
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
I am here, too.

134
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
- Qi. Jinzhao. 
 - Zhaoyan.

135
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
- How are you two? 
 - Where is Senior Xian Qing?

136
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Zhaoyan, Jinzhao seems injured.

137
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,200
Do you have a way to move these stones?

138
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,600
Dou Bao!

139
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Jinzhao. Young Yue.

140
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ming Xiu. Shifang.

141
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,300
Dou Bao.

142
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,100
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

143
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,800
- Hurry up. 
 - Hurry up.

144
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,300
Hurry up.

145
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
That was close.

146
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,200
This time, the credit goes to Dou Bao.

147
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,800
This is my master's medicine. It works faster.

148
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Thanks.

149
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Are you injured?

150
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,000
It's not serious.

151
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Thank you for saving me just now.

152
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,500
Zhaoyan, you're too polite with me.

153
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,200
No.

154
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
How are you?

155
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm fine, Miss Ming. Thank you.

156
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,780
How are you now?

157
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,660
Better.

158
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,000
Jinzhao.

159
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:12,039
I'll answer your question when it's only us.

160
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I didn't expect this visit to Wuyan Village to not only yield nothing

161
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,500
but almost cost us our lives.

162
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,000
But it's not true that we got nothing.

163
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,360
Uncle Lin Yuan.

164
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,800
Lin Yuan.

165
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
 Come on. 

166
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
How could you have someone attack them like that?

167
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,500
Commander Ge, I had no intention of taking their lives.

168
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,000
I just wanted to trap them in the cave

169
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
to buy time to transport the last batch of the Dragon Crystals.

170
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,200
But General Lin Yuan suddenly appeared.

171
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,400
He must have followed us here.

172
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,000
The Sea of Clear Skies must have known we are collecting the Dragon Crystals

173
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and will intensify their vigilance against us.

174
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,000
It's my failure.

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
I must return immediately to report this matter to Eldest Brother.

176
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
Now that the Dragon Crystals have been fully collected,

177
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,300
you can withdraw to the Yujie Hub immediately.

178
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes.

179
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
 All right. 

180
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,100
 Help me pack it. 

181
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,600
Uncle Lin Yuan.

182
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
Where am I?

183
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Just confess.

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What should I confess?

185
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,600
The pain is killing me.

186
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,939
What's your relationship with Shuo Xuan?

187
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
What are you talking about?

188
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,100
I have no idea what you mean.

189
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
Who is Shuo Xuan?

190
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:33,159
You demon. Are you still not going to tell us?

191
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,560
It seems I can't hide it anymore.

192
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:45,320
Young Lord, please forgive my earlier rudeness.

193
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
Me?

194
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,600
Young Qi is actually the young lord of our Yu Clan.

195
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Fish? 
  (Homophones) 

196
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,300
- What? 
 - The Y-Yu Clan?

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,400
The Yu Clan are sea demons living in the Sea and Clear Skies.

198
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,600
Miss Yue is a demon?

199
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,900
But Young Yue has no demonic aura.

200
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,200
Her Lordship of the Yu Clan, Zhu Yu,

201
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,400
is a mythical beast that has existed since ancient times.

202
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
You can't compare her to any other demon.

203
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
You say Qi is your Lord's child.

204
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Then, why did you abandon her in the Mortal Realm,

205
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,900
completely ignoring her for three years?

206
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
This is Her Lordship's punishment for you, so you ended up becoming a mortal

207
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
stranded in the Mortal Realm.

208
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Punishment?

209
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,450
D-Did Young Yue do something wrong?

210
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,600
We have a forbidden technique called the Companion Life Spell.

211
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,000
If it's cast on someone,

212
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
that person will lose their memory

213
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
and their previous personality will be erased.

214
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,500
From then on, this person must live for the one who used the technique

215
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,200
and protect that person their whole life.

216
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Losing their personality and memory,

217
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,800
and living only for another person from then on.

218
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,500
Yes. Three years ago, our young lord traveled in the Mortal Realm.

219
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,400
When passing by Wuyan Village, she unintentionally used the Companion Life Spell on a young mortal.

220
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,800
Once this spell is cast, it can't be undone.

221
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
Her Lordship loves you,

222
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,200
but it was such a grave mistake, so you couldn't go unpunished.

223
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,700
Thus, Her Lordship erased your memory, turning you into a whole new person

224
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,600
to better reflect on yourself in the Mortal Realm.

225
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,500
Could that mortal youth be Brother Yue?

226
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,600
Over these three years,

227
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,300
we've also been asking around everywhere for Young Yue's origins.

228
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,600
But your background is very mysterious. It's still unknown to this day.

229
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,500
In that case, we could only leave you and our young lord in this village.

230
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
Her Lordship worries about you,

231
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
so she asked me and Shuo Xuan to protect you in secret.

232
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Then have you found the one who looks exactly like Jinzhao?

233
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,700
Jinzhao.

234
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,400
I want to go to the Sea and Clear Skies.

235
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,300
All right. Her Lordship misses you a lot.

236
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,799
I'll go too.

237
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,700
Then let's go together.

238
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you all going to the Demon Realm with a demon?

239
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,199
We are friends first.

240
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,300
The matters between mortals and demons come second.

241
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
Young Xiu.

242
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,000
Hanjiang usually can't bear to scold Young Xiu.

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,500
If he knew Young Xiu had no concern for companions,

244
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,900
it would be me who will get rebuked.

245
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,900
You're annoying!

246
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,700
No, I'm not.

247
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,439
You finally smiled.

248
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:25,799
I'm not talking to you.

249
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,860
You're doing it, aren't you?

250
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,900
I know that your mother was killed by a demon.

251
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,400
For years, you have been persistent in eradicating demons.

252
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,300
That's because I was young then. I couldn't protect her.

253
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,500
But now, I absolutely will not allow demons to do wrong in front of me.

254
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,200
But, Young Xiu, you want to eradicate demons,

255
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,400
but you always refuse to understand them.

256
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
Do you know that if you want to win, you must know yourself and your enemy?

257
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,000
Quibbling.

258
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,500
Later in the Yu Clan's turf, you must restrain your temper.

259
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,800
I know. I'm not an idiot.

260
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
Aren't you?

261
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,000
You!

262
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,700
Jinzhao.

263
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,900
If what Uncle Lin Yuan, no, what Lin Yuan said is true,

264
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,600
then I am the reason you lost your memory,

265
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Silly, haven't you also said

267
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,000
that his words might not be true?

268
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,900
Everyone, look! What is that?

269
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,900
   

270
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,800
Oh my, am I seeing this right?

271
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,400
A city floating in the sky!

272
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,100
You're right.

273
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,400
That is the Sea and Clear Skies,

274
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
our Yu Clan's home.

275
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll go call Xian Qing and Miss Ming.

276
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,700
Is this really my home?

277
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:58,599
It seems a bit desolate.

278
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Sea and Clear Skies was once the pearl of the sea.

279
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,600
But over a decade ago, it faced a great disaster

280
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
causing great harm to our clan.

281
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,900
Up to now, we have all been recuperating.

282
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,900
What kind of great disaster was it?

283
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,500
Young Lord, you will learn of it eventually.

284
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Hello.

285
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,500
Young Shifang, this is a ritual unique to the women of our clan.

286
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,800
But you're a man.

287
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,600
Is Miss Shuo Xuan also here?

288
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,500
I never knew you had a romantic side, Young Master Ju.

289
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,220
Young Shifang, so there's someone who you've got feelings for here.

290
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,600
When we get to the great hall, you will meet Her Lordship.

291
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
As well as Shuo Xuan. Please.

292
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,719
This is the entrance to Sea and Clear Skies. Everyone, follow me.

293
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
Miss Shuo Xuan.

294
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,920
It's been a while.

295
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,400
Your Lordship.

296
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,500
   

297
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,300
   

298
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,200
This is Zhu Yu, the Lord of Yu Clan.

299
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,300
What a familiar feeling.

300
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
Qi.

301
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,400
You are my mother?

302
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,400
It hurts?

303
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,800
Not anymore.

304
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,900
Qi, you are growing.

305
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,600
Young Lord, the bloodline of Kun flows within you.

306
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,300
Now that scales have begun to appear,

307
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,800
it indicates your mythical beast power has awakened.

308
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,300
Kun.

309
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,800
In the North Sea, there is a fish by the name of Kun.

310
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Are you really Qi's biological mother?

311
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
Qi is my own flesh and blood.

312
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,030
Then, am I...

313
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,200
truly Qi's life companion?

314
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Your Lordship, it is my fault for letting them know about the Companion Life Spell without your permission.

315
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,400
I will personally explain this later to the young lord and Young Yue.

316
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,900
This matter concerns the secrets of Sea and Clear Skies.

317
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,200
Please come this way.

318
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,300
All right.

319
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,400
Then we will take our leave.

320
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,700
Shuo Xuan, take them to the guest rooms.

321
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Follow me.

322
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,300
I don't believe what you said.

323
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,100
Is there any evidence?

324
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,800
Young Yue,

325
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,300
the resonance of your energy with the young lord's is the best proof.

326
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,890
And...

327
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,500
power resonance is mutual.

328
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,700
Previously, our young lord was young and lacked sufficient power,

329
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,000
so your power was activated to protect her.

330
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,800
 - Mindlink... 
 - Mindlink... 

331
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,100
 - arose from the Companion Life Spell? 
 - arose from the Companion Life Spell? 

332
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,100
Young Lord!

333
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
    
 Her Lordship knew you would return

334
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,600
and specially prepared a welcoming ceremony.

335
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,800
You've been away for three years.

336
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,200
Everyone is waiting to see you.

337
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,700
Qi, it's a joyous thing to find your family.

338
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Stay with your mother.

339
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,200
By Her Lordship's command, ensure the young lord is dressed up

340
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,000
before the welcoming ceremony.

341
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Why must I dress up like this?

342
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,600
Because you are to attend the welcoming ceremony.

343
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,800
I don't want to attend any ceremony.

344
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm going to find Jinzhao.

345
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,000
Are you referring to that young mortal?

346
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,559
Do you want him to be your future prince consort?

347
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,299
Prince consort?

348
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Your prince consort will be forever with you.

349
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,900
You will share happiness and suffering together.

350
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,500
I want Jinzhao to be my prince consort. I want to be with him forever.

351
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,600
It's just that I don't know if he wants to.

352
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,200
To my knowledge, nobody refuses to be a prince consort.

353
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,900
Really?

354
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,400
And it doesn't matter even if he doesn't want to.

355
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,900
In our territory, we will surely find a perfect prince consort for you.

356
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,800
No need. I only want Jinzhao.

357
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,600
Jinzhao. Jinzhao.

358
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,800
Jinzhao, would you like to be my prince consort?

359
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,200
Xi Luo says my prince consort can be with me forever

360
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,100
and that we'd share happiness and face hardships together.

361
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,400
If you'd like to be my prince consort, we'll be together forever.

362
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,600
Now we have money and status.

363
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,900
We can have ten eggs with a bowl of noodles.

364
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,400
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

365
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,679
Are you thinking about the Companion Life Spell?

366
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,100
It's all right. I'll be your life companion from now on.

367
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,200
I will protect you.

368
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,100
I just want to be with you as Yue Jinzhao.

369
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,300
Jinzhao, are you blaming me for making you lose your memory?

370
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,100
Of course not.

371
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,200
Back in the mine, my only thought

372
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
was to be with you forever.

373
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,900
But...

374
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Now I'm no longer certain.

375
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,900
Not certain about what?

376
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,599
Not certain...

377
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,600
whether my feelings for you are true

378
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,600
or just the result of the Companion Life Spell.

379
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,300
We're like blossoms side by side, connected but with separate roots.

380
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Are our feelings fake?

381
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,900
They are of course real.

382
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,800
♫  And into rainbows that worry and care  ♫

383
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,500
I need a moment.

384
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,200
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

385
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,500
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

386
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:46,700
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

387
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Your Lordship, the Qiyuan Sect's strongholds were successively destroyed.

388
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
I found it suspicious,

389
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,300
so I followed Ge Qingfei of the Hengdao Sect to Wuyan Village.

390
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,300
But unexpectedly, my identity was exposed by Yue Jinzhao and the others.

391
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,800
To guard the truth,

392
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,300
I had no choice but to falsely invent a spell called Companion Life.

393
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,700
Please punish me, My Lord.

394
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:14,400
It's all right. If not for this, I would not be able to see Qi again.

395
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,200
It's just that she mustn't know the truth yet.

396
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,300
It might be too much for her.

397
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:37,000


398
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

399
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,200
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

400
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,200
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

401
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,200
♫  It is destined to be  ♫

402
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,200
♫  My heart flutters silently  ♫

403
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,000

404
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,200
♫  Beginning with the moonlight  ♫

405
