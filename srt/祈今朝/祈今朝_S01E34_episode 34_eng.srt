1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:22,210


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,564
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,396
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:16,992
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,008
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

16
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,856
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

17
00:01:21,856 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,324
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

19
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:38,876
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,560
   

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,146
   

22
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,667
Master.

23
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,507
Shifang.

24
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:25,627
All common people who are suffering.

25
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:33,948
 The mouth of Pureness spring can foresee the future. 

26
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:39,502
 Whoever holds the Pureness key ring may catch a glimpse of the future. 

27
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:44,388
 If I could foresee the true weakness of Kun... 

28
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:57,428
Why can't I see anything?

29
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,407
Master.

30
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:05,027
Is it because I am not determined enough?

31
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,848
Master,

32
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,707
help me.

33
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:14,468
I have to see it.

34
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:16,294
 Xiu'er, to foresee the future, 

35
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:18,475
 Xiu'er, to foresee the future, 

36
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:22,888
 don't use your eyes, but feel it with your heart. 

37
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:33,148
 Master, your eyes 

38
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,408
 Master, your eyes 

39
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,808
  I understand now. 

40
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:40,807
 In order to protect the power of the spiritual vein, 

41
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,467
 Shennong sealed the Nine Springs. 

42
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:46,347
 The leakage of divine power is an accident. 

43
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,228
 Otherwise, even as a guardian, 

44
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,027
 if he wants to use the power of Pureness, 

45
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:54,247
 he has to pay the price. 

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,148
 Xiu'er, what do you think is the reason Pureness exists? 

47
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:01,987
Master.

48
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:07,428
It's a mockery from heaven,

49
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:11,207
making people think they can know the secrets of heaven.

50
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:16,327
But they find that they cannot escape from fate.

51
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:24,127
If I say so, would you be disappointed?

52
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,788
 Pureness and people. 

53
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:31,028
 I protect them because I want to. 

54
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:33,195
 Xiu'er, you are no longer a little girl. 

55
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:37,507
 Don't be swayed by others in your way to move forward. 

56
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:42,028
 Just ask yourself, and be true to your heart. 

57
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:48,587
That's really tough.

58
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:55,367
Master,

59
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,988
you once said,

60
00:04:56,988 --> 00:05:03,188
that you were glad to have the opportunity to be a guardian of Pureness,

61
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:06,867
who could guide the future in the direction you want,

62
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:10,095
and protect the people you wanted to.

63
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:13,028
Today,

64
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,848
I understand it now.

65
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:21,047
 Xiu'er, you have found your path. 

66
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,788
Way of Heaven.

67
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:36,688
Fate.

68
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:41,567
That power that thinks it can control everything.

69
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,808
At the cost of these eyes,

70
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:48,188
show me what I want to see.

71
00:06:48,188 --> 00:06:50,814
If they're not enough,

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,227
take my hands,

73
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:55,287
my legs,

74
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,468
and my life.

75
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,307
Alliance Leader Zuo, just surrender.

76
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,128
The Righteous Martial Alliance has been wiped out.

77
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:19,187
Righteous Martial Alliance fights for the common people.

78
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:24,387
Dying in battle today is also a way to fulfill my mission.

79
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:28,948
You are an opponent I respect.

80
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,507
Brothers, don't go far.

81
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:34,087
I'm coming.

82
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:10,687
General, Her Lordship and Lord Shuo Xuan will be here soon.

83
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,527
 Today, I... 

84
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:07,847
 bestow this sword upon you. 

85
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:13,848
 Having lived for decades, I have never misjudged a person. 

86
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:22,608
  From now on, I will mobilize all our disciples against Zhu Yu. 

87
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:27,727
Rest assured,

88
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:32,807
we'll handle the rest of it.

89
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:58,627
 Her Lordship! 

90
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:20,358
Bad news! Bad news!

91
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,345
What's wrong, Xiaoyuan?

92
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:24,845
Third Brother, Qi, and Luo Zhaoyan have gone to Buried Wind Plains.

93
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:30,988
I was careless.

94
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:35,249
I should have known they would never let a companion risk their lives alone.

95
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:40,638
Bring back Yue Jinzhao and Qi immediately. We can't lose them.

96
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,188
I'll go get them both.

97
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:43,788
I'll go, too.

98
00:12:43,788 --> 00:12:45,828
You two, be careful.

99
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,867
Don't worry.

100
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,428
Your Lordship.

101
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,927
Rehai has already moved here.

102
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:12,508
Shuo Xuan, open Rehai.

103
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,517
Yue Qi, you are the young lord of the Yu Clan.

104
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,783
Zhu Yu, stop.

105
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,403
I will find the perfect solution.

106
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,877
Zhu Yu.

107
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,477
Qi.

108
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,147
Shuo Xuan.

109
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,847
Hurry.

110
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:46,177
Zhaoyan, open Rehai.

111
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:04,588
 Yue Qi and Zhu Yu are bonded by blood. 

112
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:07,747
 Her blood is the key to removing the Bloodbinding. 

113
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,027
 Smudge the blood on Shuo Xuan and injure her 

114
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:14,627
 so that she enters the Core of the Demon Realm for treatment. 

115
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,547
 Yue Qi's blood and the power of Rehai 

116
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:23,270
 will remove the Bloodbinding between Zhu Yu and Mist Soul. 

117
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,667
 Zhu Yu's Vitality Energy will decrease rapidly 

118
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:32,348
 and that's your best chance to kill her. 

119
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:34,627
Mist Soul.

120
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,508
- Your Lordship. 
 - Your Lordship.

121
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,167
Your Lordship.

122
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,397
Your Lordship.

123
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,217
What's wrong, Your Lordship?

124
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,548
Mist Soul...

125
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:47,467
is releasing the Bloodbinding.

126
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,068
Your Lordship!

127
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:08,167
Yue Qi, it's you who did this.

128
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,068
Shuo Xuan, go protect Her Lordship.

129
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,068
Leave this to me.

130
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:33,557
You go after Zhu Yu. Leave this to us.

131
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,347
Let's go.

132
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,787
General Lin Yuan, long time no see.

133
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:44,147
Commander Ge.

134
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:48,668
We've been dealing with each other for years, but we had to end up at this point.

135
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,267
Second Sister, just beat them.

136
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,447
- Go. 
 - Catch them!

137
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,508
Ying Xuwei.

138
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:11,867
 I saw the weakness of Zhu Yu at Pureness. 

139
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:15,348
 The first one is three feet along the lateral line. 

140
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:44,148
 Second one is in the center of the dorsal fin. 

141
00:16:56,867 --> 00:17:00,928
 Third one is at two feet on the pectoral fin. 

142
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:39,367
 My daughter. 

143
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:44,567
 It is your blood that makes it difficult for me to blood bind the Mist Soul again. 

144
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:13,848
Your Lordship!

145
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:37,048
 Why do I have sudden palpitations? 

146
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:45,548
Report. Commander Ge is injured.

147
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,107
Keep an eye on the Kun.

148
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:55,607
Yes.

149
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,748
Since when have you been so selfless?

150
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:39,668
Having spent many years with you, I am naturally influenced.

151
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,468
Pretty good.

152
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:50,248
If Brother Hanjiang were here,

153
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:53,847
he'd be very pleased.

154
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:58,568
Of course.

155
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:31,497
Senior Uncle, you gave me your demonic power.

156
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:33,788
It's the punishment.

157
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:38,328
To be tainted by the demonic power you despise, are you mad?

158
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:44,708
Senior Uncle, thank you.

159
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:56,488
Qingfei. Qingfei.

160
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:00,048
Why is she so seriously injured?

161
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,298
Kun's scales fell down,

162
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:05,418
and we held them up, letting others go first.

163
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:09,585
And then, Second Sister and Lin Yuan pushed me away,

164
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:12,987
but she got trapped underneath.

165
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:16,084
I managed to dig them up.

166
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,645
Lin Yuan is already dead.

167
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,768
And Second Sister is also seriously injured.

168
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,547
Xiaoyuan.

169
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:29,117
- I'm here. 
 - I am okay.

170
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,787
Now hurry up...

171
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,967
Go...

172
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,407
Go monitor...

173
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,867
the situation of the Sea of Clear Skies.

174
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,568
But...

175
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,668
You go.

176
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:17,107
Young Lord.

177
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:19,827
Xi Luo, don't waste time.

178
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:23,607
Whoever wants to interfere with Her Lordship today has to die.

179
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,547
Go after Zhu Yu. I'll handle this.

180
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,147
Qi, let's go.

181
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,347
Zhaoyan.

182
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:41,207
Xian Qing.

183
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:59,515
Qi.

184
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:07,267
You shouldn't have come.

185
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:12,667
We come here with the hopes of many people.

186
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,507
No matter what, we will try our best.

187
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:20,388
In the face of ultimate power,

188
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:23,908
how is hope any different from despair?

189
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:28,308
As long as there's a glimmer of hope, there'll be a chance to survive.

190
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,547
Since we all just want to survive,

191
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,688
let's see who has the most skills to do so.

192
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,287
All right.

193
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:37,848
If that's the case,

194
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:42,211
then entrust your fates to your swords.

195
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:44,167
What is fate?

196
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,827
If you ask me, I am my own fate.

197
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:39,640
Qi.

198
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,167
Zhu Yu stimulated her inner strength and accelerated the transformation.

199
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,312
This is the best chance.

200
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:49,468
 Mother. 

201
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:52,488
Qi, hurry up!

202
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:59,107
Jinzhao.

203
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,495
Jinzhao, how are you?

204
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,927
I'm fine, let's go again.

205
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:07,128
Qi.

206
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:59,967
- Are you okay? 
 - I am okay.

207
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:28,528
No one can stop me.

208
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,207
Zhaoyan!

209
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:22,664
 The curse is gone, but I don't have much Vitality Energy left. 

210
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:49,608
Formation.

211
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,708
Jinzhao.

212
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,608
Zhaoyan.

213
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,787
Xian Qing, no!

214
00:31:39,787 --> 00:31:41,908
 Brother Hanjiang, 

215
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:44,553
 without your elixir, 

216
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:49,908
 I wonder what it's going to be like when I lose my thousand years of cultivation. 

217
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:04,718
 Zhaoyan, move aside. 

218
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:04,950


219
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:13,996
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

220
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:17,584
♫  If I were to trek through the river of memories, what would I pull up?  ♫

221
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:22,901
♫  Would it be the joy or penetrating sorrow from the years?  ♫

222
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:28,568
♫  What do I hear? The laughter running through the Milky Way  ♫

223
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:32,012
♫  What do I hear? The laughter running through the Milky Way  ♫

224
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:37,800
♫  My heart remembers who you are  ♫

225
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,019
♫  Grasping this short happiness over and over again  ♫

226
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,908
♫  Unable to ask you to stay with me  ♫

227
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:49,512
♫  The stories force me to sit with my regrets, to try and reconcile  ♫

228
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:54,139
♫  Why do my emotions still have to pull at my memories?  ♫

229
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,323
♫  I search for you, I draw closer to you  ♫

230
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:04,044
♫  Like the tide chasing you  ♫

231
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,728
♫  I asked fate to steal the answer to the riddle  ♫

232
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:11,340
♫  If I use this in exchange, could you not leave?  ♫

233
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,904
♫  I had you, yet lost you  ♫

234
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:18,914
♫  Only to redefine our reunion  ♫

235
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:24,900
♫  That is the puzzle our past life laid out for us  ♫

236
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:28,888
♫  Where are you, who stood by my side?  ♫

237
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,513
♫  Leave the sorrow that aches  ♫

238
00:34:34,513 --> 00:34:36,892
♫  Passing through the sea of people alone, after you left  ♫

239
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:38,196
♫  Arriving at the end of time  ♫

240
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:40,196
♫  That feeling of being at the end for a long time  ♫

241
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:41,859
♫  It's like the smile you left behind  ♫

242
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,512
♫  Lighting up my skies over and over again  ♫

243
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:46,612
♫  I open both hands and slowly become weightless  ♫

244
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:50,038
♫  Unable to hold on, I should let go  ♫

245
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:53,196
♫  Too afraid to ask, so I say I can bear it  ♫

246
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:56,812
♫  It's as if the story is complicated and you don't understand  ♫

247
00:34:56,812 --> 00:35:00,363
♫  We constantly turn and look back because we can't let go  ♫

248
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:03,846
♫  I search for you, I draw closer to you  ♫

249
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:07,468
♫  Like the tide chasing you  ♫

250
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:11,330
♫  I asked fate to steal the answer to the riddle  ♫

251
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,115
♫  If I use this in exchange, could you not leave?  ♫

252
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,672
♫  I had you, yet lost you  ♫

253
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:24,968
♫  Only to redefine our reunion again  ♫

254
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:28,408
♫  That is the puzzle our past life laid out for us (the puzzle)  ♫

255
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:32,299
♫  Where are you, who stood by my side?  ♫

256
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:37,336
♫  There are things I want to say, but my memories are fuzzy  ♫

257
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:41,004
♫  As if I'm broken, almost drowned by the loneliness  ♫

258
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:47,152
♫  Asking you, can I see you again?  ♫

259
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:51,687
♫  Wandering in the sea of people, who will stop when passing by?  ♫

260
00:35:51,687 --> 00:35:55,160
♫  I know that look in your eyes, firm and gentle (firm and gentle)  ♫

261
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,623
♫  Look at me, only look at me  ♫

262
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:09,611
♫  I meet you, I bid farewell to you  ♫

263
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:12,958
♫  Brushing past waving, without saying a word  ♫

264
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:16,863
♫  The longing hidden in my breath  ♫

265
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:20,297
♫  Gentle and tender as if it were you  ♫

266
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:24,273
♫  I miss you, I forgot you  ♫

267
00:36:24,273 --> 00:36:29,588
♫  Trying to calm the confused emotions  ♫

268
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:35,056
♫  Watching you walk towards me determinedly  ♫

269
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:40,600
♫  I hear you calling my name  ♫
