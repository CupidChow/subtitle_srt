1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Bai Ming.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bai Ming,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the Belly is in the temple.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When are we going to visit him?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can't wait?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm just thinking

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
if he's really Sheng Xuan,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can know

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
where the real master is.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I can also take the opportunity

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
to take Qiyuan Sect down.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No rush.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have to wait for this Doctor Bian

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
to make his move first.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The curse is getting more and more frequent.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you still going to keep your eyes on him?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll keep my eyes on him.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You'd rather

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
let me absorb all your life energy

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
than to take the curse?

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I...

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I won't.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Which one is better?

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You?

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiao Yue.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Where are the others?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They went to see Sister Mai Ming

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to ask about

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Doctor Bian's results.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Have some.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This crystal

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can sense the energy in it.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's very similar to Iron Wood.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But it seems to be different.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then can it help

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the bean bag upgrade

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
like Iron Wood?

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can put it

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
in the bean bag

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and test its power.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
See if it works

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
as well as Iron Wood.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If it works,

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
we'll have a new discovery.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can I go with you?

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the bean bag can show more expressions

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and actions.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I also think

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the bean bag's expression

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
seems to be too serious.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go now.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Which one should I take?

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This one or that one?

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xiao Yue.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's wrong?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm thinking

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
should I take the chicken leg

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or the rabbit's head?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Or

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
this one or that one?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It makes sense.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can you

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
let the bean bag speak?

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll try.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think it should work.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can it fire

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
while it's burning?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's still so shameless.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll help you.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Little dog.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So cute.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Poor dog.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It must have lost its fur

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because it didn't eat well.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Here.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Here.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Eat it.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Where did this dog come from?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Zhao Yan, please.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This dog will lose its fur.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Xiao Yue.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're going to see the bean bag.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll give you this one.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go, Zhao Yan.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's go.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let Luo play with it.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So cute.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It looks like Luo is playing with a dog.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It doesn't look like a normal dog.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It looks like a girl.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Master, Miss is looking for you.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Xiao Qin Zhao.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Senior, why are you here?

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Did you see that dog just now?

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
No.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Senior.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What happened to your hair?

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm old.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I just have some hair.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
By the way, Xiao Qin Zhao.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you going to do?

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm going to find the bean bag.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Senior, would you like to go with me?

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a pity.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm not interested in the bean bag.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're interested in the Luo family?

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you mean?

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Senior, you went down the mountain with Miss Ming.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But you stayed in the Luo family.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And let Miss Ming go alone.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And you care about Luo.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If you don't have any intention to go to the Luo family.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't believe it.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I don't want to investigate your plan.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But in the many secrets of the Luo family.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I think there will be something you want to know.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Since Xiao Qin Zhao sincerely invited me.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have no reason not to agree.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Thank you, Senior.

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's here.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There's a jade.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What happened?

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The big fish is going to hook.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How long did you wait here?

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I saw there was no guard at the door.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I guessed.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The Octagonal Tower is a forbidden place in the Luo family.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have to be punished to enter it.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Doctor Bian is best to explain everything.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
In case of trouble.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What do you want me to say?

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I want to know.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What do you want me to say?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I want to know.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What do you want me to say?

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
For example.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Doctor Bian's intention.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was invited by your master.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I came to pay a visit.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But I didn't expect to be invited to the palace.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm afraid that Doctor Bian is not invited to the palace.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's the initiative.

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know how you know.

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The relationship between the Luo family and the Jiuquan.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's just that the entrance of the Luo family.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not a small thing.

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So Doctor Bian deliberately exposed his identity.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let them enter the Luo family.

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Now, Doctor Bian has achieved his wish.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What do you think of the scenery of the Luo family?

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The scenery of the Luo family is indeed unique.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In the desert, it's like Jiangnan.

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Where does the Taoist priest absorb the life?

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And this painting.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's also very interesting.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It is said that when the great god of gods was born.

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are nine powers in the world.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The nine powers are all in one.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the most powerful spirit in the world.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The book of the spirit of heaven and earth.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's the most important life source.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The hot sea is the power of life.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The water source that the Luo family is based on.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The water source that the Luo family is based on.

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In fact, it's the hot sea.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And you.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You are the guardian of the hot sea.

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This grass butterfly.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's very similar to the grass god of the Lianluo Ring.

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is the color of the grass.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's so easy.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is the energy warehouse of Doubao.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you want to put it in?

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's done.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now this energy warehouse is not stable.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
After I adjust it.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It will definitely increase the power of Doubao.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Master, did you smell it?

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It smells so good.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It smells good.

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It smells so good.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It smells so good.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It smells so good.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It smells so good.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It smells so good.

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It smells so good.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's a little thirsty.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm so hungry.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
How about you?

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's so delicious.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What should I do?

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's written on it.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's kind of reviewed.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
From the ingredients,

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the Lianluo Ring,

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Le kannun,

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and the qian gui,

223
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
King-slaying dragon sozusagen and candelabra,

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and appreciative jiao nonsense.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,240
The day when blood befalls is 100% sure.

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,520
Your soul part is endeared for sure.

227
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,920
You could never survivors.

228
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,000
You must never leave Luo Family.

229
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,660
Blood f

230
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,560
a

231
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
person

232
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,000
Dr. Yan isn't narrows.

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Even the blood father knows it.

234
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
For more than two hundred years,

235
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,800
the twins of Luo family

236
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
are still alive for less than 20 to 30 years.

237
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,880
I think this is the curse of the Luo family.

238
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
In the village of Luo Ri,

239
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,160
I helped your master Luo to sell the wheat.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,120
The life force of the master Luo's body

241
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,280
was emptied out.

242
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,480
I think

243
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
the life force of the master Luo

244
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,160
was also absorbed by Miss Luo.

245
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,120
The life force of the master Luo

246
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
was also absorbed by Miss Luo.

247
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,400
It seems that Doctor Bian is also a master.

248
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
But in the Mirror of the Sea of the Sun,

249
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
no one can defeat me.

250
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,440
Miss Luo is so angry.

251
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,160
It seems that she cares about the master Luo very much.

252
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,800
Do you know how to get rid of the blood father?

253
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't know.

254
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
But someone knows.

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
Why should I believe you?

256
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
I think Miss Luo has been waiting for a long time.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,240
Now,

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,240
you only know to believe me.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Why is there no guard today?

260
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
They are all at the gate.

261
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,960
Let's go in and have a look.

262
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,440
Xiao Yue.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Xiao...

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,280
Xiao Yue.

265
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,400
How much did you drink?

266
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
Wake up. Wake up.

267
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,920
Xiao Yue.

268
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,840
Oh my god.

269
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,400
Let's go. Let's go.

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,400
Come on.

271
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,160
Since you want to let the hot sea return to the heaven,

272
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
you can come and get it.

273
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,120
But there is one thing

274
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
that concerns Miss Yue.

275
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
It's very interesting.

276
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Say it.

277
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,960
The matter of the nine power is very secretive.

278
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
I once searched for Miss Yue.

279
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
I found that she knew about the nine power.

280
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,520
And...

281
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
She said that her master taught her.

282
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,720
Miss Yue ate the Qi Yuan Pearl.

283
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,600
She was considered the master of the Qi Yuan Clan.

284
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,120
And you were suspected of being Sheng Xuan.

285
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,360
You even risked your life to poison her.

286
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,040
It seems that

287
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,080
you two are really close.

288
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,560
Are you

289
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,800
Miss Yue's master?

290
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,120
Since you are here,

291
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,880
please come up.

292
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,840
Where is Yingluo Huaren?

293
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,760
I don't know what you are talking about.

294
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,480
You broke into the forbidden area of Luo family.

295
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,080
Shouldn't you give me an explanation first?

296
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,840
Should Miss Luo explain to us first?

297
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,520
Miss Luo is a private person.

298
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,240
She is not a person who can explain to us.

299
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
She is a person who can explain to us.

300
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
She is a person who can explain to us.

301
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,040
She is a person who can explain to us.

302
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,760
Miss Luo is a private person.

303
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
She has seen the identity of the Qi.

304
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,480
This time, she met with the Qi Yuan Clan's Bian Luo Huan.

305
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
Who should explain to us?

306
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,960
What do you think the forbidden area of Luo family is?

307
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,480
You can come and go as you want.

308
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,760
Wan Bing.

309
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,520
Wan Bing.

310
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,600
Wan Bing.

311
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,440
They are both my friends.

312
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,120
Hold on.

313
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
He might be are a man.

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,600
How can she unfortunately

315
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,740
be chick mate with you by not being

316
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,800
Wan Bing.

317
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,360
I didn't expect you to take advantage of me.

318
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,280
Don't get hurt, Senior.

319
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,120
Don't worry.

320
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,160
I won't.

321
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,840
In your dreams,

322
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,040
can he hurt me?

323
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,120
Since it's the case,

324
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,560
I won't let you be my guests in the Luo family.

325
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,400
Zhao Yan,

326
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,640
you'll take your friends to the Luo family tomorrow.

327
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
You've been suspecting that

328
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,840
the Lurking Ring is the sacred ring of Qiyuan Sect.

329
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
You can take it to the Central Plains to the Five Alliance.

330
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,120
The Five Alliance has been fighting with Qiyuan Sect for years.

331
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm sure they'll give you an answer.

332
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,040
Yue, you're here.

333
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,280
Yue is drunk.

334
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,280
What?

335
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,800
I'll leave first.

336
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you have anything to ask before you're ready to leave?

337
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
And you're as始기는 as I heard.

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,320
That was a clever move.

339
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,600
Today you boarded the buyer considerately.

340
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,380
Hope you'S Skip theAgainst trucnarrator?

341
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,360
It's okay.

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,240
Nice to see you for the first time.

343
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,080
Senior Xian Qing.

344
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,400
Zhao Yan,

345
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,320
don't you

346
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,920
Miss Luo, you said that I look like a family member of yours.

347
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
Are you talking about Miss Luo?

348
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,920
What do you mean?

349
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,920
It's not a good thing that we look alike.

350
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
You two are not related by the same appearance.

351
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,120
You and your father are old friends.

352
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,320
And you owe me a favor.

353
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
How can I blame you?

354
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
You and your father are old friends?

355
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,520
We met a few decades ago.

356
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,720
We agreed to meet again in the future.

357
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,920
But he broke the deal.

358
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,720
I beg you.

359
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
I beg you.

360
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,320
Give me your medicine.

361
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,920
Let me save my daughter.

362
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,520
I beg you.

363
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
I beg you.

364
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,520
It's interesting.

365
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,520
But if I give you my waistband,

366
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
what will you exchange it for?

367
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
My life.

368
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,520
Exchange my daughter's life for my daughter's life.

369
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,320
I beg you.

370
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
I'll give you half of my magical power.

371
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
But you have to remember your promise.

372
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,920
Come to this place again three months later.

373
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,120
Let us break up.

374
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,920
It's a deal.

375
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,920
Xiao Zhao Yan really doesn't know about this.

376
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,920
My father said he had three months before he died.

377
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,720
But he died before the three months had passed.

378
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,120
The lonely man is gone.

379
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,920
The pain is too great.

380
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
I'm leaving.

381
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Xiao Zhao Yan.

382
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Your innocence is really useless

383
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,720
to us.

384
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,720
Lu Wang Ping's future memory

385
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,920
was destroyed.

386
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
That's great.

387
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
That's great.

388
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,520
The past is a joke.

389
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Luo Man Min also has my waistband.

390
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,320
But why do they have to exchange their identities?

391
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,120
Xiao Jin Zhao is right.

392
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,520
The Luo family has a lot of secrets.

393
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
It's really interesting.

394
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Go, Wei Vous.

395
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
He drank so much.

396
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
Are you okay?

397
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,920
What can I do?

398
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Your heartbeat is so fast.

399
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
You must be sick.

400
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
What are you doing?

401
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
You are so beautiful.

402
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
The End

403
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Yuanyuan's head,

404
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Dada's eyes,

405
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Doubao,

406
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
why did you change?

407
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
I'm not Doubao.

408
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Doubao, wait for me.

409
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
When I put on the gold thread,

410
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
you can burn.

411
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
If you call me Doubao again,

412
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I'll really burn.

413
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
It hurts so much.

414
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
What are you doing?

415
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Shi Fang,

416
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
you're wrong.

417
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
This stone is useless.

418
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Doubao is not his.

419
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Are you

420
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Miss Yue's master?

421
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Although Bian Luo Huan didn't answer,

422
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
this grass carp can't be a fake.

423
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
What if Bian Luo Huan

424
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
is really a strange master?

425
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Zhao Yan.

426
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
You're going out again?

427
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
It's almost the end of the Luo family.

428
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Don't forget it.

429
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
How could I forget such an important thing?

430
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
I prepared some western specialty.

431
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Take it on the way.

432
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Thank you.

433
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Zhao Yan,

434
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
when you come back,

435
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I have something important to tell you.

436
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
If you have something,

437
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
just tell me.

438
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Don't be polite.

439
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'll wait for you to come back.

440
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Okay.

441
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
I'll go first.

442
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
They're waiting for me.

443
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Have a safe trip.

444
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
I know.

445
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm leaving.

446
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
There's a teahouse ahead.

447
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Let's have a tea together

448
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
and have a rest.

449
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
It's far from here.

450
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
It's all grass carp.

451
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
It's much more comfortable than the desert.

452
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Qin Chang,

453
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
do you want to try this orange?

454
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
It's sweet and spicy.

455
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I don't want to eat it.

456
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
If you think it's sweet,

457
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
you can have some more.

458
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Miss Yue,

459
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
can you give it to me?

460
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Dr. Bian,

461
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
if you want to eat it,

462
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
I'll go to the carriage

463
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
and get it for you.

464
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Okay.

465
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
I'll go to the carriage

466
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
and get it for you.

467
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
Okay.

468
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
I'll go to the carriage

469
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
and get it for you.

470
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Okay.

471
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
I'll go to the carriage

472
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
and get it for you.

473
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll go to the carriage

474
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
and get it for you.

475
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
It's okay.

476
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
I'll just wrap it up.

477
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Jinzhe,

478
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
don't you want to eat it?

479
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
I want to eat it now.

480
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I can't.

481
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Brother Yue,

482
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
this orange

483
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
looks sour.

484
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Who said

485
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
it's sweet?

486
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
I'll settle for some projects.

487
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Okay.

488
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Nobody is drinking tea and resting.

489
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Pressure isございます.

490
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Madam...

491
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
What's this?

492
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,920
This is really a cultivating sect.

493
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,920
The Yunlan Stone and this paper crane are really amazing.

494
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
If you are interested,

495
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I will take you to see it next time.

496
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay, thank you.

497
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
Xiao Xiu has joined the Zhenwu Alliance.

498
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Zhenwu Alliance received a letter from the small stone room.

499
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Let him pick us up.

500
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,920
It should be close to the smoke.

501
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,920
Since Miss Ming is coming, let's set off early.

502
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
What's wrong?

503
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Like a bird flying to the sky

504
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
In the vast sea of people,

505
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Don't fall into the clouds

506
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I'm so worried about you

507
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
The end is hard to predict

508
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
If love is the most cruel

509
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,920
What should I do to stop

510
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I try my best not to hate you

511
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Build a track

512
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Even if the sky is broken, it's still like rain

513
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,920
It's my love that I'm spreading

514
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,920
The distance that I can't cross is destiny

515
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Senior

516
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Senior, you are cultivating for me.

517
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Remember to tell me in advance when it happens next time.

518
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
Sorry, senior.

519
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Thank you.

520
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Thank you.

521
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Do you have anything to say to me?

522
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Thank you for saving my life.

523
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
But it's just a little more.

524
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
You don't need to care.

525
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Just now, you were cultivating for me.

526
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Thank you.

527
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Why do you feel familiar with me when you are cultivating for me?
