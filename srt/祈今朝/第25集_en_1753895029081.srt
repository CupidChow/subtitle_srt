1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
보는

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,000
Everyone

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,760
Wen Wen

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,760
I don't want to leave regrets behind

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,760
I will give up my life for another chance

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,760
If I decide to take precautions

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,760
Who will I give my heart to?

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't want to fall asleep

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
I hope there will be no regrets in winter

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I don't want to leave regrets behind

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Because you are the iron body of the soul

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,760
So I pray for a miracle

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,760
Even if I'm burned by time

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I only wish to wake up for you

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I will find the miracle of eternity

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,760
I will never leave you

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
The Taoism Grandmaster

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Episode 16

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,760
The Taoism Grandmaster

22
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
The people in the red knife

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
It seems to have a bad intention to Xiao Yue

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
We will find him

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Is the third child settled?

26
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Xiao Yuan, you made a mistake again

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
I didn't

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,760
You think about the good intentions of the people every day

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,760
We are nothing to you

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
Xiao Yuan

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Xiao Yuan

32
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Go down and lock the ward

33
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Don't come out for three days

34
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Boss

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Xiao Yuan is still young

36
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
He doesn't know anything

37
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
How is the third child's injury?

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
How is the third child's injury?

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
The power of the sword is strong

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Xiao Huan is badly injured

41
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
I know

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Tomorrow is the day of the deal with Luo Manming

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
This is the most important

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
After the deal is completed

45
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Bring back Yue Jinchao

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I know

47
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
Qingfei

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Qingfei, what's wrong?

49
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
Blame me

50
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,760
If I had stopped Xiao Huan at that time

51
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
He wouldn't

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
This has nothing to do with you

53
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
That's his fate

54
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll go see the third

55
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Sang Wu

56
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Sang Wu

57
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Sang Wu

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Sang Wu

59
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
It's all my fault

60
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I didn't protect you

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
I didn't expect you to be so seriously injured

62
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
Come here

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,160
Our little-tongue-junior

64
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,760
Why are you crying?

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Don't worry

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Sang Wu

67
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,760
He'll be better after a while

68
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Really?

69
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Of course.

70
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
Your third brother is a doctor.

71
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,720
I know my own body.

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,760
Then you should have a good rest.

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Isn't the boss blaming you for the ban?

74
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
You sneaked out.

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,440
Aren't you afraid that he'll punish you?

76
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,760
I just want to come and see you.

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
You're a bad guy.

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
Third brother, I'll come and see you next time.

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
Run.

80
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Boss.

81
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm sorry, your mom.

82
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Boss.

83
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,320
to me.

84
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,160
I didn't expect

85
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
that Qi's craftsmanship

86
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
can break through my co-signature.

87
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,240
That's great.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Just think about

89
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,680
my art while I'm at it.

90
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,800
Niu Sher和 Потому in that case,

91
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,800
you did blame yourself for this.

92
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,880
That you were the原因 of her death.

93
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,840
What's more,

94
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
that 90% of the critical votes

95
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,760
are on her.

96
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,280
Probably,

97
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,140
she will not be able to

98
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,320
be in that situation from now.

99
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,820
This is the age of her life.

100
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,680
If today,

101
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,820
the 신맩断

102
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,580
's possibility

103
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
is more distorted than her,

104
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
it doesn't mean wanton,

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
who did this to her.

106
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,280
But it's the same as what we've been through.

107
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,940
Huotu.

108
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,160
Come.

109
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,800
Let me spoiler it for you.

110
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,920
No.

111
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,560
You're sorry,

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,480
then.

113
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
Brother As wavelength to live.

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,880
In the third.

115
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,520
Sorry.

116
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,780
teaching

117
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,100
Mr. Qian up.

118
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,840
Okay.

119
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,420
Your boss.

120
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,040
The shooting star that broke through the sky

121
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Burned the past

122
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Forgotten the name

123
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,040
The magic behind the mask

124
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Only through my eyes

125
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Who can see

126
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,040
It's destined to be me for you

127
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Even if the ending is hard to tell

128
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Unwilling to exchange a little bit of history

129
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Leave a silent description to love

130
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Please pay attention

131
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Need to have your heart

132
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You rest well

133
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Jinzhen

134
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,040
It's destined to be me for you

135
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Jinzhen

136
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Even if the ending is hard to tell

137
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Unwilling to exchange a little bit of history

138
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Leave a silent description to love

139
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,040
It's destined to be me for you

140
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Even if the ending is hard to tell

141
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Unwilling to exchange a little bit of history

142
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Leave a silent description to love

143
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Brother Luo

144
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,040
What a beautiful scene

145
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,040
It's a pity that it will be gone after a while

146
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Thanks to you

147
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
You seem to be impatient

148
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
You care about me

149
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Of course not

150
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
It's going to change

151
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
It's going to change

152
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
This day

153
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Wind and rain are coming

154
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Why hasn't dad come back yet

155
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
I'll go pick him up

156
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Why does it look so much like Zhao Yan

157
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Which room is this

158
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
Back then

159
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,040
They were here to set my blood on the hot sea

160
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Back then I still laughed and walked into this stage

161
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
I remember that

162
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
I'm the only one left

163
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
To exchange for peace

164
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
How great is that

165
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
It's a pity

166
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
I only found out after I died

167
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
My soul and the heat were both attached to the Luo family

168
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
After a few decades

169
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
The Luo family gave birth to a pair of twins

170
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,040
My soul was born in one of them

171
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,040
The life force of each person has been leaving me

172
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
But we were destined to be cursed

173
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Since then

174
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,040
I have been using the life of twins to get reborn

175
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,040
My immortality and the early death of the Luo family

176
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Is also a curse from the Heaven

177
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
As a guardian of the hot sea

178
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I stick to my own path

179
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Now only the sea is left

180
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
The hot sea

181
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Is the way to the lost and lost

182
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Master

183
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Zhao Yan

184
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Why didn't you stop him

185
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Cao Feng

186
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
I'm going to welcome the master

187
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Be sure to ensure the safety of the family

188
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Yes

189
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Zhao Yan

190
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
You're back

191
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Did you tell Heng Daozhong about our news of going to Mao Wan Village

192
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Why did you do this, Bai Ming

193
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Do you still believe me

194
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
I believe you

195
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
It's a long story

196
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Why are you cooperating with the Bailong Huan

197
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm not interested

198
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
You are Zhao Yan's brother

199
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I don't want to make it difficult for you

200
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
I just want to know something

201
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Tell me everything you know

202
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Mr. Luo

203
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
It's like the magic of the Qimen Dun family

204
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Bai Ming, what are you doing

205
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,040
I want to realize my own destiny

206
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Destiny

207
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
You want to break the hot sea

208
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
You found a way

209
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Is it because of this numbness

210
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
I've been trapped here for more than two hundred years

211
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Finally found a way to escape

212
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
How could I miss

213
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Zhao Yan

214
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Bai Ming

215
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Bai Ming

216
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Is there a way to break this formation

217
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
There must be a flaw in the secret formation

218
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Fault

219
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Let's go find the fault

220
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,040
The name of our Luo family in the west is so small in the west

221
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,040
We are also a big family in the central plains

222
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Yes

223
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
This is all the credit of the Luo family

224
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
The master has a good family

225
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
The bandits are light and evil

226
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Guard the peace of the people

227
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
The Luo family is not far away

228
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Yes

229
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Drink again

230
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Come come

231
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Who is on the card

232
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Who is on the card

233
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
You just got married and you don't know

234
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,040
The key to the Octa Tower is only the master

235
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
And this is our master Luo Zhao Yan

236
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
The master is on the tower

237
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
The ceremony should be about to start

238
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Let's go under the tower

239
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Ok, let's go together

240
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Go

241
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Go

242
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Go

243
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Go

244
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Go

245
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
What is this

246
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
What is this

247
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
What is this

248
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:28,800
Hey

249
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Woman.

250
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,220
Father.

251
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,440
When did you come back?

252
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,080
Misses are arriving soon.

253
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,120
The traditions and matters eventually fall onto my shoulders.

254
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm a trusted man of the family.

255
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
The silver ingot has been in a bad shape these days.

256
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
I've been busy with the business.

257
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,120
So I'm a little bit delayed.

258
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,600
Then let's go.

259
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,560
I'll get it.

260
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,480
Murder!

261
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,240
Father!

262
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,120
Open the door!

263
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,360
What's going on?

264
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,200
What happened?

265
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,280
There are many people who killed

266
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,360
in the manor.

267
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,560
Do you think you can escape?

268
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Zhao... Zhao Yan?

269
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,400
Father, he won't do it.

270
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll go and have a look.

271
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,560
Me too.

272
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,680
No.

273
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,240
You stay here and listen to me.

274
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,360
It's weird.

275
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,880
I'm also losing my power.

276
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm weakening.

277
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,240
Zhao Yan.

278
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,520
No.

279
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,840
What's wrong?

280
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,760
No.

281
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Let's brush your hair first.

282
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,320
Brother.

283
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,240
What is this?

284
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Transcendence?

285
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,920
Where did Zhenshan always last

286
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,960
come back to sleep.

287
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
It seems that she didn't have time to get poppy focus.

288
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,720
What's wrong with this?

289
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,580
Take it.

290
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,340
Wait.

291
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,300
The rope broke.

292
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,860
Are you okay?

293
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm fine.

294
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,500
Zhang Baibing.

295
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,900
Pass over the gr tenant.

296
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,460
Just pass over the gr tenant.

297
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,580
Baibing.

298
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,100
Baibing!

299
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,440
Who are you?

300
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,260
Baibing.

301
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,380
Who are you?

302
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,660
You are...

303
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,500
The bribe.

304
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
The bribe.

305
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
It will go down.

306
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
The bribe.

307
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,260
Be careful.

308
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,180
Zhao Yan.

309
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,420
Qianqian, keep an eye on Zhao Yan.

310
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,580
I'll go find Luo Manming.

311
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,540
Subject Liang!

312
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,920
Xiao Seems to be간

313
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,120
the deceased!

314
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,240
decorative!

315
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,040
Suddenly

316
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,120
he runs away.

317
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Master...

318
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,000
Stop there!

319
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,460
Zhao Yan.

320
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,700
Zhao Yan.

321
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,180
Are you okay?

322
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,300
That hairpin

323
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,740
is absorbing Zhao Yan's life energy.

324
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,460
Master.

325
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,380
Zhao Yan.

326
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,780
How is he?

327
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,260
Master is still alive.

328
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
It's been over 200 years.

329
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
Over 200 years.

330
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,500
Here.

331
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,580
Mr. Zhao.

332
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,260
We found that

333
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,500
Jia Neng's body specialist

334
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,700
used the dance twelve.

335
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,820
You found out?

336
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,420
exist awaiting imply

337
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,700
of dead,

338
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,720
he used the drink

339
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
this statistics

340
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,940
is facing wrong.

341
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,480
What's that?

342
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,020
This is the

343
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,940
sign of his life.

344
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

345
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Xian Jin.

346
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
Zhao Yan.

347
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Come.

348
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

349
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

350
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

351
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

352
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

353
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

354
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

355
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

356
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

357
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

358
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

359
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

360
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

361
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

362
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

363
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

364
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

365
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

366
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
The needle is slowly disappearing.

367
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,100
How is he?

368
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,180
Lord.

369
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,860
Open up.

370
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,220
samples can be liven up but can hold one person's sword.

371
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,220
Did not you know that your director is crazy?

372
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,620
I'll do it myself.

373
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,140
Is this all a près

374
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,300
I forget my carries

375
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,760
But it would cost me my pride

376
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:16,840
You are the red

377
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
and finally destroyed the Luo family.

378
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Shi'an,

379
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
you did it.

380
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,920
You want to kill me?

381
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,040
You killed so many innocent people.

382
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,080
You must pay for it.

383
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
Innocent?

384
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
I just took back everything the Luo family owes me.

385
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,320
They are just ordinary people who know nothing.

386
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,560
So many lives.

387
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,000
You must give them justice.

388
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Can you really do it?

389
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Chaoyan,

390
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
compared to you,

391
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
what are their lives?

392
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Compared to me?

393
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,640
You are using the lives of the whole clan to exchange for me.

394
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
I never thought of hurting you.

395
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
I will pay you back for the past,

396
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,640
the ink and the flowers.

397
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I will be buried in your grave.

398
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,640
I will be buried in your grave.

399
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Don't be afraid.

400
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Don't be afraid.

401
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I will be buried in your grave.

402
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
I will be buried in your grave.

403
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,640
I will be buried in your grave.

404
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I will be buried in your grave.

405
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
I will be buried in your grave.

406
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,640
When I learned about the law of the brother-in-law,

407
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,640
the Luo family was destined to end like this.

408
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
You shouldn't have hurt him.

409
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
I shouldn't have.

410
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Since brother-in-law has been released,

411
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Mr. Luo,

412
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,640
come with us.

413
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Are you coming or not?

414
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
I will go after them.

415
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
To remove the blood,

416
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
we need to use the blood of the Qing clan.

417
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
The more blood we use,

418
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
the more blood we will use.

419
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
I will go after them.

420
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
I will go after them.

421
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
I will go after them.

422
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
I will go after them.

423
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
The blood of the Qing clan,

424
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
the more blood we use, the more effective it is.

425
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,640
If you don't want to use the blood of the Qing clan,

426
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
you can use the blood of the whole clan.

427
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
The Shen Yi clan

428
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
only protects the people of Yi.

429
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
They are the most heartless

430
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
and affectionate people.

431
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Do you know

432
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
if you force yourself to get rid of the curse,

433
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
you can only live for three days.

434
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,640
And you can never regret it.

435
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
It doesn't matter.

436
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
I have got what I want most.

437
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
Don't worry.

438
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I will go after them.

439
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
I will go after them.

440
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I will go after them.

441
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
I will go after them.

442
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
I will go after them.

443
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
I will go after them.

444
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
I will go after them.

445
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
I will go after them.

446
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I will go after them.

447
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I will go after them.

448
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
I will go after them.

449
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I will go after them.

450
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I will go after them.

451
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I will go after them.

452
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,640
I will go after them.

453
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
I will go after them.

454
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
I will go after them.

455
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
I will go after them.

456
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
I will go after them.

457
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
I will go after them.

458
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,640
The shooting star that breaks through the sky

459
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,640
burns the past

460
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,640
and forgets the name of the heart.

461
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,800
The beauty behind the mask

462
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,800
Only through my eyes

463
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Who can see

464
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,800
It's destined to be me for you

465
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,960
I'm afraid the ending will be hard to escape

466
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I don't want to exchange a little bit of light

467
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Leave the unspoken promise to love

468
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm afraid the ending will be hard to escape

469
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Looks like a random path

470
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,960
Burn marks

471
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Hiding secrets

472
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:24,120
The plot of the unspoken promise

473
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,120
It's all my little heart

474
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Arrangement

475
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:38,120
It's destined to be me for you

476
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I'm afraid the ending will be hard to escape

477
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I don't want to exchange a little bit of light

478
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Leave the unspoken promise to love

479
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,440
The unspoken promise

480
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:14,440
It's destined to be me for you

481
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Even if I try, I may fail

482
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I deliberately miss you for the rest of my life

483
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Leave the evidence of love
