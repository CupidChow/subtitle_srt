00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,880
Translation by Hua Chenyu

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,600
I'll tear up all the memories of the past

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
and leave no regrets behind

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,600
I'll give up my whole life for a change

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
If I decide to lower my guard

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,600
who will I give my heart to?

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of being broken

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,720
I'm not afraid of falling asleep

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,720
I have no regrets even if I'm in the middle of the winter

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,720
I have no regrets even if I'm on a different path

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:21,320
Because you are the secret of the

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
The miracle of searching for the eternal

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I will never give up on my path

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,320
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Episode 16

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Hao Wei, the boss has been waiting for you for a long time.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Don't you want to know your own background?

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Then come with me.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Boss.

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
You have been planning your plan for so long.

22
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Now you can tell us the truth.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Brother Chen, all this

24
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
is because of you.

25
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Brother Chen, all this

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
has to start with Zhu Yu.

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Zhu Yu is a father of blood and a father of soul.

30
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
We collect a lot of life energy

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,320
to give him a rare and healing fish.

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
But in the Long Ballad

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
there are still some dark emotions

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,320
that were brought before the death of the human race.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,320
These were all eaten by Zhu Yu

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
and caused him to die day by day.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
If one day the situation is completely out of control

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320
then the six realms will be destroyed.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
So we reached an agreement with Zhu Yu.

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Once the situation is out of control

41
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
we can kill him.

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,320
But the only person who can kill Zhu Yu

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,320
is the child he created with his own blood.

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Zhu Yu,

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,320
give the child his name.

46
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Qi.

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Brother, what did I say?

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
This is your family.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
This is your family.

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
This is the truth

51
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,320
that you have been wanting to know.

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
What about Jinzhao?

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,320
What does this have to do with him?

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Three years ago

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
someone told me for the first time

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
about the existence of Yue Jinzhao.

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Boss, can I discuss something with you?

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
I don't want to hear it.

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I haven't said anything yet.

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Which time didn't you come to me for Qi?

61
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Boss, look.

62
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Qi has been in the jade bane for more than ten years.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
He has been here for more than ten years.

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,320
He has already known every ant here.

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Just one day.

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
I'll take him to the human world

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
and come back the next day, okay?

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll come back to you next time.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Stop!

70
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Take him away.

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Boss.

72
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Third Brother?

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
You are not Third Brother.

74
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,320
You just didn't wear this dress.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Who are you?

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
I am Xiao Huan.

77
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,320
You actually drugged me.

78
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Boss, I'm sorry.

79
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
But I am indeed Xiao Huan.

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
It's just that

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
I am Xiao Huan three years later.

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Then why did you appear here?

83
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
What I'm going to tell you next

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
you definitely can't believe.

85
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
But because I'm the one who killed you.

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,320
I definitely can't believe.

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
But it's okay.

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Time will slowly verify all of this.

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Three years later,

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
I was seriously injured.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I can't bear Qi's co-incidence.

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I can't deal with the jade together with him.

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,320
To complete the mission.

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
So I came from the Martial Soul.

95
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm going to the dragon pond to exchange for a new life.

96
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Leave him in this time.

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Qi's co-incidence with me.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
To restart the mission of killing Chu Yu.

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I've erased his memory.

100
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I'm going to send him to the human world.

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Let him wake up from the Wuyuan Village.

102
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,320
And the one who wakes up with him.

103
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
There is another person.

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Another person? What about you?

105
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,320
He is the one I'm going to exchange from the dragon pond.

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,320
He is...

107
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Yue Jinzhao.

108
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Yue Jinzhao.

109
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,320
His co-incidence will be far beyond me.

110
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
They will travel to the human world for three years.

111
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Until they have the power to kill Chu Yu.

112
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't believe it.

113
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I didn't believe it either.

114
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I don't believe it either.

115
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I don't believe it either.

116
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,120
Three years ago,

119
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
Boss told me that

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Qi Bei had been stolen.

121
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Someone called Yue Qing Zhao

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,200
would be there to accompany him.

123
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,160
I didn't believe it no matter what.

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
Until I went to the Mou Yan Village

125
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,320
and saw you with my own eyes.

126
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Boss,

127
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
I was in a hurry to find Qi.

128
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,280
Don't joke with me.

129
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
Yes, Boss.

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,040
Did you see it wrong?

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,160
Qi.

132
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,280
Qi.

133
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,840
รณ

134
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Take them there first.

135
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Hmm.

136
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,520
After the inspection,

137
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,440
we found that you could

138
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,320
be with Qi Gongming.

139
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,080
And

140
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
Gongming surpassed me.

141
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,880
So Boss made a decision

142
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,400
to let you complete the mission

143
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
for Qi Gongming and me.

144
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,200
We told Zhu Yu about it.

145
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,120
He agreed to send you two

146
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,920
back to the mortal world

147
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
and live for a while.

148
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,640
So we brought you back

149
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,560
to the Wuyuan Village.

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,120
I'll protect you

151
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,600
and keep you company.

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
Three years later,

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,400
I was seriously injured.

154
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,680
The words that he said to Boss

155
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
are now being tested.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,680
I can't revive.

157
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
I can only exchange.

158
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,200
I'll use the existence of the Wuyuan.

159
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,080
Then I can create

160
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,480
the life that the Wuyuan wants.

161
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
There is a fixed number of heaven and earth.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
It can't be increased.

163
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,440
If you want to,

164
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,080
you can only use the life of the Wuyuan

165
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,960
and all the memories

166
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,760
related to the Wuyuan.

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,360
Then you can repeat the life

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
that the Wuyuan wants.

169
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Isn't it a life for a life?

170
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,080
And after the exchange,

171
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,360
the Wuyuan

172
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
has completely disappeared.

173
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,160
The place of error will be corrected by the heaven and earth.

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,160
The traces of the Wuyuan

175
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
will naturally be covered by others.

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,040
So it means

177
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
what that person did

178
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
will be done by others.

179
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,560
And

180
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
no one will feel it's wrong.

181
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,160
Exactly.

182
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,920
Miss Ming,

183
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,080
you can't exchange.

184
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
If you exchange the life of Mr. Gu,

185
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,280
there will be no Mingxiu in the world.

186
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,760
Sister Mingxiu,

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,040
even the traces you have been through

188
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,000
will be gone.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,640
I have been suspecting you

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
that you deliberately set me and Qi

191
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,080
up and even tried to lure him

192
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,840
to use the Qi Yuan Bead to become stronger.

193
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
I don't understand why you did that.

194
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,400
Now...

195
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,040
Now I understand.

196
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
It turns out that Qi and I

197
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,200
are only there because we are all carrying the burden.

198
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,640
Qi

199
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,040
took the Qi Yuan Bead from the Fujing Hall.

200
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
It was an accident.

201
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,160
I was the one who did the talk.

202
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,600
It has nothing to do with the third person.

203
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
You deliberately set up this.

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,640
You did all this

205
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
to make me and Jingzhao

206
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,960
kill Zhu Yu.

207
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
If the situation

208
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,960
is not so bad,

209
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,280
we wouldn't do that.

210
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,120
Now,

211
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,440
there are rumors everywhere.

212
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
It means that Zhu Yu

213
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,240
is in the Qi Yuan Bead

214
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,560
and the West Stone.

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,640
It means that Zhu Yu's body

216
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,960
is completely out of control.

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,800
Did you see my Ge'er?

218
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,280
It must be your family

219
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,360
who did this secretly.

220
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,520
Otherwise,

221
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,800
Uncle Nian would have treated him

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,720
well.

223
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
How could he have become

224
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
a stone man suddenly a few days ago?

225
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,760
So,

226
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,080
all the time,

227
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
all the rumors

228
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
are about Zhu Yu.

229
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,080
If we don't kill Zhu Yu,

230
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,200
the whole world

231
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,160
will be in danger.

232
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,160
ุงุตู

233
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,760
Yue,

234
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Miss Yue,

235
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
was the person who tried to upset you

236
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
lying to you molecule8?

237
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,680
That's impossible.

238
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
Ning Xuewei said

239
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,040
he would go to the Sea of Heaven Cure with him tomorrow

240
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,160
and test it SAS

241
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,080
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Did you travel back three years

243
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,960
from Martial Soul?

244
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,120
Yes.

245
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,680
I just remembered

246
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,880
that the burglars have collected

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,040
information about the Nine Spring.

248
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,160
There's a record in a book

249
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,520
that the Martial Soul can take control of time.

250
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
People can really

251
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,800
return to the past through Martial Soul.

252
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,600
Xiaojun, Zhao Xiaoyue.

253
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,720
Let's go to the Sky Kingdom

254
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,000
with you tomorrow.

255
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,000
Xianqing is right.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
We'll face it together.

257
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you.

258
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,000
Jinzhao.

259
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,720
Miss Yue.

260
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,840
Yue Xiong has to

261
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,200
take over

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,760
these things.

263
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Xiaoyue.

264
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,560
Have an early rest.

265
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,200
Miss Yue.

266
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm fine.

267
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,760
I'll go to see Miss Ming.

268
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
It turns out that...

269
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,120
A'jian.

270
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm weak.

271
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
You're weak and you still drink?

272
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,360
I'd like to drink some.

273
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,360
That day,

274
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
you took him to Bai Chi Fist.

275
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,720
I thought

276
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,760
you wanted him to remember your kindness.

277
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,600
I didn't expect

278
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,760
he would be so cold to you.

279
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
I couldn't help

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,200
but tell him what you did.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,640
Xiao Hua.

282
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
I was the one who did it.

284
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,240
It's okay.

285
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,520
You know what happened, right?

286
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Why?

287
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,960
What do you mean?

288
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
Don't play dumb.

289
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,000
I know

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
you didn't want to make up with him.

291
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,360
You wanted him to hate you.

292
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
You're really a second-class man.

293
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,400
You finally know.

294
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,680
Xiao Hua.

295
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
Why?

296
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
If he doesn't love me,

297
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
I'd rather

298
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,120
hate him

299
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040
than forget about my feelings.

300
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,120
Xiao Hua.

301
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't stay here alone.

302
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,520
I'll be worried about you.

303
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Qing.

304
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,320
To be honest,

305
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,280
I don't know how to face you.

306
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
It rains.

307
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
The past is lost.

308
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't care about you.

309
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,640
I want to forget but I'm more clear.

310
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
That's how you face it.

311
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,240
The world is spinning.

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,200
People are still saying goodbye.

313
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,480
We want to end it.

314
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,160
If what Heng Daozhong said is true,

315
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,040
as long as our resonance is still there,

316
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll be the one

317
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,960
who controls you.

318
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
Even if I'm a murder weapon,

319
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,240
you're the only one

320
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,200
who can control me.

321
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,440
I hate being regarded as a murder weapon.

322
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,080
I'll go back first this time.

323
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,280
But I'm willing to let you be my only Sword Holder.

324
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,000
I can't get rid of the regret and miss.

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,720
Qing.

326
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,560
I don't want you to have such a fate.

327
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,080
The sword is sharp and the heart is far.

328
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
The strange words

329
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,040
are left for me by time.

330
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,520
They're at the intersection.

331
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,720
At the crossroads ofWei.

332
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
Jinzhao, let's run.

333
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Qing!

334
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh no!

335
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
Qi Hai and Yue Jinzhao are coming.

336
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
Run!

337
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
You let them go?

338
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,320
Yes.

339
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,760
I sealed the guards in advance.

340
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't stop them.

341
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,120
replace

342
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,560
Brother, you may leave.

343
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,920
OK, brother.

344
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,120
I'll Cherish you

345
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,520
and finish you off.

346
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,080
Now,

347
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
we'll go together.

348
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,080
Hailu!

349
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
Wait, let me.

350
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Wait for me to come.

351
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,040
Go.

352
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,680
Let's go.

353
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,880
Go.

354
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,840
Hey, D rail.

355
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,720
We are already in the gate.

356
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
Hold your nose when you want to be afraid.

357
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Friends are still in the pre-emptive.

358
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
They will never give up.

359
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Boss,

360
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
only half a day left.

361
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
It's better this way.

362
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Qi,

363
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
don't be nervous.

364
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
This is the last thing I can do for you.

365
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
I didn't expect

366
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Jinzhao and Xiao Yue's identities to be so different.

367
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
When Miss Yue asked me to meet Yun Lai,

368
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
he should have left the jade tree with Mr. Yue.

369
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I hope they can go further and further.

370
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
This responsibility is so heavy.

371
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
It shouldn't be only them two to face it.

372
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Are you worried that

373
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Heng Daozhong will take us as hostage?

374
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
No, no, no.

375
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
No.

376
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
If Heng Daozhong really dares to do this,

377
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
we will fight him.

378
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm afraid those two silly kids

379
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,880
won't give us the chance to be hostage.

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

381
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
I was thinking about my background.

382
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
It turns out

383
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
my background is to keep the people safe.

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
That's why I need to be more nervous.

385
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
This person has just appeared in the world.

386
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,880
But such a big responsibility,

387
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
can I afford it?

388
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Has anyone asked me about my opinion?

389
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
You regret finding your background?

390
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Yes.

391
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
If we stayed in Wuyan Village

392
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,880
and lived our own lives peacefully,

393
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
although it's peaceful,

394
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
we can be at ease

395
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
like ordinary people.

396
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
But then,

397
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
we won't go to the Silver Treasure.

398
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
We won't meet so many good friends.

399
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
We won't have so many precious experiences.

400
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
We need to think about the good things.

401
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Jinzhao, look.

402
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
We're in Jing'an.

403
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Let's go to Jing'an and play.

404
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Jing'an, Jing'an.

405
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Look, it's so beautiful.

406
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
Go ahead.

407
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Jinzhao.

408
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Jinzhao, let's let go of all our worries

409
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
and play happily today.

410
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Okay.

411
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Jinzhao, let's go.

412
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Come on.

413
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Is it sweet?

414
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Stop.

415
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Do you want to vote?

416
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,880
Come on.

417
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
Come on.

418
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
It's so good to be a child.

419
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
No worries.

420
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
No worries.

421
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
No worries.

422
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Yes.

423
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,880
Even if the sky falls down,

424
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
we have our own high standards.

425
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Come on.

426
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Do you want to write something?

427
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Let me see.

428
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,880
Jinzhao,

429
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
people always make wishes to the invisible immortal.

430
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Does it really work?

431
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Maybe they're not praying to the immortal,

432
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
but praying to the heaven and earth.

433
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Praying to the heaven and earth?

434
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
The grace and rain of the heaven and earth

435
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
nourished all beings.

436
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
They should be trying to

437
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
ask for the blessing of the heaven and earth.

438
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Then I think

439
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
people should pray to themselves.

440
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Even if there is rain and rain in the heaven and earth,

441
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
it should be done by people

442
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
to grow the fruit.

443
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
Yes.

444
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
You're right.

445
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,880
We should pray to ourselves.

446
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Fang, look.

447
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

448
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Yes.

449
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
Come on.

450
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Let me show you around.

451
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Okay.

452
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Uncle Ji, Aunt Ji.

453
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
Young Master Yue, Young Lady Yue.

454
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
This is the young lady

455
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
I told you about

456
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
when you mistook me for Zhuo'er.

457
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm so sorry, young lady.

458
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
I was so confused.

459
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
I've troubled you.

460
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
No trouble at all.

461
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Didn't you also treat me

462
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
to delicious tofu?

463
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Uncle Ji,

464
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
is Aunt Ji in full moon?

465
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
That child is pregnant.

466
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Since we had our own child,

467
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Yao Fang has become normal.

468
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Do you want to touch it?

469
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
Can I listen to it?

470
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Why can't I hear anything?

471
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
The child is still young.

472
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
Of course you can't hear it.

473
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,880
But every time he breathes,

474
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
every time he beats,

475
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I can feel it clearly.

476
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
In fact,

477
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
in the most glorious trouble,

478
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
I won't miss a single sound.

479
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
I often remember

480
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
when you were

481
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,880
in my body.

482
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
You were in my body.

483
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
I was so worried about

484
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
such a small life.

485
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
My heartbeat

486
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
was louder

487
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
than any other sound in the world.

488
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
My mother

489
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
also told me that.

490
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
She must love you very much.

491
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Jinzhao,

492
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
do you know what I'm thinking?

493
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
I want to make the child

494
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
in Aunt Ji's womb

495
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
born in peace.

496
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Jing'an is so lively.

497
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
I hope everyone can

498
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
live in peace.

499
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
I want to protect everything.

500
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I want to protect everyone.

501
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Qin,

502
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
let's go back to the jade world.

503
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I've thought it over.

504
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Even if it's the first time,

505
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
I'll take you to see the Wuyuan Village

506
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
and take this road.

507
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
Jinzhao,

508
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
I was born in the jade world.

509
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
I have no parents.

510
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
When I grew up in this world,

511
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I think

512
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
I also want to

513
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
take a step into this world.

514
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
I will try to think of

515
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
a way to do both.

516
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Protect the jade and the world.

517
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
Protect the world.

518
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I know.

519
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,880
I believe you.

520
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Little jade jade pendant.

521
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
I'll put it on for you.

522
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Okay.

523
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
The pendant can be used as a shield.

524
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Qin,

525
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
in the future,

526
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
no matter what happens,

527
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
I will always be by your side.

528
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
Let's be together.

529
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Qin,

530
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
I'm sorry.

532
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm sorry.

539
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
I'm sorry.

542
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm sorry.

543
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
I'm sorry.

544
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Do you want to drink?

545
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Do you want to drink?

546
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Xiao Hua,

547
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Boss is waiting for you on the roof.

548
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Go.

549
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Go.

550
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Brother,

551
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
drinking like this

552
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
will speed up your internal organs.

553
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
Even if no one is there to take care of your body,

554
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
you don't have to be so self-confident.

555
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
You can drink it.

556
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm sorry.

558
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I'm sorry.

563
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I'm sorry.

564
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I'm sorry.

565
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Sit.

566
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm a bad brother.

568
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Of course you're not.

569
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
You've always been

570
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
a good-for-nothing.

571
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Every time I make a mistake with Second Sister,

572
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,880
you'll teach us a lesson.

573
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Is that how you treat me?

574
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
Brother,

575
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
if I knew the truth three years ago

576
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
and chose to run away,

577
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,880
what would you do?

578
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
You wouldn't answer.

579
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
I would.

580
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
I really want to run away.

581
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
But there are things

582
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
I have to do on my own.

583
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
And

584
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
we've been suffering

585
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
from the blood of so many innocent people.

586
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Is it lucky

587
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
to have the chance to atone for my sins?

588
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm sorry.

589
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I'm sorry.

590
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm sorry.

592
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Forgive me.

593
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Forgive me.

594
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Brother,

595
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
it's enough

596
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
to be your family for the rest of your life.

597
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Brother,

598
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
you should try to get back on your feet.

599
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
I'm not going back on my feet.

600
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
You should try to get back on your feet.

601
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Brother,

602
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I've made up my mind.

603
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm not going back on my feet.

604
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
I'm not going back on my feet.

605
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm not going back on my feet.

606
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Brother,

607
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
please spare me.

608
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,880
I will be a good man for our Wu Dang.

609
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Third Brother, why are you drinking?

610
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
You are injured, you are not allowed to drink.

611
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Yuan, your third brother is going to the expedition soon.

612
00:37:47,880 --> 00:38:03,660
It's okay to drink a little before the

613
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
expedition.

614
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Promise me.

615
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Okay, okay, I will promise you.

616
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
I will practice hard and be obedient.

617
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Third Brother, you go with me.

618
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Go.

619
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Okay.

620
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880

The past is a scene.

663
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
How many smiles and tears

664
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,880
will make me happy?

665
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,880

The memories are longer.

675
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,880
You and I are getting closer.

676
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Look at the north star.

677
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Heartbeats are silent.

678
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,880
The story has no trace.

679
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,880
A month's worth of mistakes.

680
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Write a memory.

681
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Your voice.

691
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,880
We will never leave each other.

692
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,880
I look for you at the same time.

693
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

694
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
The earth is surrounding you.

695
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Don't doubt me.

696
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,880
My heart always because of you.
