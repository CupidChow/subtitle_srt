5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You must have upset His Majesty again.

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Go back and apologize to His Majesty.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Ruoxuan.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Since the first time I met you in Jin Cui Zhou,

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you have always been like this to me.

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Did I owe you money?

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or did I do anything to you?

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You took away my mother.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know Zhu Yu's daughter?

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My mother is the former queen of the fish tribe, Lingye.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now Zhu Yu's body is my mother's body.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hundreds of years ago,

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
our fish tribe lived in the bottom of the North Sea.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
At that time, our queen, Lingye,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
who was also my mother,

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
was also my mother.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
In the North Sea,

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
she found a warm and cozy place

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and brought all our tribesmen

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
to move there.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
After a hundred years,

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the sea of Tian Qing became more and more prosperous

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and became the pearl of the North Sea at that time.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What happened next?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How did Lingye die?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How did Zhu Yu become the king of the fish tribe?

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But no one expected

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the sea of Tian Qing was built on the Kunbei.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Kun was born in the sea of the fish tribe.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It will sink for tens of thousands of years.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So it will continue to power,

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
waiting for the sea to break out

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and the day the phoenix flies.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You are right.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
On the day the sea of Kun broke out,

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the sea of Tian Qing on the Kunbei

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
almost broke out and sank.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My mother, Lingye,

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
used her last strength

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and used meditation

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to successfully touch Kun's consciousness

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and let him stop flying.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then Kun is Zhu Yu.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
After the king stopped flying,

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he used Lingye's body to show his power

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and began to help us to save the fish tribe.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He collected the fish tribe

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that had a little breath

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and used his own life

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to heal us.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
After a few years,

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the fish tribe with lower injuries

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
or higher cultivation

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
can finally move freely.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The fish tribe that you see

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
outside can still be alive

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and the fish tribe

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is all cured by the king

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
with his own life.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He has spent too much

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and his life has fallen apart.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If it weren't for the origin...

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Since you have returned to the king

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and become the young king of the fish tribe,

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you should understand

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the sacrifice the king made for us.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He is now like this

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
because of us.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Zhu Yu! Zhu Yu!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I thought

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you had already left.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Zhu Yu,

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Shuoxuan told me

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
everything that happened that year.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't know that you were so hard.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Would you like to stay in the Sea of ​​Qin?

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you want to stay,

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am willing to pay any price.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are still considering that I lied to you.

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That is not important anymore.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Zhu Yu,

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Shuoxuan is more suitable

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to be the young master of the Sea of ​​Qin.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't do anything

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
if I stay here.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't understand

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
what he said.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to go out

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and grow up on my own.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Only in this way

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
can I really help you.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My daughter

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
has really grown up.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I often remember

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that time,

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you were in my body.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I felt very strange.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Such a small life

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and heartbeat

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
are much more loud

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
than any other life in the world.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I said,

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
wanting to leave,

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
wanting to be with me,

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is all your freedom.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The Sea of ​​Qin is not a hole.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You hold it,

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and you can feel it.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am willing to pay any price

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
for you to feel my presence

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
with it.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then when I come back next time,

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I will bring you my favorite

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jishi cake.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Go.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mr. Gu.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You finally come.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It seems that someone can't stand it

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and tell you that I will come today.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Miss Ming doesn't eat

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
or go out for a day.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is there anything wrong?

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's because of the master.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Xiu doesn't want to see anyone

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
on her birthday.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I apologize for her.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mr. Gu is serious.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Brother Ju, is this house yours?

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's...

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's...

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Senior, you...

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It...

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not a coin before it's issued.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is it

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
a coin before it's issued?

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Master.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's rare for you to come to Jing'an.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The city is beautiful.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The night view is beautiful.

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Xiu, go out with me.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You two, drink and wait.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then I will go to call Jinzhao.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Come here.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What do you like?

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Pick it yourself.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Look. These lanterns

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
are also Jing'an's characteristics.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Look. What do you like?

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Pick whatever you like.

157
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This one?

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Come.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This lantern is really special.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you, Master.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're welcome.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And Mr. Gu.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This one.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's the same as Miss Ming's.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is it good?

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Such a special lantern.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's the most suitable for the private.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Jinzhao, look at this.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If this little fish is here...

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You go to pick the lantern first.

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Look. It's so lively.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Look over there.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Xiu, they are coming.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Please lean on the shore.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How much is left?

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Five.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Five.

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's left?

183
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Five.

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Five.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Five.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Five.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Five.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Five.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Five.

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Five.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Five.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Xiu, you are...

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sorry.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sorry.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Xiao Zhao Yan.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why is your lantern...

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
different from Xiu's?

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I picked it randomly.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You picked a wolf.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Where is the wolf?

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's a dog.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a dog.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a dog.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a dog.

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This meat is delicious.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I think it's a wolf.

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a wolf.

208
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a wolf.

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a wolf.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a wolf.

211
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's a wolf.

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a wolf.

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a wolf.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a wolf.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's a wolf.

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a wolf.

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a wolf.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a wolf.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a wolf.

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's a wolf.

221
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
It's a wolf.

222
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
It's a wolf.

223
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
It's a wolf.

224
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
It's a wolf.

225
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
It's a wolf.

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Time is endless

227
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
One month of wrongdoing

228
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Writing a letter of memories

229
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
It's all about you

230
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
All the reincarnations, meeting and missing you

231
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
All the unforgettable stars, I can't forget you

232
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
The past is one scene, one scene

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
How many tears of smiles

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Will all be happy

235
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I'm looking for you in the mountains

236
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
The loneliness in the mountain is echoing with me

237
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
The silence of the city, your figure

238
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,600
I can't leave you forever

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm looking for you in this year

240
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Jingzhao, our relationship is not fake

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
There is no way to protect each other

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I know

243
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm looking for you

244
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Happy birthday, Miss Mingxiu.

245
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Thank you.

246
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Welcome back.

247
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,720
Everyone is here.

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Xiaoqiu's birthday today

249
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
will be a happy one.

250
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,000
Hurry up.

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,760
Yes.

252
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,200
We're running out of time.

253
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,480
I made a small mechanism

254
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,880
for Miss Ming.

255
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,760
It can also transmit some small things.

256
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,560
Here.

257
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,920
Miss Ming, do you like it?

258
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,760
Thank you, Shifang.

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,080
Miss Ming,

260
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
I saw this in the jewelry shop.

261
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240
Do you like it?

262
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,760
Thank you, Zhao Yan.

263
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,000
How do you know

264
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,640
it wasn't Brother Han Jiang who told them?

265
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Although it was me who did it.

266
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Only you would say so.

267
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,120
Besides,

268
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,200
it's not an important day.

269
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
I think it's important.

270
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,120
I would do the same for you instead.

271
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,280
Miss Ming,

272
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
birthday is important,

273
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,080
but I still haven't...

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
What do you mean?

275
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:41,880
Here.

276
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,360
It's my birthday gift for Qi.

277
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Here.

278
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,880
Thank you.

279
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
When did you get this?

280
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,080
How did you know I'd be back?

281
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,080
I knew.

282
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,880
Miss Ming,

283
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,640
I heard about a western custom saying

284
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,680
a birthday girl will send a wish on the main abotage.

285
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,960
It's Может gladly if the God does so.

286
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,360
Hurry up and make one.

287
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,840
My wish.

288
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,760
Master knows it.

289
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,120
Master is old.

290
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,520
Master only hopes

291
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,040
someone can make a wish for Xiu'er earlier.

292
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,280
Some wishes

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
can't be made by anyone.

294
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,760
What's Xiao Yue's wish?

295
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,480
I think

296
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,320
it's a food that can't be finished.

297
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,600
My wish is to be with Jinzhao

298
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
and be happy forever.

299
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,360
So I'm more important than food.

300
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
Of course.

301
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,440
When I'm with you,

302
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,960
you'll buy me delicious food.

303
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,280
It's called a pair of two.

304
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Thank you.

305
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,440
You don't have to ask me

306
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
about Jinzhao's wish.

307
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,560
Where's Luo?

308
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
I hope people

309
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,320
can remember that

310
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,480
there's a Luo family in the Western Regions

311
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
and a Luo Zhaoyan.

312
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Master Luo has a great ambition.

313
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,000
I wonder if you have any wishes.

314
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,320
I have no desire in my heart.

315
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,800
What wish?

316
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,120
Please don't hold back.

317
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll do what I can.

318
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,840
Let go of my old ambition.

319
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What about Shi Bao?

320
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,920
My...

321
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
My wish is

322
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,800
to be a great mechanical tree

323
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
like my mother.

324
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,240
And

325
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
we can have another birthday

326
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,040
like tonight.

327
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,360
I'll get it.

328
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
You can make two wishes.

329
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,840
I'll lose.

330
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,960
Come on.

331
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,280
Let's drink together.

332
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,840
Come on.

333
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,880
Come on.

334
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,640
Sister Mingxiu.

335
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,680
Happy birthday.

336
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
Happy birthday.

337
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Happy birthday.

338
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Jinzhao, look.

339
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
There's a lantern.

340
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Come with me.

341
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
Okay.

342
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,800
My little lantern.

343
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
You have to float as far as possible.

344
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,880
Please.

345
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,280
From now on, we'll be together forever.

346
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,240
Don't be apart, okay?

347
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,960
It's a deal.

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,920
The one who's bad is the dog.

349
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,720
Do you remember

350
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,240
the question I asked you

351
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,400
when we were in Kuangdong?

352
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,960
Sister.

353
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
What am I

354
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
to you?

355
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
What's your answer?

356
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,520
Anyway, I'm not your brother.

357
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Young Master.

358
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,720
Don't you mind?

359
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,600
What are you moving specific to?

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, young Master.

361
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,600
Do you want to think about

362
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,680
very last year's

363
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,840
gift-giving event in Ta Ee Palace?

364
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,960
No.

365
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,640
At morning,

366
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,400

Door to the Corridor

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080

374
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,440
Who?

375
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,880
Me.

376
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,600
Teacher.

377
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
I didn't ask you to come here.

378
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,040
Heh.

379
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,480
You know.

380
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,320
Though I'm here in my dream,

381
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,480
I dreamon't of you and Haotian or Xie sincere.

382
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
You're the one selling me surveying.

383
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,960
I still want you believe me.

384
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,200
And at the same time,

385
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,240
I don't spend too much on rampage.

386
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,720
Sorry, I際on't help you out last time.

387
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Master, have you ever thought

388
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
that Xiu'er was just a statue?

389
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Xiu'er has drunk a lot.

390
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Let's sleep for a while.

391
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
Then, will Master

392
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,720
run away while I'm asleep?

393
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Run away?

394
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Master won't leave.

395
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Xiu'er,

396
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
Master is really worried about you.

397
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Mom,

398
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
am I

399
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,720
not talented enough to be a organ-synchro?

400
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,720
I want to be like you

401
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
and be a great organ-synchro like Doubao.

402
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
I want to be like you

403
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
and be a great organ-synchro like Doubao.

404
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
And...

405
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,720
And...

406
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I will protect Doubao.

407
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,720
That's the only thing you left for me.

408
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
This beautiful scenery

409
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
is really a place to be left behind.

410
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Next,

411
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,720
you will be busy with your work.

412
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I won't go with you.

413
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Take care.

414
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Remember to tell me

415
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
when you attack the headquarters.

416
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
I will be there.

417
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
I will be there.

418
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
I will be there.

419
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
I will be there.

420
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
Be careful.

421
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
Okay.

422
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Xianqing,

423
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
where are you going next?

424
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
What?

425
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Can't bear to leave?

426
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
How about we make a deal

427
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
to meet again next time

428
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
and enjoy the scenery

429
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,720
of the day and the river together?

430
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Of course.

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
It's a deal.

432
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
It's a deal.

433
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Brother Wenren,

434
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
I don't care about this matter.

435
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Zhengwu Sect has been in a big trouble recently.

436
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I'm afraid they would be forced

437
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
to act in this attack

438
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
on the headquarters of the Qi Yuan Sect.

439
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
This time,

440
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
it's not easy to find

441
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
the position of the Qi Yuan Sect.

442
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
It's impossible to be lost.

443
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
If we don't do something about it,

444
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
the Qi Yuan Sect will be in a big trouble.

445
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
We have to do something about it.

446
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
You have to do something about it.

447
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Brother Wenren,

448
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
don't worry.

449
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
I will take care of it.

450
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Thank you.

451
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Thank you.

452
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,400
It's hard to beat the King of Yi if you miss it.

453
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,640
Brother Han Xiang, you're good at everything.

454
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,040
You're brave and powerful.

455
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,240
You're a match for the order of the Tai Xin City.

456
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,320
Well,

457
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,640
fine.

458
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,400
But I'm going to participate in this battle too.

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,640
Fine.

460
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,040
I can't wait to see it.

461
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,240
Chief.

462
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,720
Senior Gu.

463
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,240
This is the map provided by Meng City.

464
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,480
There's the position of Qi Yuan Sect's General Hall.

465
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,400
There are two doors here.

466
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,600
The front door is in the middle of the ground.

467
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,480
I'll be responsible for the front door.

468
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,680
As for the back door...

469
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,040
Leave the back door to us.

470
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,680
Okay.

471
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,120
You're all young heroes.

472
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,040
It must be hard for Qi Yuan Sect to defend the back door.

473
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,960
If you can defeat Qi Yuan Sect's General Hall,

474
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,800
it's the best.

475
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,160
It's not up to you.

476
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,480
I'll inform everyone.

477
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,320
Okay.

478
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,240
Master.

479
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,080
Master.

480
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,400
Why didn't you come back with Xian Qing yesterday?

481
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,680
And your eyes.

482
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,600
What happened?

483
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,920
You could touch this extraordinary thing.

484
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,920
Hold this up for me.

485
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,080
Fine.

486
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
You really have many questions, Xi'er.

487
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,520
Let me answer which one.

488
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,520
A few days ago, I was in Google,

489
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:48,140
I was designed to unfold concerted 사람들 with embedding minutia

490
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,700
You will act with Yue Xiao.

491
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,780
Be careful.

492
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Master,

493
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,580
are you not protecting me?

494
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,540
I'm a grown-up.

495
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,380
I don't need your protection.

496
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,740
Master,

497
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,500
never will I disappoint you.

498
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,100
But I've always

499
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,300
been close to you.

500
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,700
but the

501
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,900
봅竇幻想中

502
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,840
but the

503
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,780
resurrection

504
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,880
How is

505
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,060
this communication great

506
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,160
gasps

507
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,560
I can rest assured.

508
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,960
As for the rest,

509
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
even if it costs my life,

510
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,480
I must turn my eyes

511
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,160
and see what's happening.

512
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,120
The five clans

513
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
have been in the world for more than 20 years.

514
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,480
The evil demons

515
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,000
are killing the evil.

516
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
They are climbing the mountains and the sea,

517
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,240
guarding the mountain and river.

518
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,320
Today,

519
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,880
the mountain and river are in danger.

520
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,880
The people of all places

521
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
are suffering from the Qiyuan Sect.

522
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
Our Zhenwu Alliance

523
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,440
must return justice to the world.

524
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
We love justice to the world.

525
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,360
We love justice to the world.

526
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,240
We love justice to the world.

527
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,960
Young Master Yue Jinzhao.

528
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,840
Chief.

529
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,480
This person

530
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,960
is called Yin Zhi Mei Yin.

531
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,280
He was the head of the Shushan Sword God.

532
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,520
He was the son of the Demon King.

533
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,000
Today,

534
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,080
I will give this person to you.

535
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
The so-called evil soldiers

536
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,880
are all using him

537
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,800
to do things that will make the world a better place.

538
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
We are proud of markets

539
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,080
to develop for cause and effect.

540
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,200
Thanks for logging in.

541
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,720
Indian soldiers

542
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,960
are very kind.

543
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,840
No.

544
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,320
Take the cypress with fear

545
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:26,920
and suffer the 안�塹

546
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,440
and hold an audience.

547
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,840
Let this peaceful book

548
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,800
그때

549
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
You are right.

550
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,080
My name is different.

551
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,840
I am young and free,

552
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
since I've come a long way.

553
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,800
Please.

554
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,440
every dandy's傻君

555
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,860
even though your eyes aren't me

556
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,880
try your best to fit your fears

557
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,440
save at the last вы

558
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,680
Remember,

559
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,120
you make it.

560
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,700
The

561
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,320
A great leader.

562
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,000
Aelf,

563
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,480
a well- dwined leader.

564
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,760
I, Gao Xiao,

565
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,300
in the name of the leader of the Queいました Gang,

566
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,740
swear through you

567
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,540
that from now on,

568
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,340
will be loyal to the Lord.

569
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,980
Loyal to the Lord.

570
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,860
Let the glory of the Lord

571
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,540
be known throughout the land.

572
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,700
The Lord is the best!

573
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,340
The Lord is the best!

574
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,660
The Lord is the best!

575
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,340
The Lord is the best!

576
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,540
The Lord is the best!

577
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,180
What's that?

578
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,420
The uprisings of this land

579
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Long live the Emperor!

580
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Long live the Emperor!

581
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
Long live the Emperor!

582
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Long live the Emperor!

583
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Long live the Emperor!

584
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Jin Zhao, why are you so calm every time?

585
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
It seems like you can make up for the past mistakes.

586
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,420
Go to the left.

587
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Jin Zhao, are you alright?

588
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
Don't worry.

589
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,420
It's an old problem.

590
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
I have the ability to make up for the past mistakes.

591
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,420
So,

592
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
I need to quickly get my spirit up.

593
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,420
I have a plan.

594
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,420
I won't lose.

595
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Young Hero Yue, Master Xu,

596
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
let's go in.

597
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,420
Master, you came to the Zhenwu Alliance this time.

598
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
What do you think

599
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,420
he is hiding from me?

600
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,420
Miss Ning, you don't need to worry.

601
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,420
There are many people in the Zhenwu Alliance.

602
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
I'm sure that you can get some information.

603
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,420
There are many people in the Zhenwu Alliance.

604
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Senior Gu is very skilled in martial arts.

605
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,420
I think he won't be in danger.

606
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,420
Let's go.

607
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,420
What are you hesitating about?

608
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,420
Let's go.

609
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
Qing Jun, don't worry.

610
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,420
There are traces of heartbeats on both sides.

611
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
I'm afraid there's a trap.

612
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,420
Let's discuss it first.

613
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,420
Young Hero Yue, look.

614
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,420
Go to the left.

615
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
Listen to Young Hero Yue. Go to the left.

616
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,420
Xu, this heart is getting more reliable.

617
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Of course.

618
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Have you forgotten that

619
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,420
he is not just a member of the Ghost Tribe?

620
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,420
Get out of the way.

621
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,420
I'm sorry.

622
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
