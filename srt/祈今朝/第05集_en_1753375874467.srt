6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's like, but it's not like.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's like...

8
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's like the difference between this vegetable bun and meat bun.

9
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Although they are all buns, the filling is different.

10
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Brother Yue is smart and handsome.

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Dr. Bian...

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Anyway, in my opinion, they are not related at all.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Could it be that Miss Yue has met Dr. Bian before?

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Miss Yue, have you ever heard of Rehai?

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Rehai is a secret. Don't talk about it.

17
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Miss Yue, do you have any differences?

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Very powerful, very smart. Is it counted?

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What about these?

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Then it's not there.

21
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not easy to teach. This is the last time I ask you.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I have one thing to ask.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have a question.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have one thing to ask.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Can I not tell anyone about what I asked you?

26
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why?

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is very important to me.

28
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So please keep it a secret for me.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't tell anyone.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, I promise you. Zhaoyan, you are very good to us.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
As long as Jinzhao doesn't ask, I won't tell anyone.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If Brother Yue asks, don't tell him, okay?

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No. If Jinzhao asks me, I will tell him.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sorry.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The villagers asked me to ask about the disease.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm late. Are you okay?

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Zhaoyan, what's wrong?

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let me see.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you, Dr. Bian. It's just a sprain.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Master Luo doesn't believe my medical skills.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Zhaoyan, let Dr. Bian see it.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Thank you, Dr. Bian.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Master Luo's condition seems to be not good.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's okay. I'll just rest for a while.

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's okay.

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There is nothing wrong with the body.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But the vitality keeps flowing out of the body.

50
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is the curse of the Tanhua Luo family.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't be so rude.

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I told you, you heard it.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dr. Bian said that when these patients wake up,

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
they will understand everything.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't be afraid.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you don't believe Dr. Bian, you have to believe me.

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right?

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm here. What's wrong with that?

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Everything is ready.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just wait for the fish to bite the hook.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Zinzhao, can this trick work?

62
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Of course.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The appearance of the injured has attracted their attention.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wei Lianyan should be the most awake.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They will definitely do something late.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Miss Ming, Senior Xianqing.

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're back from the funeral.

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes. I'm old.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I can't draw the funeral.

70
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We have found the place to live.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go to pick up Luo Xun and Qing.

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look. I drew the map of the whole village.

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What did you draw?

74
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The triangular one represents the house.

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The circular one represents the cave.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Where are we now?

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is where we are now.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is Dr. Bian's house, right?

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes. That's right.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Master, your drawing is really easy to understand.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We will hide near the Bianluo Huan's house.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
When they attack, we can capture them.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother Yue, I don't recommend you to attack in the village.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The sword is sharp.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not good if it hurts innocent people.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then let's force them to the Linyang Road.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Brother Luo, Shi Fang, and Senior Xianqing.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You three guard the place.

90
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Qi, me, and Miss Ming.

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We will guard near the Bianluo Huan's house.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll stay to protect Dr. Bian.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No, no.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you sure?

97
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Jingzhao, you don't seem to want me to stay

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to protect Dr. Bian.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I just want to know if you can do it.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Can you do it if I can't?

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Since everything is arranged,

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
let's go back and fix it.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's go.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dr. Bian, did we know each other before?

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Maybe.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's so sour when I think of Qi.

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How can the Bianluo Huan be sour in my head?

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's so sour.

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's so sour.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so sour.

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's so sour.

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's so sour.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's so sour.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can't do it.

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's so weird.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Jingzhao, do you have water?

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm making a bath.

121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Close your eyes.

122
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why don't you close the door?

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why don't you knock the door?

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't open your eyes.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Jingzhao.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Here.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Here.

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you thirsty too?

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Who?

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who?

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Get out first.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why should I go out?

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Aren't you dressed?

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is there water?

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm really thirsty.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can you enter others' rooms

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and be a good man in future?

138
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are not another person.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,200
I want to cry

140
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,080
Li Zhao, you look like a little girl in a yellow flower

141
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Really

142
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,680
The little girl in the yellow flower you saw in my drawing book

143
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,000
Lu Yuqi is exactly the same as what others saw

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,480
When they were seen

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
Not a brain-shamed Chen Lu

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,440
It's a bad luck

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,080
Look, look, bad luck

148
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,480
I'm crying again this year

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Jin Zhao

150
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,440
Don't make me eat, I don't want to play with you

151
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,440
Qi

152
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
Will you do this

153
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,200
Shave someone's head

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,280
No

155
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,000
why

156
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,840
Because Zhao Yun has a sister

157
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,440
There are bean bags in the kitchen

158
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,280
Mingxiu has a husband

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,440
You are so pitiful

160
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,920
No one else is only me

161
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm not pitiful

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,000
I still have myself

163
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,640
Hua Hua's daughter

164
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,080
Hua Hua, you are a head

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,080
Water is coming

166
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,680
Drink quickly

167
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,880
Comfortable

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,720
Come

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Qi

170
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,480
Why do you like drinking water so much

171
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
Jin Zhao, will you make grass-dried butterflies

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,440
No

173
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,000
Why suddenly ask me if I can make grass-dried butterflies

174
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
In Dr. Bian's grass club

175
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,760
There are many beautiful grass-dried butterflies

176
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,160
I also want one

177
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
How can a man like a girl

178
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Just changed things

179
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Then I will ask Dr. Bian for one

180
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,120
When did you get so familiar with Dr. Bian

181
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,600
Didn't I tell you ten thousand times

182
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
Don't talk to strangers casually

183
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,640
I have always been very familiar with him

184
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,240
I think Dr. Bian and Jin Zhao

185
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,840
You give me a very similar feeling

186
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,560
So I think he is very close

187
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Jin Zhao

188
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Jin Zhao

189
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,280
Jin Zhao

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,760
abajo

191
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,280
Jin Zhao, what's the matter

192
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,520
He apologized.

193
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,840
He said we'll be friends from now on.

194
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,920
He's a good boy.

195
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,560
He's much better than his sister.

196
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
He asked me if I knew about the hot sea.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
Hot sea?

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,800
How did you answer?

199
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,400
You told me to keep it a secret.

200
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,920
So I said I didn't know.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,360
But Zhaoyan also asked me to keep it a secret.

202
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,560
Zhaoyan asked you to keep it a secret.

203
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
Why did you tell me?

204
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,160
I promised her I'd keep it a secret as long as you didn't ask.

205
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,120
But you asked me.

206
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,640
I can't lie to you.

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,320
You're a good girl.

208
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,320
Come on, have some water.

209
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Zhaoyan, are you enjoying the beautiful scenery?

210
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,280
Senior.

211
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
No.

212
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you worried about tonight's operation?

213
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,800
We have limited people.

214
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,760
If we fail tonight,

215
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,360
we'll be in danger.

216
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,560
We'll be in danger.

217
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,600
We'll be in danger.

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,800
We'll be in danger.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
We'll be in danger.

220
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
We'll be in danger.

221
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
If we fail tonight,

222
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Dr. Bian and that patient

223
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
may be in danger.

224
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,120
Didn't you decide

225
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,720
the result of the operation?

226
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
If you decide to

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,240
hesitate in the middle,

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,480
Zhaoyan,

229
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,720
you're a good person.

230
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,680
What you said

231
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,120
is like what a family member said.

232
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,880
Maybe

233
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,360
I'm a good person

234
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,160
just like what he said.

235
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,840
I haven't seen such an innocent person like you for a long time.

236
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
You're interesting and cute.

237
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Cute?

238
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,840
Senior,

239
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm not the one who says cute.

240
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,560
Only my first impression is appropriate to a president.

241
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,480
The first performance of the new recruit

242
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,080
and the second challenge of the new recruit

243
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,520
are the first interesting performances.

244
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,480
First,

245
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
We must not lose to Qi Yuan tribe today.

246
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
We must not.

247
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Let's go.

248
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Brother Luo.

249
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Brother Luo.

250
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
I'm going to trouble you tonight.

251
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
You have to guard the bag of rabbits with me.

252
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Miss Ming, Senior, and Shi Fang.

253
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
You are ambushed on the Lianyang Road.

254
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
After Brother Luo and I lure them over,

255
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
we'll beat them up.

256
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Qi Yuan, you watch the road first.

257
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Then the driver and we will meet.

258
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
If you meet a powerful opponent on the way,

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
don't be stubborn.

260
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
We'll run away after we beat them.

261
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I've been waiting for you.

262
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Mao Wei, they...

263
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
We're caught.

264
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Retreat.

265
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Go.

266
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I'll protect this place.

267
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Why am I feeling sleepy all of a sudden?

268
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Why...

269
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Why aren't they looking at me?

270
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Why aren't they looking at you?

271
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm so sleepy.

272
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Look at my egg.

273
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
There's a demon.

274
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
I'm going to kill you tonight.

275
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
Miss Ming, don't.

276
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
The Hall Leader Yu is familiar with the demon.

277
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Why are you helping him?

278
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Miss Xue Xuan is a demon?

279
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Come on, keep running.

280
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Where's Shi Fang?

281
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Little Shi Fang was caught by a demon.

282
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I'll go take a look.

283
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Wait.

284
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm going to go check on him.

285
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I'll go check on him.

286
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll go check on him.

287
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
I'll go check on him.

288
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll go check on him.

289
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I'll go check on him.

290
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I'll go check on him.

291
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'll go check on him.

292
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Miss Xue Xuan, are you a good demon or a bad demon?

293
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
You don't deserve to know.

294
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
I'm not a useless demon.

295
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I just don't want to fight with you.

296
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Miss Xue Xuan, are you going to kill me?

297
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
You're a dead rat.

298
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Why do I have to kill you?

299
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Are you...

300
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Are you...

301
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Are you really related to Qi Yuan Sect?

302
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I really don't like the little sect of Qi Yuan Sect.

303
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
You're blinded by the people of Qi Yuan Sect.

304
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
That's why you do things that harm the innocent.

305
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Why don't you put down your weapons?

306
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Tell me who's behind it.

307
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
It's easy to make up for it.

308
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Harm the innocent?

309
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
You dare to insult Qi Yuan's reputation?

310
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
You're not allowed to.

311
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
Brothers, kill.

312
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
You...

313
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
It's you.

314
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
Miss Xue Xuan,

315
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,480
if one day we fight against each other,

316
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I...

317
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,480
I will definitely defeat you and lead you to the right path.

318
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
You really dare to think about it?

319
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
Just because of your broken mechanisms,

320
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
you dare to fight against me?

321
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
You deserve it.

322
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
And...

323
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,480
You're a good disciple.

324
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
We're not on the same side.

325
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
In the future,

326
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
in the future,

327
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
stay away from me.

328
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Xu Fang!

329
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
How are you?

330
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Are you okay?

331
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
I'm fine.

332
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Miss Xue Xuan didn't kill me.

333
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Xue Xuan?

334
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
She's a demon?

335
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
She's gone.

336
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Last time, she cared about Qi Jiu a lot.

337
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
This time, it's her again.

338
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Next time I see her,

339
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I must ask her.

340
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Let's go and find Brother Luo.

341
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Oh no, we're exposed.

342
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
If that person kills us,

343
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
why don't they tell us?

344
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
Liu Huo He!

345
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
You're a coward.

346
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm the one who's watching Qi and Yue Jin Zhao.

347
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Not you.

348
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Do you think I'm willing to watch them?

349
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Last time you reported in Jin Cui Zhou,

350
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
you've already aroused Yue Jin Zhao's suspicion.

351
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
If you dare to interfere again,

352
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
I'll be rude to you.

353
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Let's go.

354
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Bai Cun My Little Brother

355
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Xie Shan Shu Yuan

356
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,600
Weeshan

357
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,480
How come I fell asleep?

358
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,320
Dr. Bian.

359
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,920
Dr. Bian.

360
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Let me see.

361
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,800
Let me see.

362
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Are you okay?

363
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,520
That's good.

364
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,120
What about him?

365
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
He's about to wake up.

366
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,680
What about Jinzhao?

367
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
Why haven't they come back yet?

368
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,440
Could he be in some danger?

369
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
As expected.

370
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
He's awake.

371
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
He's awake.

372
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
As expected.

373
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,040
He can't do without me.

374
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
That idiot.

375
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,720
Jinzhao, are you okay?

376
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,280
How could I get hurt so easily?

377
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,160
Zhu. Zhu.

378
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,920
Zhu.

379
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,240
My son.

380
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,040
Master.

381
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,440
You don't look well.

382
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Are you hurt?

383
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,760
No.

384
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,040
I just saw a lot of people died.

385
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,240
I just wanted to catch them.

386
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,000
I didn't expect to force them to die.

387
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,000
I caused their death.

388
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,400
Master Ju.

389
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,200
As the leader of the Zhenwu Alliance,

390
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,640
you're afraid of these people

391
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
who use demons to kill demons.

392
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm not afraid.

393
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,440
It's just that

394
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,160
they're all living people.

395
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,320
It's you who killed them.

396
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
It's them.

397
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
It's them.

398
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
It's them.

399
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
It's them.

400
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
It's them.

401
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Master.

402
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
It's them.

403
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
It's them.

404
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
You're evil.

405
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,600
They're the ones who died.

406
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,120
How dare you question me?

407
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,760
You're planning to

408
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,600
harm people.

409
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
It's them.

410
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
It's them.

411
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
It's them.

412
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Uncle Ju.

413
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Listen to me.

414
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,280
We came here

415
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,560
because we knew

416
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,240
it might be the base of Qiyuan Sect.

417
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,280
The people who died

418
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
are the people of Qiyuan Sect.

419
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,000
So they deserve to die, right?

420
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,800
No.

421
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
We wanted to

422
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,960
lure them out and catch them.

423
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,560
But we didn't expect them to kill themselves.

424
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,960
Why don't we go to their house

425
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,360
and check it out?

426
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
See if there's any clue.

427
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Brother Yue, don't say anymore.

428
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,480
I'm in charge of this.

429
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,800
It's my fault

430
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
that I couldn't stop them from committing suicide.

431
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,160
Everyone.

432
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,720
I'm willing to bear your sadness and anger

433
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
on my own.

434
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,160
You bear it?

435
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,360
You bear it?

436
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,600
You want them to come back alive?

437
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Yes.

438
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
They're back.

439
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,240
They're back.

440
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
They're back.

441
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
They're back.

442
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
They're back.

443
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
They're back.

444
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
You...

445
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
You...

446
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Xiao Zhao Yan.

447
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Don't talk to them.

448
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Yes.

449
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Everyone.

450
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm afraid

451
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,480
you're the heroes of Zhou Wu.

452
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,600
Why are you out here?

453
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Are you okay?

454
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm much better.

455
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,160
If you don't explain the situation,

456
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,640
the heroes can't escape.

457
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,920
Everyone, listen to me.

458
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
My name is Lang Mo.

459
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
I'm from the Mammut Fort.

460
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
I came to do business in Yunhui Castle.

461
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,560
The people of Qiyuan Sect

462
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
beat me to a pulp.

463
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
Then they locked me up.

464
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,960
There are many people

465
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
who were locked up with me.

466
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
It's them.

467
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Impossible.

468
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Impossible.

469
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,480
I don't know what happened to them.

470
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Everyone.

471
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Go and save them.

472
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,480
Are you telling the truth?

473
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
I swear on my life.

474
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
I swear on my life.

475
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Okay.

476
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Fine.

477
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
I'll let you

478
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
take a look at Zhu'er's room.

479
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Let's go.

480
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Are you okay?

481
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Lang Mo.

482
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I'll take you to the grass room.

483
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,480
I can go back by myself.

484
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Mr. Luo.

485
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Go.

486
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
What's going on?

487
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
They made a secret room.

488
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
What's going on?

489
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
They made a secret room.

490
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Jingzhao.

491
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Do you think there are Qiyuan Pearls here?

492
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
I don't know.

493
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I don't know.

494
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Xiu.

495
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
What's this?

496
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
This is a mystery herb.

497
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
I've been practicing it for a long time.

498
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
I remember when I was in Fujin Hall,

499
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
I found this kind of herb.

500
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
It seems that the mystery herb of Qiyuan Sect

501
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
is made of this kind of herb.

502
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Although it tastes very light,

503
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
it does taste like this

504
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
in the house of the Dragon-Eye.

505
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
You mean...

506
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Unless it's freshly spread,

507
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
otherwise,

508
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
it's hard to smell it.

509
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Besides,

510
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
I've never heard that

511
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
the Chief Qi has this kind of herb.

512
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Qi.

513
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
Did anything wrong

514
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
with the Pellet Ring last night?

515
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Last night,

516
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,480
I fell asleep in the grass house of Dr. Bian.

517
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
So you don't know

518
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
what he did.

519
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
You suspect that

520
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
the Pellet Ring made Miss Yue fall asleep on purpose.

521
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Xiao Yue.

522
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Move forward.

523
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Okay.

524
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Xiao Yue has been in the grass house for too long.

525
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
There are several bodies on him.

526
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I can't tell the exact smell.

527
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Well.

528
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Did we think too much?

529
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Maybe it's just that Xiao Yue is too tired.

530
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
I also think that Dr. Bian is not a bad person.

531
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
He even helped us save Lao Mo.

532
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Those disciples

533
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
said something interesting before they died.

534
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
That person will kill me.

535
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
It means that the person who ordered them

536
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
is now with us.

537
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
And this Pellet Ring is really powerful.

538
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,480
The people of the Yellow River can't be confused.

539
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Let's pretend that we don't know anything

540
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
and observe it.

541
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
Let's go.

542
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Go.

543
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Go to Dr. Bian.

544
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Hurry up.

545
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Are they still alive?

546
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Let's take them out first.

547
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Let's split up.

548
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Let's take action.

549
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
You guys take them out.

550
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Qi He, Shi Fang and I

551
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
will stay here and continue to search.

552
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
This box

553
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
looks quite special.

554
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
This is a mechanical box.

555
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
Let me try it.

556
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Be careful.

557
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
Push me.

558
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Be careful.

559
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Be careful.

560
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
Qi He.

561
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Qi He.

562
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Xiao Yue.

563
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Qin Chao.

564
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Let Dr. Bian and Xiao Yue see it.

565
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Qi.

566
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Take this medicine and give it to him.

567
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
It can temporarily suppress the poison.

568
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
If you hesitate,

569
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
he will die.

570
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
If you hesitate,

571
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
he will die.

572
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
If you hesitate,

573
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
he will die.

574
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
If you hesitate,

575
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
he will die.

576
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Shi Fang.

577
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Come on.

578
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Please.

579
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Dr. Bian,

580
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
how is he?

581
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
The situation has stabilized temporarily.

582
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
What do you mean temporarily?

583
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
If it wasn't because you broke in,

584
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Qi wouldn't have come back.

585
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
If anything happens to him,

586
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
I will never let you go.

587
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I don't want anything to happen to him either.

588
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Qin.

589
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Qin.

590
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
I want to drink water.

591
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
You should rest.

592
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll take care of Qi.

593
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Then...

594
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Let's go out first.

595
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Qin.

596
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Water.

597
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Water.

598
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Qin.

599
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
Water.

600
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Water.

601
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Here.

602
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Water.

603
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Mr. Yue.

604
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
He is really your sister.

605
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Your reaction

606
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
is not like a normal brother.

607
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
The two of them seem to be a pair.

608
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Not like a normal brother.

609
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Why is Dr. Bian

610
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
so sad?

611
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
Doctors are kind.

612
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Miss Yue is seriously injured.

613
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
She is a doctor,

614
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
but she can't do anything.

615
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
This kind of feeling

616
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
should be like a normal brother.

617
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
You are right.

618
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Miss Yue is seriously injured.

619
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
She is a doctor,

620
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
but she can't do anything.

621
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
This kind of feeling

622
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
is like those disciples

623
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,480
committing suicide in front of us.

624
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,480
We can't stop them.

625
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
But they are gone.

626
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Mr. Xianqing.

627
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Why didn't I see you just now?

628
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
The box was in the room.

629
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
Do you want to see it?

630
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I just care about Miss Yue's injury.

631
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
I forgot about it.

632
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Let's go together.

633
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
You go first.

634
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
I'll wait for you.

635
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Let's go.

636
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Is Dr. Bian

637
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
worried about Yue's injury?

638
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
As a doctor,

639
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I can't detoxify her.

640
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
I might be wrong.

641
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
If those disciples are not dead,

642
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
and Xiao Zhaoyan and others

643
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
follow the pattern

644
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,480
and get the antidote,

645
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Yue won't have to suffer

646
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
this kind of trouble.

647
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Dr. Bian,

648
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
do you think so?

649
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Mr. Xianqing seems to have a good idea.

650
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Time Flies

651
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,480
The shooting star in the sky

652
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
burns the past

653
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:50,480
It's all my plan

654
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,480
It's my destiny to bring you the truth

655
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Even if the ending is hard to tell

656
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,480
I will give you a chance to exchange a little bit of my life

657
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Leave it to love, a shameless explanation

658
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,480
It's my destiny to do my best for you

659
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Even if the effort is not enough

660
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,480
I will give you a chance to exchange a little bit of my life

661
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Leave it to love, a shameless explanation
