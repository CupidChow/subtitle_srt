6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It is said that the Lord is the ancient beast,

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and it roams in the sky and has the power to destroy the world.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The human clan, the Qiyuan clan, is the master of the people,

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and it is the master of the people.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It is the master of the people.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The dark energy of the people is about to be out of control.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The people of the Qiyuan clan are about to be destroyed.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's time.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In the future, the hope of saving the people will be on him.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In the future, the hope of saving the people will be on him.

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

20
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Xiao Huan, go seal the Qiyuan clan and send it to the human world.

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Master, I know it's you.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Master, stop hiding. Come out.

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Did the Silver-tongue Spirit take us to the human world?

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Master, what's wrong?

30
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,400
Why are you acting strange today?

31
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,280
Qi Yue,

32
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,680
your thoughts come from your thoughts.

33
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,720
Do you know the mission of the Sword?

34
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,600
The mission of the Sword?

35
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,640
Is the Sword to kill people?

36
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,280
But I don't want to kill people.

37
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,920
Master, what are you doing?

38
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Master,

39
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,800
what are you doing?

40
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,520
Master, I know it's you.

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,040
Master, stop hiding.

42
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Come out.

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,560
Qi...

44
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Qi...

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,520
Qi...

46
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
Qi, think about it.

47
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,720
Think about it.

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,800
Yue...

49
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,240
Qi...

50
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,800
You...

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,200
Zhao...

52
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you doing?

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are you pinching me?

54
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
I dreamed about my master again.

55
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
If you hadn't interrupted me,

56
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,360
I would have seen his face.

57
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,240
Stop it. You always say that.

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
If you could see it, you would have.

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,080
If I had said that, my master wouldn't exist.

60
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Who said my master didn't exist?

61
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,440
If he didn't exist,

62
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,400
where did I learn these tricks?

63
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
Yue Qi,

64
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been taking care of you for three years.

65
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,480
But I'm no match for your shameless master.

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,480
Tell me the truth.

67
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
You can't do anything.

68
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
I'll do it. I'll do it.

69
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,360
I'll do it.

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
I'll beat you. I'll beat you.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm your elder brother.

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
Who said you're older than me?

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,240
Three years ago, when we woke up in the Wuyuan Village,

74
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,400
we didn't remember

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,760
what happened before.

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,200
And you said

77
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,320
our birthdays were on the same day.

78
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,760
You little brain.

79
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
You don't know anything else.

80
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,680
You just remember that?

81
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
But today is

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,840
our 14th day of the seventh lunar month.

83
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,560
So what should we eat?

84
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
Egg noodles.

85
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Let's go.

86
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,720
Enjoy.

87
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Xiaorou, a bowl of chicken and fish noodles.

88
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't add green onion.

89
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,920
Okay.

90
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,280
Qi,

91
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,080
your hair is so broken.

92
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Let's change it.

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
No.

94
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
I'll wear it when I wake up.

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,000
Maybe it's related to my birth.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Maybe it's really from my master.

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,080
I really hope you have a master

98
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
so that our birth

99
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
can be a clue.

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
I really dreamed of him.

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
But in my dream,

102
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
I couldn't see his face clearly

103
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,560
and couldn't remember what he said.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,240
But I was thinking...

105
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
Sir, the noodles are here.

106
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,520
What are you thinking about?

107
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,240
Cream.

108
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,320
I must be hungry.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

110
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,360
Jinzhao,

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
you said you were older than me.

112
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,840
Why didn't you let me have it?

113
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
It's the old rule.

114
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,920
Whoever steals it will have it.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,520
You...

116
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
You said it.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Whoever steals it first will have it.

118
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,520
I'll give it to you.

119
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
Why don't you eat it?

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm not bored.

121
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
I can steal an egg

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,080
and have a magic trick.

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,560
Okay.

124
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,520
Are you kidding me?

125
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,600
You're so bad at it.

126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,560
I thought I learned it from you.

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,400
I deserve this noodle.

128
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
Why do you like egg noodles so much?

129
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
Because Jinzhao made egg noodles

130
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,880
for me for the first time.

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Xie,

132
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
eat slowly.

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Leave me some soup.

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,480
Okay.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's get started.

136
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,760
I drew it last night.

137
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
This is the person I saw with my left eye.

138
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,400
Is this a ghost painting?

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,880
What?

140
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,760
What ghost painting?

141
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
It's obviously a ghost painting, okay?

142
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,720
It's a ghost painting.

143
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
Stop it.

144
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
Compared to your dream,

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,960
my left eye is more reliable.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,640
After we cut the clue,

147
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,360
my left eye

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,080
can see some scenes

149
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
that will happen in the future.

150
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,320
Although...

151
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Seeing the future at the cost of your left eye

152
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
is so painful.

153
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Jinzhao,

154
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
I can recite what you said.

155
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
Leave me alone.

156
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,720
Anyway, we're here to win the treasure.

157
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,040
We have to find this man.

158
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,880
No matter what,

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
we have to find him.

160
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,080
Jinzheng,

161
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,400
your birthday present this year

162
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
hasn't arrived yet.

163
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,560
It's all yours,

164
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:23,220
draw any 우

165
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,040
Zhirong,

166
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,840
could it be a 방송?

167
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
Their surprise birthday present

168
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,040
has arrived.

169
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
They looked very excited.

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Give it to me.

171
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,960
Where is it?

172
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,720
Of course I need it.

173
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,680
You...

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
Yue Jinzhao,

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,440
do you want to give me a present?

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,760
No, I have no money.

177
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
If this goes on, we'll be broke.

178
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Think about it.

179
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Let alone the hotel,

180
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,800
we ate two bowls of beef noodles last night.

181
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
It was 8 yuan.

182
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,360
My family was greedy for food,

183
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
so we spent 5 yuan.

184
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
In the end,

185
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,480
you got a rice cake.

186
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
Most importantly,

187
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
you were hungry

188
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,240
and ate two bowls of egg noodles.

189
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,000
We have no money.

190
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,120
So,

191
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,560
we have to find this person first.

192
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,480
I'll calculate it.

193
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,920
With our reward,

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
we can run around the whole Yinhui Castle

195
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,600
in less than an hour.

196
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,400
It's a stupid idea.

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,840
Then, you can think of a clever idea.

198
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's go.

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,840
This is the center.

200
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,120
Meet here in an hour.

201
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
I know, you stinky Jinzhao.

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,040
Come and have a look.

203
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,880
The best jewel on the table is...

204
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,760
Miss.

205
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,400
Boss.

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,760
How much is this?

207
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,200
10 yuan.

208
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,880
10 yuan?

209
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
It's more expensive than two bowls of beef noodles.

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,160
You don't give me money.

211
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,880
Stinky Jinzhao.

212
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
I want to cry and mourn.

213
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,560
Three bowls of rice cake.

214
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,240
10 yuan per person.

215
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,880
That's right.

216
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,760
You said it.

217
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,640
I want to make money.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,800
Okay, Miss.

219
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Try crying.

220
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
Okay.

221
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,920
I can't cry.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,880
How can I cry?

223
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,080
How can your family cry when they leave?

224
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,880
How can you cry?

225
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,880
I don't have a family.

226
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,760
Don't you have a family?

227
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,960
Aren't you poor?

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,000
But I have Jinzhao.

229
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm not poor.

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,840
Besides,

231
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
after a person dies,

232
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,280
he can go back to the reincarnation.

233
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,680
Then he can start over.

234
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Why do you want to cry?

235
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,920
This girl

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
doesn't seem like a normal person.

237
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
Miss.

238
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
You'd better go wherever you want.

239
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
Bad news.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,480
The horse is in danger.

241
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,760
Are you okay?

242
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Are you okay?

243
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,720
Thank you.

244
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
Thank you, Miss.

245
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,320
Thank you.

246
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,760
Professor, are you okay?

247
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,840
You go check if there are any injured people.

248
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,360
Check the damage to the shop.

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,040
Yes.

250
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Miss Baoqian.

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
Are you okay?

252
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
I'm fine.

253
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you okay?

254
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm fine.

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
Are you okay?

256
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm fine.

257
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,840
Are you okay?

258
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,000
Miss Baoqian.

259
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,520
That horse is the horse of our Luo family.

260
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,960
It was scared by the fire just now.

261
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
Thank you for saving it.

262
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,560
Red clothes.

263
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
High horse tail.

264
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,400
Miss.

265
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,400
But

266
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,640
you look much better than in the painting.

267
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,680
This is your gift.

268
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,520
You deserve it.

269
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,240
Thank you, Mister.

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
You're so generous.

271
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
But

272
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,800
just give me ten yuan.

273
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,440
You deserve

274
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,440
your justice.

275
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,800
I have to go now.

276
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,440
Goodbye.

277
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
You don't have to pay for the white one.

278
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,240
You can pay for the blue one.

279
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
It's gone.

280
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,440
The blue one is fine, too.

281
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,720
The people of Qiyuan Sect

282
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,840
serve the Lord

283
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,520
and make the people happy.

284
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
Those who have a wish will be blessed.

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Am I right?

286
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,360
Yes.

287
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,040
Tell the people of Yunyun

288
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,600
how it was.

289
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
Will Qiyuan Sect

290
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,200
know my and Tianzhao's background?

291
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,560
Protect the Lord.

292
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,840
Protect the Lord.

293
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,120
Protect the Lord.

294
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,080
Mr. Meng.

295
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,840
Why hasn't the two men

296
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,240
that Mr. Shengxuan invited arrived yet?

297
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,480
Why are you in a hurry?

298
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,040
The Lord's faith

299
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,680
is very strong.

300
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,600
He is traveling around the world now.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,360
He is protecting the people outside.

302
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,960
We should

303
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,960
serve the Lord.

304
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,760
Protect the Lord.

305
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,320
There's another one.

306
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,440
Protect the Lord.

307
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,120
This lady looks familiar.

308
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
This is the first time

309
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,720
I've heard of Qiyuan Sect.

310
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,080
You are?

311
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm Meng Cheng.

312
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm a teacher of Qiyuan Sect.

313
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,840
I'm the first teacher

314
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,400
of Qiyuan Sect.

315
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,600
I forgot the past.

316
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,200
Can you tell me?

317
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,520
The past

318
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,560
is not under the picture.

319
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,880
To be honest,

320
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,520
I'm better at magic than Qiyuan Sect.

321
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,920
Magic?

322
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
Can you tell me

323
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
my background?

324
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
Wait a minute.

325
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,620
You will have to choose a star flame.

326
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,160
Here.

327
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,220
Watermelon.

328
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,460
YouS problèmes.

329
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,000
Where is Qi going?

330
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,160
Where is Qi?

331
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,760
I saw it.

332
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,400
You are from a rich family.

333
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,720
You must have been playing around secretly behind your family.

334
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,800
You are wrong.

335
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,840
If I was born rich and noble,

336
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
why didn't my family come to me?

337
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Well...

338
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
You have forgotten the past,

339
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,520
how can you know I'm wrong?

340
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Moreover,

341
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,680
the leader of Qiyuan Sect

342
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,320
knows everything about the world.

343
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,920
He will never make a mistake.

344
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,800
So tell me,

345
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
where is my family now?

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,280
Miss,

347
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,960
you don't have enough money.

348
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,120
I can't help you to promote more.

349
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,880
You don't know at all.

350
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,040
No.

351
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,560
Not enough money means you have more merits.

352
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
But today,

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
as long as I can give you a little money

354
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
to increase your connection with the leader,

355
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
I can promote more for you.

356
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,160
Look.

357
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,800
Look.

358
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,320
So many people are accumulating merits.

359
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,480
You should go now.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
It's too late.

361
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,080
We wish Qiyuan Sect a good future.

362
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,200
We wish you a good future.

363
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,320
We wish you a good future.

364
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,400
Miss,

365
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,760
I've been investigating Qiyuan Sect for a long time.

366
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,560
The so-called merits

367
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,200
are just the means of the Qiyuan Sect's money.

368
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,040
Don't be fooled.

369
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

370
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Qiyuan Sect is a place for the people.

371
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,160
We volunteer to give the money

372
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,600
to the leader.

373
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,040
Yes.

374
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yes.

375
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Yes.

376
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Yes.

377
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
Yes.

378
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Yes.

379
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Yes.

380
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Yes.

381
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Let's go.

382
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Okay.

383
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
It's him.

384
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
He is the key to the Wangzhao's body.

385
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
We have to find a way to get their money.

386
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
We should get the money.

387
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
He slanders the Holy Land.

388
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
He is evil.

389
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Stop him.

390
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Stop him.

391
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
You're right.

392
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Qiyuan Sect can't slander us.

393
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Sir.

394
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Who are you?

395
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
I'm just an ordinary person.

396
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm a normal person.

397
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm a person who is evil and good.

398
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm a person who is determined to protect the holy and reputation.

399
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Professor Meng.

400
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Isn't this another person?

401
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Isn't this a good thing?

402
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
It's a small thing.

403
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
This young man is right.

404
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
He's right.

405
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Everything is under the protection of the Lord.

406
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
That's right.

407
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
The Lord is right.

408
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
The Lord is right.

409
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
The Lord is right.

410
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
The Lord is right.

411
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
The Lord is right.

412
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
The Lord is right.

413
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I've been investigating.

414
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I've seen Qiyuan Sect's death.

415
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
The Lord is the culprit.

416
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
I won't allow anyone to be a tiger.

417
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
You've insulted Qiyuan Sect many times.

418
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
You're the biggest sin.

419
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Professor Meng.

420
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I'll teach him a good lesson.

421
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Okay.

422
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
The Lord will punish you.

423
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
Why don't you join us?

424
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
You'll have a good chance.

425
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Jingzhao.

426
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Is it him?

427
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Of course.

428
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Jingzhao.

429
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Jingzhao.

430
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
It's dangerous here.

431
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Professor Meng, you go first.

432
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Okay.

433
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Wait.

434
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,040
You said you wanted us to join the Holy Family.

435
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Is that true?

436
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
I'll wait for you in the Fujin Hall.

437
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Okay.

438
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'll clean up the map first.

439
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Take it.

440
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Go.

441
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
This girl is so strong.

442
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Qi.

443
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
Take it.

444
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
This guy

445
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
was wronged.

446
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
What do you mean?

447
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
The audience has left.

448
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Who are you going to show the play to?

449
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
You did it on purpose.

450
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Jingzhao can act and lie.

451
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
You're too shy to say it.

452
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
You were easily deceived by others.

453
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
You're so good at acting.

454
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
You're so good at acting.

455
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
You're so good at acting.

456
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
You're so good at acting.

457
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
You were easily deceived by others.

458
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
You're so good at acting.

459
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Who said I was deceived?

460
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,040
The money bag was full of stones.

461
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
There was no copper plate.

462
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,040
The copper plate is here.

463
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,040
When did you learn to trick people?

464
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,040
You tricked me with the stones first.

465
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I'm sorry.

466
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I thought you really wanted to give money to Qiyuan Sect.

467
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
No.

468
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,040
I didn't expect that I was wronged and deceived them.

469
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
You're so cute.

470
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
You have a good taste.

471
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
My name is Yue Qi.

472
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
This is Yue Jingzhao.

473
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
I'm Luo Zhaoyan.

474
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
The owner of the Luo family?

475
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Although we haven't been here for a few days,

476
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,040
I heard that the Luo family has been protecting the people around here for hundreds of years.

477
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
They're very fond of them.

478
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I heard from the storyteller that

479
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,040
the Luo family is known as the Tang and the Luo family.

480
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,040
The Luo family has been living in a double-bottomed family.

481
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,040
They can't live more than twenty or thirty years old.

482
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I'm so sorry.

483
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
I'm sorry.

484
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
She doesn't know human feelings.

485
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
She's just talking.

486
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Please understand.

487
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
It's okay.

488
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,040
She's used to hearing about what everyone knows.

489
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
I'm sorry.

490
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
It's okay.

491
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
You two.

492
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
The people of Qiyuan Sect are cunning and murderous.

493
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
The master behind them is hidden and intrusive.

494
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,040
The way to get in is unpredictable.

495
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
I saw the girl talking to Meng Cheng just now.

496
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I was afraid that she would be fooled, so I came out.

497
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
Qiyuan Sect dared to deceive us.

498
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
She's lucky that she didn't get lucky.

499
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Since our goals are the same, why don't we join forces?

500
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
They've been gone for a while.

501
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
If we delay it any longer, we won't be able to catch up.

502
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Thank you.

503
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Please.

504
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
She's the one I saw with my left eye.

505
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
Keep an eye on her.

506
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
Okay.

507
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I'll keep an eye on her.

508
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Let's go.

509
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Miss Yue.

510
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
What's wrong?

511
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
It's okay.

512
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
It's okay.

513
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Brother Luoluo.

514
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
How old are you?

515
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
Where do you live?

516
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
How many people do you have?

517
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Are you married?

518
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
That's not what she meant.

519
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
That's what she meant.

520
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Do you know what you mean?

521
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Isn't it to ask her clearly?

522
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Brother Yue.

523
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
What do you mean?

524
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
I mean that you're married.

525
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm not married.

526
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Brother Yue.

527
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I know.

528
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
Miss Yue must have no feelings for me.

529
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
No.

530
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
That's what I meant.

531
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I...

532
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I really have no feelings for her.

533
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Brother Lu.

534
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
This person is in Fujin Hall.

535
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,040
We want to figure out if Fujin Hall is the base of Qiyun Sect.

536
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I think we should go in first.

537
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
It seems that Brother Yue has a good plan.

538
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I've just obtained the trust of that person.

539
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm going to pretend to join him.

540
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
See if he can take me in.

541
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
The premise is that we need to borrow a lot of money from Brother Lu.

542
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
This one.

543
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Where's mine?

544
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Yes, where's his?

545
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Yexin Buyu.

546
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll be outside.

547
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Call me if you need anything.

548
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Of course.

549
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Let's go.

550
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
I'll be outside.

551
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
You almost drove Luo Zhaoyan away.

552
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
But that's what it says in the script.

553
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
That's what the matchmaker asked before the marriage.

554
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Are you going to marry him?

555
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Brother Luo is handsome and cool.

556
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
He's very righteous.

557
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
He's a good match for you.

558
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
He's a good match.

559
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
His name is Luo Zhaoyan.

560
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
He's respected by his family.

561
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
He's close to Luo Xiong.

562
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
He calls him Brother Zhaoyan.

563
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
What does Brother Luo mean?

564
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Because he's generous.

565
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Alright.

566
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Since Jinzhao doesn't like me calling him that,

567
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
I won't call him that anymore.

568
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Jinzhao won't let me ask him.

569
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
I won't ask him again.

570
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Little horse.

571
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
They're out.

572
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Let's go.

573
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Master Meng.

574
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
You're here.

575
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm relieved to see you two are safe.

576
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
The young hero has already punished the evil one.

577
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Although he's a bit of a playboy,

578
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
he was beaten away by us.

579
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,040
What?

580
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Thanks to you two.

581
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Master Meng.

582
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Did you tell us to join the Holy Family before?

583
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Of course.

584
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
You two are loyal to the Master.

585
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
You'll definitely be rewarded.

586
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Thank you, Master Meng.

587
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I have a small favor to ask.

588
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Please accept it.

589
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
What's this?

590
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Get up.

591
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
You're naughty.

592
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Master Meng.

593
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Master Meng.

594
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,040
We really want to join the Holy Family.

595
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
You two are so sensible.

596
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Come with me.

597
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Thanks.

598
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
I'll take care of it.

599
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
You too.

600
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
See you, guys.

601
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
The flowers are so strange.

602
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Don't scare me.

603
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
What if there's poison?

604
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
Let's go.

605
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Let's go.

606
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Sister.

607
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Look at these sculptures.

608
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
They look exactly like the real ones.

609
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
They're so strange.

610
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
The Holy Palace of the Ghost Valley.

611
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Each of these statues is different.

612
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
It's so fun.

613
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Don't touch it.

614
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,040
These are the disciples of the Holy Family.

615
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
They're all real people.

616
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Master Meng.

617
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Is this the flying voice of our Holy Family?

618
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Not everyone is qualified to fly.

619
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,040
We have to work harder than Gao Xiao and Si Zhao.

620
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Si Zhao?

621
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
What Si Zhao?

622
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
You don't know.

623
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Our Holy Family's leader is Sheng Xuan.

624
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Sheng Xuan passed the order of the leader to the master.

625
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:27,500
The master is the leader of the

626
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Holy Family.

627
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Please.

628
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
We found the mountain.

629
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Qi Yuan is so good.

630
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Master Meng is so good.

631
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Let's go.

632
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
I found you.

633
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Qi Yuan.

634
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
The flying fish.

635
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
What fish?

636
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
I'm so ignorant.

637
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
This is the ancient god Sheng Kun

638
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
that our Holy Family worshiped.

639
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Qi Yuan.

640
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
What's wrong?

641
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I feel like I'm familiar with it.

642
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
It's done.

643
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Master Meng.

644
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Why?

645
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
We didn't bother you.

646
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
You two have good martial arts.

647
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
But your brains?

648
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Master Meng.

649
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
We really want to join the Holy Family.

650
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Why did you lock us up?

651
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Miss.

652
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,040
You have to ask Master Sheng Xuan.

653
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Master Sheng Xuan?

654
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Zai Hui.

655
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
Master Meng.

656
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Master Meng.

657
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Master Meng.

658
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Jin Zhao.

659
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Why do I feel like he's bringing us here on purpose?

660
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I think so too.

661
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
But don't worry.

662
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Our wine is almost here.

663
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Master.

664
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Minister Si Zhao.

665
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Minister Si Zhao.

666
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Minister Si Zhao.

667
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,040
You bastard.

668
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
You're so mean.

669
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
You're cruel.

670
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Yes.

671
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
What's the matter?

672
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Take your time.

673
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Master Sheng Xuan asked me to catch those two.

674
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
I just took them here without any effort.

675
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
What?

676
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Slow down.

677
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
It's okay.

678
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
My legs are a little numb.

679
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Say it again.

680
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
What did you say?

681
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
I've got a reason to lock them up.

682
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
You're good.

683
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
I'll give you a lesson.

684
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,040
I'll report to Master Sheng Xuan.

685
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
Master Sheng Xuan.

686
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Stop looking.

687
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Gao Xiao.

688
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
We're here.

689
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
He...

690
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Didn't you say two people?

691
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
It's clearly three people.

692
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Aren't you that crazy bastard?

693
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
You...

694
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
You three are a couple.

695
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
You're lying to me, aren't you?

696
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
It's just a game of luck.

697
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Where are the others?

698
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Go after them.

699
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Go after them.

700
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I'll help you.

701
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
I'll help you.

702
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
You're unlucky to meet our Jia Qi.

703
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Please forgive me.

704
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
Please forgive me.

705
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Did you ever think about this

706
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
when you did those dirty things?

707
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Don't...

708
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Don't come over.

709
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Don't come over.

710
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
You...

711
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
You...

712
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
You...

713
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
You useless thing.

714
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Why are you panicking?

715
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,040
This Fu Jin Tang has been managing this for many years.

716
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
How can you be so wild?

717
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Today, I'm going to be wild to the end.

718
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Yin Zhuang.

719
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Qi.

720
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Yin Zhuang.

721
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Yin Zhuang.

722
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Miss Yue.

723
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
What did you do to Qi?

724
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
She...

725
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
She...

726
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
I...

727
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,040
I...

728
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
What?

729
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
What?

730
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
You can mix with the soul.

731
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
Master.

732
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Master has appeared.

733
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Master is here.

734
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Master.

735
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Did you see us in a difficult situation

736
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
and come out to guide us?

737
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
No.

738
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
I'm not the Master.

739
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm not the Master.

740
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Yin Zhuang, think of something.

741
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Qi.

742
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Jing Zhou.

743
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Jing Zhou.

744
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Jing Zhou.

745
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Jing Zhou.

746
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Jing Zhou.

747
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Jing Zhou, Jing Zhou.

748
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,160
You!

749
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Qi...

750
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,520
Qi, come back!

751
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,640
Tell me who you are!

752
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,660
Who do you think you are?

753
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,320
Don't kiss him!

754
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,000
Stop!

755
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,360
Do not kiss him!

756
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,020
Stop!

757
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,700
Don't kiss him!

758
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,200
Stop!

759
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,840
You can't get away with this.

760
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
You can't get away with this.

761
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,860
Round the world

762
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,500
Original star

763
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,580
Well, this Day

764
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,960
FlowingMicrorado

765
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,860
Burn once

766
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
is the secret of my heart.

767
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,200
The secret behind the mask

768
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
is only seen through my eyes.

769
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Who can see it?

770
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,200
It's destined that I'll put on a show for you.

771
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Even if the ending is hard to escape the fate,

772
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I will exchange a little bit of the light of the jade

773
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:18,200
for the unfulfilled promises of love.

774
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,200
The secret behind the mask

775
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,200
It seems like a random path,

776
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,200
burning traces,

777
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
hiding the secrets.

778
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,440
The plot of the

779
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
unexpected encounter

780
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
is all my little

781
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
arranged.

782
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,200
It's destined that I'll put on a show for you.

783
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Even if the ending is hard to escape the fate,

784
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,200
I will exchange a little bit of the light of the jade

785
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,200
for the unfulfilled promises of love.

786
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,200
It's destined that I'll do my best for you.

787
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Even if the ending is hard to escape the fate,

788
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I will exchange a little bit of the light of the jade

789
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,200
for the unfulfilled promises of love.
