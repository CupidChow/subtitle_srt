1
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:25,420


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:40,664
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,880
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,524
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,772
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,220
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,428
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:38,528
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,472
   

19
00:01:56,472 --> 00:02:00,036
   

20
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:18,040
Our honored guests have arrived.

21
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,384
My sincere welcome.

22
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:10,060
I have been waiting for your arrival, Commander Ying.

23
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,139
You can resonate with Rehai.

24
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,899
I imagine you're one of the guardians of the Nine Springs.

25
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:20,180
Which spring are you the guardian of?

26
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,044
Mist Soul.

27
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,859
I met Physician Bian some time ago

28
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,260
and I had many questions to ask.

29
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,739
You're here for...

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,960
I... came for Rehai.

31
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,559
Commander Ying, you really are direct.

32
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:53,700
I heard the Righteous Martial Alliance wiped out the Qiyuan Sect.

33
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,340
The disciples mistook Miss Yue for Lord Ming.

34
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,820
Not only that. Something unexpected happened.

35
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,440
You're very well-informed, Young Master Luo.

36
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,739
It seems that Luo Zhaoyan has already told you about this.

37
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,919
The Qiyuan Sect was giving out Qiyuan Orbs

38
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,739
for Lord Ming to absorb energy.

39
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,939
Now you've destroyed the Qiyuan Sect.

40
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,760
Is it because you've gathered enough Qiyuan Orbs?

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,980
Since you've guessed the answer, why bother asking?

42
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,912
Not so.

43
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,379
There are many things I still haven't figured out.

44
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,759
Like the story between the Hengdao Sect and the Sea of Clear Skies.

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,459
And why you, as the guardian of Mist Soul, are so interested in Rehai?

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,999
To achieve better collaboration, please answer my questions.

47
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,800
I hope... we can work well together.

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,119
This is... the key ring of Rehai?

49
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:35,960
This key ring of Rehai is an important item against Zhu Yu.

50
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:40,580
It's made from the dragon bone of Guixu.

51
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:46,539
Back then Shennong forged the Rehai key ring with dragon bone.

52
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:51,240
I duplicated it to confuse Zhu Yu.

53
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:58,200
Interesting... The key ring of Rehai can be copied.

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Cang Feng.

55
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,870
Keep it safe.

56
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:10,899
Cang Feng, you're also a guardian of Rehai now.

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,376
I appreciate it.

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,340
Next time we meet, we'll discuss how to deal with Zhu Yu.

59
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,000
I've agreed to side with you against Zhu Yu.

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,360
In exchange, shouldn't you show me some sincerity, Commander Ying?

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,059
I wonder if the way to remove the binding shows enough sincerity.

62
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,040
Of course, it can.

63
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,759
Bloodbinding the spring defies the will of heaven.

64
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,020
It can only be removed with the help of a kin's blood.

65
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,939
The closer the kin, the more likely it'll succeed.

66
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,379
Blood of a close kin.

67
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,860
There's yet another way.

68
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,400
The blood of the whole clan works the same.

69
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:38,639
Zhaoyan, you finally came back.

70
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,219
What's with that look?

71
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,059
Did you do something behind my back?

72
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:04,919
No, Maiming, Miss Ming needs a favor.

73
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,900
My master died.

74
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,860
I heard that the Nine Springs Dragon Pool can bring back the deceased.

75
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,819
I'd like to go there through Rehai.

76
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,180
Miss Luo, I'm hoping you'll help me.

77
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,288
Maiming.

78
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:29,919
The Dragon Pool has a sentry stationed there.

79
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,480
No one can enter easily.

80
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,300
Miss Ming, you don't look well.

81
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,219
Why don't you rest tonight and prepare to enter the Dragon Pool tomorrow?

82
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,664
Thank you.

83
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,000
Your friends have all settled in?

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,440
Thank you, Maiming.

85
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,979
I'll go see Xian Qing and the others now.

86
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,120
Zhaoyan, I need to speak with you.

87
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,859
You told the others about Rehai.

88
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:21,919
It seems that you consider them important partners now.

89
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,880
We've been through life and death. I trust them.

90
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,159
I don't trust anyone.

91
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,039
I only trust you.

92
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:49,939
You and that wolf demon... what's going on?

93
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:59,280
♫  One branch, two lifetimes of flowers  ♫

94
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,176
Zhaoyan,

95
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,380
I know you better than anyone in this world.

96
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,040
You can't hide it from me.

97
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,640
Maiming, I've never hid anything from you.

98
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,760
♫  Under the Chinese parasol tree  ♫

99
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,859
I don't know how I feel right now.

100
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
I've always said my time was limited,

101
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,299
I wanted to use that short time to help the Luo family thrive.

102
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,480
But now...

103
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,499
You have limited time because I took your life.

104
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,199
You disguised yourself as a man to protect me.

105
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,859
Do you really not resent this fate?

106
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,720
Don't you hate me?

107
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,176
Maiming.

108
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:06,160
I've always been steadfast in this.

109
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,800
I'd be lying if I said I'd never felt resentment.

110
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,500
But since it's decided that I can't live long,

111
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,200
I might as well focus on how to live a brilliant life.

112
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
It gives me more freedom to present myself as a man.

113
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,400
And I've made many friends.

114
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,100
I'm happy, Maiming. Really.

115
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Then...

116
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,820
The fact that you're a girl... they know already?

117
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,960
They promised to keep it a secret.

118
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,700
In that case,

119
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,500
I don't have to keep pretending either.

120
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,700
Zhaoyan, I have a gift for you.

121
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,700
A gift?

122
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,560
Appreciate orioles among the flowers.

123
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,600
Appreciate a beauty under the moon.

124
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
My sister is such a pretty girl.

125
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,600
Then, can I change back into my clothes?

126
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
I'm not really used to this.

127
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,200
The ceremony is coming. Our clan people are returning.

128
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,800
It's nothing weird to see a new face.

129
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,200
Why don't you experience life as a girl?

130
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,300
Or is it because you don't like my gift?

131
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
Fine then.

132
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,500
   

133
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,800
Zhaoyan?

134
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,400
Zhaoyan, I saw you.

135
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't come over here yet.

♫  Ripples appear again  ♫

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,700
Leave them alone.

162
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,000
Zhaoyan really is a girl.

163
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Didn't you know that awhile ago?

164
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm just not used to it.

165
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,600
I guess we can't call her Brother Luo anymore.

166
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,340
Let's just call her Zhaoyan.

167
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,100
You look beautiful.

168
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,180
Walk... with me.

169
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,348
   

170
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:19,680
Y-You're Miss Luo.

171
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,320
Since Zhaoyan trusts you,

172
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,440
I don't have to hide anything anymore.

173
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,599
I'm Luo Maiming.

174
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,080
"Miss Luo" became "Master Luo" out of the blue.

175
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,359
We have to get used to it.

176
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,759
Where is Zhaoyan?

177
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,080
She fell sick.

178
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,200
She's feeling unwell. She told me to get you into Rehai first.

179
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
How is she doing?

180
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
It's a chronic problem. She just needs some rest.

181
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,900
We know Zhaoyan.

182
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,300
She'd come to say goodbye even if she was sick.

183
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,160
I persuaded her to stay and rest.

184
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,808
What's wrong, Senior Uncle?

185
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
Why is Xian Qing gone?

186
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes, he was right behind us before.

187
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
I bet he has things to deal with.

188
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Let's head to the Dragon Pool first.

189
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Yes, let's take care of Senior Gu's issue first and meet them later.

190
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,100
Let's go.

191
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,400
Zhaoyan.

192
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Maiming! Maiming, what's going on?

193
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Yesterday... a distinguished guest visited.

194
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:49,360
Guess what he told me?

195
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,760
He told me how to remove the Bloodbinding.

196
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,720
Really?

197
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:07,700
Back then, I thought I needed to just sacrifice myself.

198
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,500
But I ended up in an eternal prison,

199
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,600
constantly reincarnated and borrowing life from others,

200
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
living like a walking dead.

201
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
I know that. I know, Maiming.

202
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,300
You have endured torture and suffering from the Luo family all these years.

203
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,500
Is there really a way out now?

204
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Yes, he said only the blood of the closest kin will work.

205
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,400
You... need my blood.

206
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,800
Zhaoyan, do you still remember

207
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,400
that you live and die with me?

208
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,500
I do. Of course.

209
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,000
But all you have to do is ask, Maiming.

210
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
Why did you chain me up?

211
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,800
Because you've changed.

212
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,000
You're not the same Zhaoyan anymore.

213
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,500
   

214
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,720
What's going on?

215
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,199
 Intruders. 

216
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Are you the sentry of the Dragon Pool?

217
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,400
We're with the guardian of Pureness and heading to the Dragon Pool.

218
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,300
Please let us pass.

219
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
 Guardian of Pureness? 

220
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,700
 There's darkness hidden deep down inside this guardian. 

221
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,900
What is this...

222
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
- Miss Ming. 
 - Sister Ming Xiu.

223
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,100
Qi, hold tight to me.

224
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:53,539
 Stay lost in the maze of memories forever. 

225
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,300
Where is Xian Qing and the others? You didn't hurt them, did you?

226
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,600
Even now, you're still thinking about him.

227
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,500
Where are they, Maiming?

228
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,600
Don't hurt them. Okay?

229
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,300
I shouldn't have let you go to Luori Village.

230
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,700
Giving that wolf demon a chance to approach you.

231
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,800
- So you're targeting... 
 - Yes.

232
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,300
I'll kill the wolf demon.

233
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Are you crazy, Maiming? Are you mad?

234
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,400
What? You're worried about him?

235
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
Maiming!

236
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,259
By the end of the day, you'll be back to how you were.

237
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,700
Xian Qing. Xian Qing, run! He's after you!

238
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,600
You're here.

239
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Maiming. Maiming...

240
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,900
Maiming... Maiming!

241
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,800
Xian Qing, hurry, go!

242
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,500
Luo Maiming, you've always cherished Zhaoyan.

243
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,900
And she's done a lot for you.

244
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,300
I'm the one you want. Why do you have to do this to her?

245
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,100
We've been keeping each other company for years.

246
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,200
But now she only cares about you.

247
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,000
In that case, I might as well kill her.

248
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,960
You want to kill her? Did I give you permission?

249
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Maiming! Maiming, let him go!

250
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,800
Xian Qing!

251
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
Maiming, please!

252
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,800
Maiming, please let him go!

253
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
I beg you, don't hurt him!

254
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,100
Xian Qing!

255
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,900
I-I'm here...

256
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,700
Xian Qing.

257
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,500
Wolf demon, if I apply a bit more pressure,

258
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,400
your life will be at risk.

259
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,700
Try again.

260
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Xian Qing...

261
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,700
Xian Qing.

262
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:18,405
Xian Qing!

263
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Mother, Uncle killed the demon already. 

264
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
 We're safe now. 

265
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,300
 Today... is... your birthday. 

266
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,600
 - I don't want to celebrate it. 
 - What a pity. 

267
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,100
 I only want you. 

268
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,040
 Mother... 

269
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,500
 Mother! 

270
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,200
 Mother! 

271
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,500
 Mother, wake up! 

272
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,600
 Wake up, Mother! 

273
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Is that Miss Ming's memory?

274
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:33,139
Judging from what the sentry said,

275
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:38,000
we have to find the way out of here through your memory.

276
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,700
Miss Ming, what happened after that?

277
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Sister Ming Xiu, avoiding it won't help.

278
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,599
Miss Ming, I don't know what happened back then,

279
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,200
but you were adopted by Senior Gu.

280
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
So your family...

281
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,600
What has happened won't fade away even if you choose to avoid it.

282
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,500
Shut up!

283
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,400
Miss Ming, earlier, when I was hiding in my room,

284
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,400
it was Senior Gu who told me to face everything with courage.

285
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,400
I think that's what he'd also say to you.

286
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,300
 Mother. 

287
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,800
 Mother... 

288
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,100
 Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? 

289
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,800
 Mother. 

290
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,600
 Mother. 

291
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,439
 Mother. 

292
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,120
Mother.

293
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,928
Master.

294
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:25,219
Now I understand why Ming Xiu hates demons so much.

295
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,240
That's why you never celebrate your birthday.

296
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,600
Sentry, we shouldn't have barged into the spring.

297
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,600
But we also have no choice.

298
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,600
Please stop your hurtful trick.

299
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
 This scene is from her memory. 

300
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,700
 I simply restored it. 

301
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,400
There are all kinds of memories.

302
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,000
Ming Xiu had so many nice memories with Uncle Gu.

303
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
Why didn't you show those?

304
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,700
You're just a monster who spies on people's secrets!

305
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,400
 Xiu'er. 

306
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,500
 You dreamed about your mother again? 

307
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,700
 Master, are there any spells to bring her back? 

308
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:30,179
 The best comfort for the deceased is to live well. 

309
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
 As long as the living inherit the wishes and beliefs of the deceased, 

310
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,700
 the deceased are in a sense resurrected, 

311
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,400
 and their lives continued. 

312
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,400
What happened?

313
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,616
Where are we now?

314
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,339
Sister Ming Xiu is gone.

315
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,400
Wh-What on earth is that?

316
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,600
- So ugly. 
  - Joy, sorrow, fury, happiness: the four human sufferings. 

317
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,000
 I appear in the shape of human memories. 

318
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,400
 How I look represents people's minds. 

319
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,100
Enough of that. Where's Miss Ming?

320
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,500
 The guardian of Pureness holds too deep an obsession 

321
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,400
 to leave the maze of memories. 

322
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,600
Let Sister Ming Xiu out.

323
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 If she remains immersed in it, no one can get her out. 

324
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,600
Xian Qing! Xian Qing!

325
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,720
Xian Qing!

326
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,700
So naive.

327
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,700
With your skills right now, I can crush you easily.

328
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,800
And you want to save her?

329
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,000
There's another way. Would you like to try it?

330
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,800
I heard... that the demons can't live without their demonic orbs,

331
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,700
it contains all their cultivated energy.

332
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,600
I'm so curious,

333
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,200
why don't you show me your orb?

334
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,830
Maiming! Maiming! Xian Qing, no!

335
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,500
Xian Qing!

336
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,100
No.

337
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The person who sets up the game is asking the pawn to make a choice?

338
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,679
The demonic orb and demonic power...

339
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
mean nothing to me.

340
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,100
If you want them, have them then.

341
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,439
Xian Qing...

342
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,000
To have someone to die for in this lifetime,

343
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:31,576
makes it worth it.

344
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,400
No, Xian Qing!

345
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:35,000
I heard that demons die very soon after they're depleted of their demonic orb.

346
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:47,160
Xian Qing... Xian Qing.

347
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Maiming... Maiming!

348
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Xian Qing!

349
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,200
Xian Qing!

350
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,439
Maiming! Maiming!

351
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,400
The removal of Bloodbinding is between you and me.

352
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,900
Are you planning to give up your life now?

353
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,300
You wanted my life, didn't you? Take it.

354
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,800
Why involve someone innocent?

355
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,300
So, right now, are you making this decision...

356
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:28,619
because of me or the wolf demon?

357
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,800
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

358
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,700
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

359
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,600
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

360
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,800
Maiming, even if it's not Xian Qing,

361
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,900
even if it was Brother Yue, Miss Yue, or our disciples here, I'd do my best to protect them.

362
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:57,160
The only one you're willing to abandon... is me.

363
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,479
Maiming, I never thought about breaking my promise.

364
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,099
As long as you don't hurt anyone.

365
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,600
Don't you want freedom? I'll help you.

366
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,300
I beg you, please don't hurt Xian Qing. Okay?

367
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,600
As long as you want, I'll be how I used to be.

368
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,600
Maiming.

369
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,500
Are you trying to trade your life for the wolf demon's life?

370
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,400
It's not a trade, Maiming. It's not a trade.

371
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I don't want you to make more mistakes.

372
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Maiming, as long as you want,

373
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,800
I'll be how I used to be.

374
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,200
I will protect you like I used to, Maiming.

375
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,700
♫  I'm lost in you  ♫

376
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,200
♫  Leaving everything behind, only to search for you  ♫

♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

379

♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

380

Maiming.

381
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,959
Xian Qing. Xian Qing.

382
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,300
Xian Qing.

Leave.

390
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Maiming.

391
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Go back to your friends.

392
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,900
Never come back to the Luo family.

393
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,808
Maiming...

394
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,300
Get lost.

395
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:35,200
