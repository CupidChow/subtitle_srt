62

Why are we so unlucky?

63
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,799
So it's you two.

64
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:30,280
- The prey just...  
 - delivered themselves right to us.

65
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,160
You two were lucky to escape just now.

66
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,962
Now your good luck has run out!

67
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,559
The ones who fled in a panic last time weren't us.

68
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:43,909
Let me tell you. This lake is where I breed stingrays.

69
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:48,059
You can't be arrogant today.

70
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,619
What sorcery is this?

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,900
Qi.

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,280

 - I'm fine.

74
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,559
Find a chance to run and get Brother Luo for help.

But...

76
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,479
Go!

77
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,589

 - Go!

78

82
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,539
Demon. This lady is a demon!

83
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,339
Stay calm.

84
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,499
Stay calm.

85
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,299
W-We should show them some mercy and not go overboard.

86
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,000
Right? Let's retreat for now.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,160
Go, go, go.

88
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,280
Go. Go.

89
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,860
Let's go.

91
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,020

Don't scare me. Jinzhao.

93

94
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,600
Master. Master!

95
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,000
Master Luo, don't worry. My master is right here.

96
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Okay.

97
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,200
Master.

98
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,000
Master, don't be hasty to test me. Xian Qing is injured.

99
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,404
   

100
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,700
Xian Qing is injured again?

101
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,700
Bring him inside.

102
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
My master will treat him.

103
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,000
Master Luo, I'll escort you back first.

104
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,400
Okay, I'll just wait at the door.

105
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,500
Senior, we're now at Mount Yuqing.

106

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 Senior, you must get well soon. 

111
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Master, how is he?

112
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,400
Didn't you always say one as irritating as him could live a long time?

113
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,100
Master!

114
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,300
He's exhausted his energy. He probably won't wake up anytime soon.

115
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,100
Even if he wakes up, his power is likely to be greatly reduced.

116

Jinzhao...

117

wake up.

How did he get himself into such a terrible situation?

150
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,200
He encountered someone with half of his energy.

151
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
He was seriously injured while protecting him with all his might.

152
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,400
It's Luo Wangping's child?

153
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I see.

154
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Back then, Luo Wangping promised to exchange his life for half of Xian Qing's energy.

155
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,800
But in the end, he broke his promise.

156
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
Later, when Xian Qing was weak,

157
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,300
he was attacked by a beast and nearly lost his life.

158
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,900
We didn't expect after 20 years, he would meet the child of the Luo family.

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Forget this for now, let's go look for herbs.

Qi... I've caused you trouble this time.

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,500
No. You haven't. Don't talk nonsense.

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,700
I'm a bit sleepy.

164
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,200
Jinzhao, don't sleep.

165
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,700
You can't sleep.

166
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,700
If you fall asleep, I'll take away all your money.

167
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,300
And the little fish jade pendant. I'll pawn it off.

168
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,200
Don't go.

169
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,800
You mustn't pawn it.

170
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,300
♫  In this lifetime, I will only ever care for one person  ♫

171
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,570
♫  No matter how many lifetimes pass, that fate will never be fulfilled  ♫

172
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,300
♫  Afraid of the vast ocean  ♫

173
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,800
Okay, then promise me, you won't sleep.

174
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,600
Okay...

175
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
♫  Afraid of not recognizing you when we meet again  ♫

176
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,000
♫  Afraid of dreams, of parting  ♫

177
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,200
♫  Afraid of having to break promises  ♫

178
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,600
♫  Afraid we'll lose each other forever in one moment  ♫

179
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,700
♫  Afraid after reincarnation we'll search everywhere  ♫

180
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,600
♫  yet pass by each other  ♫

181
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,900
I can't believe I have your energy.

182
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,700
No wonder every time you transfer your energy to me,

183
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,500
it feels so familiar.

184
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,100
 Young Zhaoyan. 

185
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,100
 It's been a long time since I saw someone so innocent. 

186
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,400
 You're quite adorable. 

187
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,900
 We didn't expect after 20 years, he would meet the child of the Luo family. 

188
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,100
You always say I'm naive,

189
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,800
but I think you're the naive one.

190
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,000
You just gave half of your power and energy to a stranger.

191
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,200
♫  Afraid of not being able to say goodbye  ♫

192
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,600
♫  Afraid there's only longing left in the memories  ♫

193
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,600
♫  Afraid of not recognizing you when we meet again  ♫

194
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,000
♫  Afraid of dreams, of parting  ♫

195
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,100
♫  Afraid of having to break promises  ♫

196
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,600
♫  Afraid we'll lose each other forever in one moment  ♫

197
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,100
Our Luo family fulfills its promises and repays kindness from others.

198
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,200
I will now return your energy.

199
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,000
♫  Longing for wishes to come true, to meet again  ♫

200
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,200
♫  Longing for us to be side by side in this life and the next  ♫

201
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
♫  Longing for the moon to rise again  ♫

202
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,700
♫  Longing to be in each other's hearts the moment we meet again  ♫

203
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,900
♫  Longing to see you again for the first time  ♫

204
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,900
It seems this medicine isn't needed.

205
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Your senior uncle is used to always giving.

206
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,000
He probably never thought that someone would return his energy.

207
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,500
He's magnanimous and worthy of being the Master of the Luo Family.

208
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,200
Senior Uncle's concern hasn't been in vain, then.

209
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,400
It's late. Go back early and rest.

210
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,600
I'll go to see Brother Yue.

211
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,100
Master! I'll go with you.

212
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,500
Okay, watch your step.

213
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,900
You really are lucky.

214
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,900
Let us handle it.

215
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,500
There are internal injuries.

216
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,000
But there's no immediate danger to life.

217
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
Miss Shuo Xuan.

218
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,100
Our Hengdao Sect and your Sea of Clear Skies have an agreement.

219
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,900
Right now, Qi and Yue Jinzhao are under our care.

220
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,700
Why do you keep following them?

221
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,800
May I ask your intentions?

222
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,600
This is how you take care of them?

223
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,700
They're already badly injured.

224
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
No wonder Her Lordship doesn't trust you.

225
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,000
Please go back and tell her,

226
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
right now, Qi and Yue Jinzhao are undergoing trials.

227
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,200
Everything is under our control. There's no need to worry.

228
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
Someone's coming.

229
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Young Huan, let's go.

230
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
Let's go.

231
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,100
Master, they're over there!

232
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm sorry.

233
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,100
 Young Zhaoyan gave me back my energy. 

234
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
Young Zhaoyan.

235
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
You've returned my energy to me.

236
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,900
How will you sustain yourself?

237
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,000
Your energy...

238
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,200
can only make me stronger, but can't extend my life.

239
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
In your hands,

240
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
it can be of more use.

241
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,000
Young Zhaoyan,

242
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,500
what on earth do you want?

243
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,500
Today, I coincidentally learned...

244
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
twenty years ago,

245
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
my father once had a deal with you.

246
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,100
It turns out that when I was young,

247
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,000
I had already received your kindness.

248
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,800
But my father failed to fulfill his promise.

249
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
This half of your energy...

250
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,600
should be returned to you.

251
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
For thousands of years,

252
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,700
countless people have asked me for my energy.

253
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,200
I don't care if they can return it.

254
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,200
You're the first one to return my energy to me.

255
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,300
Young Zhaoyan,

256
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,000
you returned my energy...

257
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,900
just to repay a debt?

258
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,400
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

259
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,200
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

260
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,300
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

261
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,600
A son should settle...

262
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
his father's debts.

263
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,400
♫  In the vast sea of people, just one glance and I'm lost in you  ♫

264
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,800
♫  My heart can't help but draw closer to you  ♫

265
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
♫  Seeking a perfect ending  ♫

266
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
♫  If love arises with the wind  ♫

267
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,600
♫  How do I calm it?  ♫

268
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,120
♫  I've done my best  ♫

269
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,300
♫  But our paths just won't cross  ♫

270
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,900
Young Zhaoyan.

271
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,060
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

272
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,900
Are you doing this to sever ties with me?

273
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,800
You became weak... because you gave your energy to me.

274
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
And today, you almost lost your life because of it.

275
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,700
I feel guilty. I'm unworthy...

276
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,000
But I don't care about my energy or how long I can live.

277
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,300
I do!

278
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,900
♫  One word from you and I'm lost in you  ♫

279
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,600
Senior,

280
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
I care.

281
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,600
♫  Seeking a perfect ending  ♫

282
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,100
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

283
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,000
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

284
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,800
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

285
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Life in this world is like a fleeting moment.

286
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,600
What does it matter if one lives for an instant or for 1,000 years?

287
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,300
Life is precious regardless of its length.

288
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,700
Senior,

289
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,600
please don't take life...

290
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,400
so lightly anymore.

291
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
I won't.

292
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,300
 Zhaoyan, 

293
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,500
 do you know losing the demonic power will make your body even weaker? 

294
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,500
I don't want to owe others.

295
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,000
Besides, I've already had it for 20 years.

296
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,600
 Maiming, I don't want to argue over this with you. 

297
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,400
All right.

298
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,300
I'll say something you'll want to hear.

299
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,400
The Righteous Martial Alliance has annihilated Qiyuan's Jiangning stronghold.

300
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,300
I'm also very concerned about Bian Luohuan's escape.

301
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,600
I'll go to the Righteous Martial Alliance immediately and see if there are new clues.

302
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,100
Is that funny?

303
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,200
As expected of Young Zhaoyan.

304
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,600
 Once I mention the Qiyuan Sect, you immediately perk up. 

305
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Since you've already returned the demonic power, be sure to take care of yourself.

306
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,900
Young Zhaoyan.

307
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,000
You're so eager to make great achievements as head of the Luo Family.

308
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
This time, you were heavily drained.

309
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,600
I got you some medicine to replenish your energy. Take care of yourself.

310
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Thank you.

311
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Before you went down the mountain to travel with Xiu'er,

312
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
I divined a fortune for you.

313
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,600
The divination showed that you'd face a love tribulation.

314
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,300
A love tribulation?

315
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,800
Whether it's a calamity or fate isn't certain yet.

316
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,700
It seems you are serious this time.

317
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,000
For thousands of years, you've been playing around in the world.

318
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,600
I've never seen you take someone so seriously.

319
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,100
It might be... because I've never met such a special lady.

320
00:36:50,290 --> 00:37:00,280


321
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,400
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

322
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,500
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

323
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,800
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

324
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,400
♫  Behind the mask are deep feelings  ♫

325
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,300
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

326
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,400
♫  Who can see them clearly?  ♫

327
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:01,300
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

328
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:09,500
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

329
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:17,500
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

330
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,500
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

331
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,500
♫  Seemingly random paths  ♫

332
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,400
♫  Traces of what's been burned  ♫

333
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,400
♫  Concealing all the secrets  ♫

334
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,500
♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

335
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:11,400
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫

336
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:19,400
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

337
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:27,500
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

338
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:35,400
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

339
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:43,600
♫  Leaving love with an unspoken explanation  ♫

340
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:51,500
♫  I'm destined to give my all for you  ♫

341
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:59,500
♫  Even if all my efforts go up in smoke  ♫

342
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:07,600
♫  Regardless of everything, I will love you deeply forever  ♫

343
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:17,000
♫  Leave behind evidence that my love existed  ♫
