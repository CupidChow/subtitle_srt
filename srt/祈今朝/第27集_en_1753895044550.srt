00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
젊 всем鄉居民, Zen少寨 !

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't want to leave regrets behind

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I will give up my whole life to exchange for another

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I decide to give up my life

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who will I give my heart to?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not afraid of being destroyed if I dare to give it to you

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't want to fall asleep

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I hope there will be no regrets in winter

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't regret it even if we don't have the same way

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:19,580
Because you are the

11
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,580
I'm willing to give up my life for you

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,580
Search for a miracle that will last forever

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,580
I will never give up on my journey

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:37,580
Love is the most beautiful meaning in life

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,580
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Episode 16

17
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Murderer!

18
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,580
Man Ming

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Man Ming

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Congratulations

21
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Man Ming

22
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
The murderer

23
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
It's you

24
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
You killed my father

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Don't come over

26
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:44,580
My Zhao Yan is a naive and honest fool

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,580
Man Ming

28
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,580
You are Zhao Yan

29
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,580
You are on the same side

30
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,580
It's you

31
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,580
You killed my father's brother

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
You are the murderer

33
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Kill him

34
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,580
Kill him

35
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Kill him

36
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,580
Take him away

37
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Okay, hold on

38
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,580
Hold on

39
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,580
Don't run

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Man Ming

41
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
Man Ming

42
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,580
Hold on

43
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,580
Man Ming

44
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
Man Ming

45
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Man Ming

46
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,580
Man Ming

47
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Man Ming

48
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Man Ming

49
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Don't die

50
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Man Ming

51
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Fool

52
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,580
I worked so hard to drive you out of the Luo family

53
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,580
Just because of what they said

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Why are you so stupid?

55
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,580
You are so disobedient

56
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm not disobedient

57
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Man Ming is my only family

58
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,580
I will listen to you

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,580
I won't let you die

60
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Man Ming, you can't die

61
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,580
Don't cry

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,580
I worked so hard to drive you out of the Luo family

63
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,580
I won't let you die

64
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,580
I won't let you die

65
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,580
I won't let you die

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,580
I won't let you die

67
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,580
No

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
Man Ming, you can't die

69
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,580
You can't die

70
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I have the power to save you

71
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Right?

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
Fool

73
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
Fool

74
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
I'm still alive

75
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,580
It's you

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,580
No

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,580
No

78
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
No

79
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Although I have left the hell

80
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,580
I can only wish you a happy life

81
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,580
Zhao Yan

82
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
The Luo family's fate

83
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,580
It's finally over

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Man Ming

85
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm so tired

86
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,580
I want to rest for a while

87
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
No

88
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
Man Ming

89
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,580
Man Ming

90
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Man Ming

91
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,580
Man Ming

92
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,220
I...

93
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Why did you come back?

94
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,940
According to the original plan,

95
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,980
we should find a temporary shelter in the remote village.

96
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,900
After the storm,

97
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,340
we'll come back to find the master.

98
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,700
My life is less than three days.

99
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,820
If so,

100
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,460
I'd rather die in the place I should die.

101
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,100
Do you really feel satisfied

102
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,940
as long as you die?

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,340
I think I'm a greedy person.

104
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Very greedy.

105
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,460
When the time comes,

106
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,180
I'll give the letter to him.

107
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,300
Give the letter to him.

108
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,780
The words are like flowers in the world.

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,780
The moon is like a flash of light.

110
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,180
May you be the most beautiful in the world.

111
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,220
See you, Lan Sheng.

112
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,140
See you, Lan Sheng.

113
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,100
My life has been entangled by the weather for many years.

114
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,180
When I was trying to get rid of the blood of the hot sea,

115
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,420
I forced the end of the relationship

116
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,100
to stop Zhao Yan from getting hurt.

117
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,460
I've never fallen in love with anyone.

118
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,460
Take care.

119
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,780
Take care.

120
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,940
Take care.

121
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,740
This is the secret room of Man Ming.

122
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,820
I've never been in here.

123
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,820
This...

124
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,220
Isn't this the flower I drew?

125
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
Come in.

126
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,180
My flower

127
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,100
is observed by my master.

128
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,300
The flowers you sent

129
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,400
of approval is that I'm very righteous.

130
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,820
When P En's heart was red,

131
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,160
his heart was red-hearted.

132
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,860
Unfortunately,

133
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,060
it was not like me.

134
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
I thought...

135
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,740
You...

136
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,140
You go to see him.

137
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,740
Lai Sheng.

138
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,380
I want to see the world with you.

139
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,340
Lai Sheng.

140
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay.

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,980
Lai Sheng.

142
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,380
Where did you go?

143
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,140
I didn't came back yet.

144
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,260
I dreamed of the incident

145
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,300
when the Luo family

146
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,420
was taught about the hot sea.

147
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,100
Nanming's soul

148
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,020
was trapped here forever.

149
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,980
I will always save her.

150
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,940
She will die soon.

151
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,060
I told Nanming

152
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,780
that I would save her.

153
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,620
I...

154
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,940
I would die with her.

155
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,780
Why does she

156
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,460
always refuse to believe me?

157
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,260
After a long time,

158
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,540
you suddenly met someone

159
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,380
who would rather give up his life

160
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,540
than give up your life.

161
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,180
So,

162
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,740
you had to

163
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
punish Shu Fa.

164
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,140
Luo Nanming,

165
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,700
you were in a hurry to get rid of Xue Fu.

166
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
Maybe it's just for me.

167
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,980
Luo Nanming

168
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,580
can keep saving lives.

169
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,380
But I, Luo Zhao Yan,

170
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,540
only have one life.

171
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,100
I said I killed so many people.

172
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,620
I was so stupid.

173
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,620
But in this world,

174
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,900
I am the only one

175
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,700
who has no right to hold her back.

176
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,380
Xingqin,

177
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,900
I don't know what to do.

178
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
In that case,

179
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,380
I will spend the rest of my life

180
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,860
to atone for her.

181
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Forgive me.

182
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,020
Forgive me.

183
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,780
Forgive me.

184
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,500
Can you?

185
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,420
I can.

186
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,020
Zhao Yan,

187
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,740
I will atone for your sins.

188
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,220
I have something to do.

189
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,340
But I want to go alone.

190
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,980
I know you want to go with me.

191
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,260
But this is the last thing

192
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,420
that belongs to the Luo family.

193
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,740
I want to do it myself.

194
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,060
Okay.

195
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,460
Did you see that?

196
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
The rest of the people of the Luo family are dead.

197
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,620
It's all because of this person.

198
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,100
Isn't the life of the Luo family always good?

199
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,740
It's changed since the day of the Mo family's great victory.

200
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,300
I heard that she killed hundreds of people.

201
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,660
Hundreds of people?

202
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,100
She is a demoness.

203
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,140
Why is she here?

204
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,860
What for?

205
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,820
Go.

206
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,620
Go.

207
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,340
She must be here for a good cause.

208
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,340
Luo Zhao Yan,

209
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,140
what are you doing here?

210
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,020
This...

211
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,620
This is not what we did.

212
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,140
This...

213
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,340
It was the people who were killed by you

214
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,260
who came here to kill us.

215
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,540
Don't worry.

216
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,460
I won't hurt you.

217
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,700
Besides,

218
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,460
I won't stay in your house anymore.

219
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,540
I...

220
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,900
I'm afraid that people will say that I'm a chicken.

221
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,740
What is this?

222
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,500
What is this?

223
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,340
What is this?

224
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,220
What is this?

225
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,060
What is this?

226
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,900
What is this?

227
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
What is this?

228
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
What is this?

229
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
What is this?

230
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,900
What is this?

231
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
What is this?

232
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
What is this?

233
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
What is this?

234
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Everyone,

235
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I am the former owner of the Luo family,

236
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
Luo Zhao Yan.

237
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,380
Today,

238
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,300
I would like to ask everyone here

239
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,500
to help me to testify.

240
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,700
From today on,

241
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,660
all the property that I and Mai Ming Ming have

242
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,500
belongs to the shopkeepers and the workers.

243
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Really?

244
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,900
And the property that we have

245
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
is also yours.

246
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,900
Please help me to sell it

247
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
and make up for the loss of the victim's family.

248
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Today,

249
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,300
I am here.

250
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,100
If you have any grudges or hatred,

251
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
just tell me.

252
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,300
Don't hurt the innocent.

253
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,300
The one who is the victim

254
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
is only me, Luo Zhao Yan.

255
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,700
My mother said that you are a murderer.

256
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Kill him.

257
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,700
Kill him.

258
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,500
I'll kill you.

259
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Kill him.

260
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Kill him.

261
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,300
Kill him.

262
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Kill him.

263
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Kill him.

264
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Kill him.

265
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Kill him.

266
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Kill him.

267
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
That's enough.

268
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,840
You're the best I ever held on to,

269
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,080
Yes, yes.

270
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,740
How is everything,

271
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,020
You had them是我自由

272
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,820
Lets not think about

273
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,160
what you did.

274
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,080
I really wanted that

275
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,100
and the Wei Conos

276
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,220
are good.

277
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,540
He has given me freedom now,

278
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,360
he used those three days

279
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,160
to get to his promise,

280
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,260
Carry on!

281
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
생겼어

282
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,180
Go

283
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,420
Thanks

284
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,940
Others may fall for it

285
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,820
What about me

286
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,940
Why ?

287
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
What's going on?

288
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
What's going on?

289
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
What's going on?

290
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
What's going on?

291
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
What's going on?

292
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,220
I'll

293
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
forgive you for this for the rest of my life.

294
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
From now on,

295
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
I won't report to the Tazu Camp.

296
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Yes.

297
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
The Mo Man Min of the Tujin Clan

298
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
and Luo Zhao Yan

299
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
have no shame to come back here.

300
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
All of you

301
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
are the blood of your ancestors.

302
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Luo Zhao Yan,

303
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
you are ruthless.

304
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
You are not related to the beast of the Ten-Handed Bone.

305
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
You are a human.

306
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Get out of here.

307
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

308
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
It's not your fault.

309
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
Let's go.

310
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Luo Zhao Yan,

311
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I hate you.

312
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I hate you.

313
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
I hate you.

314
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Zhao Yan,

315
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
what are you going to do in the future?

316
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I don't regret it.

317
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,500
But I still have a way to go.

318
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
So,

319
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I'll try to do more good things

320
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
to make up for my sins.

321
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I just want you

322
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
to be happy.

323
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
No matter how the world sees you,

324
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I will always be with you.

325
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I will always be with you.

326
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Qi,

327
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
where are you?

328
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Yan Xun

329
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Brother Yue.

330
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Sit.

331
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Brother Yue,

332
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I made you worried for the past two days.

333
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Miss Yue is missing.

334
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
But you were implicated

335
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
and can't find her.

336
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,500
I'm sorry that I couldn't ask for the clue in time.

337
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
The Luo family has been in a disaster.

338
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You can be separated from them.

339
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Besides, I've been looking for it for the past two days.

340
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
I couldn't find the location of the jade scroll.

341
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
So, it doesn't matter where I stay.

342
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
You and Miss Yue have a connection.

343
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
Can't you feel where the other person is?

344
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Yes.

345
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Yes.

346
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I've tried it.

347
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,500
The connection between Qi and me seems to be blocked by some kind of external force.

348
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
It should be the hand-pulled by Yin Xunwei.

349
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
De'er.

350
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
De'er.

351
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Do you see my De'er?

352
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
De'er.

353
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Do you see my De'er?

354
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Uncle, who is De'er?

355
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
Who is he?

356
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
You didn't see it either.

357
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
De'er.

358
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
De'er.

359
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
It must be the Luo family's secret.

360
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Otherwise,

361
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Uncle Nian treated his grandson well.

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Why did he suddenly turn into a stone man a few days ago?

363
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Brother,

364
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
except for that person's grandson,

365
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
there are other people who turned into stones?

366
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
How do you know?

367
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Does this really have something to do with you?

368
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Don't talk about it when you wake up.

369
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Don't talk about it.

370
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm not afraid of them hurting you.

371
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Let's go.

372
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Go.

373
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Although the Qiyuan Sect headquarters has been destroyed,

374
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
there will be a chance of being lost.

375
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
The original Luo family had great power in this generation.

376
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
How much can we shoot them down?

377
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
Now,

378
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
this must be related to Heng Daozhong.

379
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
We'd better send a letter to Chief Zuo

380
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
to ask Zhenwu Alliance to help protect the people of Yinghui Castle.

381
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Let him and us find the whereabouts of Heng Daozhong together.

382
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Your name is Yue Jinzhao?

383
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Someone asked me to give you this letter.

384
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
It's the seven-day moon pendant.

385
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Suo He Mountain.

386
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I've never heard of this place.

387
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
But since the other person has already sent a letter,

388
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
why don't you try again?

389
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
You have the ability to read the mind.

390
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
I think

391
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I've made it.

392
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I think I've made it.

393
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I'll send a letter to the other person.

394
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
Let him and Xiao Shi Guang meet us.

395
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,720
The

396
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Why did Heng Daozhong give a place that no one knew?

397
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
And deliberately cut off the connection between you and Xiao Yue.

398
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
It seems that he deliberately wants to lead us there.

399
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
They want to see

400
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
whether I can still find the letter

401
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
with the help of the new connection.

402
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
I'll go with you.

403
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
What's going on?

404
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,500
The connection letter

405
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
seems to have failed again.

406
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Jinzhao.

407
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Shi Guang.

408
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Jinzhao.

409
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Isn't it enough?

410
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
It doesn't matter.

411
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
If you need it,

412
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
we can help you.

413
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It's useless.

414
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
How can I do it?

415
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
There is a connection letter.

416
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Only

417
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I have a relationship with Qi.

418
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,500
I can't do it.

419
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Only

420
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
I have a relationship with Qi.

421
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
This time

422
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
I have to rely on myself.

423
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Jinzhao.

424
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
We must have other ways.

425
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Don't hurt yourself.

426
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
At the moment

427
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
if it still doesn't work,

428
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
even if you turn the sacred ball over

429
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
and turn it over,

430
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I must find Qi.

431
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I found it.

432
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I found it.

433
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I heard about

434
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
what happened within a few days.

435
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I didn't expect...

436
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
It doesn't matter, Miss Mei Xiu.

437
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Thank you for your concern.

438
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I've decided

439
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
to go back to the capital

440
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
and live in the capital

441
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
with you.

442
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll go with you.

443
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
I'll go with you.

444
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
I'll go with you.

445
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I'll go with you.

446
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,500
I'll go with you.

447
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
I'll go with you.

448
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
I've decided

449
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
to live on

450
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
with the effort

451
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
of the life of the victims.

452
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
I understand.

453
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Xiaoxiu.

454
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Did you bring the things

455
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I asked you to bring?

456
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Thank you.

457
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Take your medicine.

458
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Here.

459
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
These are the spirit pills

460
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
that Master has made for you.

461
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
If you give the cultivation

462
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
to others again,

463
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
you'll be beaten back

464
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
one day sooner or later.

465
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Zhao Yan likes

466
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
my fur coat.

467
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
If it's really that day,

468
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Zhao Yan will take me in.

469
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
No problem.

470
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
It's just

471
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
I'm poor and white now.

472
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
If you follow me in the future,

473
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I may only be able to eat vegetarian food.

474
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I eat a lot of meat.

475
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
It's good to eat vegetarian food.

476
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Jinzhao.

477
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Why did Heng Daozhong

478
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
arrest Xiaoyue?

479
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Maybe it's because Zhu Yu

480
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
had a bad relationship

481
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
with Heng Daozhong.

482
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
So Heng Daozhong

483
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
took her as a hostage.

484
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Jiuchuan,

485
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Heng Daozhong,

486
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
and the Sea of Heaven,

487
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
they are all like a mystery

488
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
that surrounds me and Qi.

489
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
To solve all these mysteries,

490
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I can only ask Ying Xuwei.

491
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Look!

492
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
There's a city floating in the air!

493
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Please wait for me.

494
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
It's really like the mortal world.

495
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
It's not as fast as falling,

496
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
but it's the end of the human world.

497
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
What a surprise!

498
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
So the food was also in the air.

499
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
No, no, no.

500
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
You don't know.

501
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
This city

502
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
is not floating by magic and energy,

503
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
but by mechanism.

504
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
You're quite knowledgeable.

505
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Where's Qi?

506
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
I want to see Qi.

507
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
If you want to see someone,

508
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
you have to pass me first.

509
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Didn't you call us here?

510
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Why are you still fighting?

511
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Who taught you

512
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
to hurt my three brothers like this?

513
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm going to beat you up.

514
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Xiaoyuan,

515
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
how did you explain to your brother when you came out?

516
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Do you still want to be punished by your brother?

517
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
The boss has something to say

518
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
to Yue Jingzhao and Yue Qi.

519
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
You can go to the guest room with him.

520
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
You want to stop us?

521
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Xiaoxiu,

522
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Ji Lai is a person who takes responsibility for safety.

523
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
We have to believe in Jingzhao and Xiaoyue.

524
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Lead the way.

525
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Follow me.

526
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
He's in there.

527
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Jingzhao.

528
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
I'm here.

529
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm here.

530
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
I'm here.

531
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm here.

532
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
I'm here.

533
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I'm here.

534
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
I'm here.

535
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
I'm here.

536
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm here.

537
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
I'm here.

538
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I'm here.

539
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
I'm here.

540
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm here.

541
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I'm here.

542
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
I'm here.

543
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I'm here.

544
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
I'm here.

545
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I'm here.

546
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm here.

547
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm here.

548
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
I'm here.

549
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
I'm here.

550
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm here.

551
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
I'm here.

552
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
I'm here.

553
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I'm here.

554
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm here.

555
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
I'm here.

556
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm here.

557
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Everything is unforgettable, I can't forget you

558
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,500
The past is a scene, how many smiles and tears

559
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Will all be gone

560
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,500
I'm looking for you in the mountains and rivers

561
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,500
The wind and mountains are alone with my back

562
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,500
The city is so clear, I'm fascinated by your figure

563
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I will never leave you

564
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,500
I'm looking for you in the mountains and rivers

565
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,500
The wind and mountains are alone with my back

566
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,500
The rain is slowly pouring down on your heart

567
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Don't doubt that I'm the one

568
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
You smelly gold bracelet, why are you here now?

569
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,500
It's my fault, I let you stay here for so long

570
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
How is it? Did they make it hard for you?

571
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Yes

572
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
You two, boss has been waiting for you for a long time

573
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Don't you want to know your own background?

574
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Then come with me

575
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,500
The shooting star in the sky

576
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Burned the past

577
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Forgotten the name

578
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,500
The depth behind the mask

579
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Only through my eyes

580
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Can you see

581
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It's destined to be a long game for you

582
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:57,500
Even if the ending is hard to escape

583
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I don't want to exchange a little bit of time

584
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
The fruit of memory

585
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Leave a silent description to love

586
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:21,500
It seems to be a random path

587
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,500
The traces of burning

588
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,500
Hiding the secrets

589
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,500
The traces of burning

590
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Hiding the secrets

591
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,500
The plot of unexpected encounter

592
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
It's all my idea

593
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Arrangement

594
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:07,500
It's destined to be a long game for you

595
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Even if the ending is hard to escape

596
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,500
I don't want to exchange a little bit of time

597
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,500
The fruit of memory

598
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Leave a silent description to love

599
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:39,500
It's destined to be a long game for you

600
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Even if the ending is hard to escape

601
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:56,500
It's destined to be a long game for you

602
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Leave a silent description to love
