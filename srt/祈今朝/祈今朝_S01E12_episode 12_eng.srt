 Miracle - JS 

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,700
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,000
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,500
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,900
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,100
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,400
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,300
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

19
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,500
   

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,110
   

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
   

22
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,200
Qiyuan Sect is really wicked.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,100
The ones who got fooled are also foolish.

24
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,200
They're so naive to think worshiping will automatically result in good fortune.

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
    
 Qiming, Hall Leader Ju has come back.

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,000
I saw him, Qianjun. Among the Righteous Martial Alliance's hall leaders,

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,900
- he's the only one who hasn't fought and won. 
 -  Right.

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,000
He doesn't deserve to be a hall leader.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
I thought Mechanic Skill Hall was long gone.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,700
Qianjun. Qiming.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Shifang is a fellow disciple and a hall leader. Don't be rude.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,300
Yes, Hall Leader Wen.

33
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,900
You are dismissed.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,900
- Shifang. 
 - A'Yang.

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,700
It has been a long time. I need to visit Lv Dazhi now.

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,400
You take good care of the guests. I'll buy you drinks when I get back.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
I take my leave.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
Shifang,

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
this man seems quite generous and righteous.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
As Brave Martial Hall's hall leader, A'Yang is friendly,

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,000
and he is also my best friend in the Righteous Martial Alliance.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,900
Xu Qiming and Chen Qianjun are from his hall.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,600
Shifang, how many people are there in your Mechanic Skill Hall?

44
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:27,559
I'm the only one right now.

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
That means few people are good at making mechanisms these days.

46
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,300
Shifang, I think you're amazing.

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Thank you, Young Yue.

48
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,500
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,700
Your Righteous Martial Alliance seems...

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,400
- How's it? It's pretty good. 
 - Pretty good.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,600
- Over there, up ahead. 
 - Up ahead?

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
Hurry up.

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Zhaoyan, it has been a long time. We missed you so much.

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
So did I.

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,200
It seems Young Zhaoyan doesn't miss us.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,300
Senior, you still like to joke.

57
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Brother Luo, why weren't you there?

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
I heard the disturbance outside earlier,

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,700
but I'm not a member of the Righteous Martial Alliance, so I waited here.

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,700
I didn't expect such a thing to happen.

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,800
We must eliminate the Qiyuan Sect right away.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Welcome to the Righteous Martial Alliance.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,700
Miss Ming Xiu, how's your master?

64
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you for your concern, he is all well.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,000
Alliance Leader, they are my friends I mentioned in the letter.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Young Yue, Jinzhao, and Senior Xian Qing.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,500
I have known you three from Shifang's letters.

68
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,600
Recently, I've also heard of your heroic deeds from Master Luo.

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,400
It's an honor to meet you today.

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
You flatter us.

71
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,300
Shifang.

72
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,280
You've been gone for so long and just sent only two letters.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm sorry, Alliance Leader.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,500
Alliance Leader Zuo, Shifang has been helping us on this journey.

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Right. We destroyed the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect in Luori Village.

76
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,900
Shifang has indeed made a great contribution.

77
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
Really?

78
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,800
It seems Shifang has made great progress on this journey.

79
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,500
Dear heroes, please try the iced plum soup, which is a specialty in Jing'an

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,700
and perfect for relieving the heat. Please enjoy.

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
Refreshing.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,700
Take it slow.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,300
Miss Yue, if you like it, you can have...

84
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,200
Another bowl.

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,500
You're being impolite.

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,400
- Here you are. 
 - Thank you.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,000
I haven't been back for a long time. I really miss this flavor.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,400
In that case, you should stay here a little longer.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I mean... Hey, I want another bowl, too.

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,700
I learned from Shifang's letter that you are also investigating Qiyuan Sect.

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Alliance Leader Zuo, Qiyuan Sect has committed many evil deeds.

92
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,600
It's our job to get rid of them.

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,500
Brother Yue, I have informed Alliance Leader Zuo about the matter of Bian Luohuan.

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Righteous Martial Alliance and Qiyuan Sect have been fighting for a long time,

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
but we've never had a clue about Shengxuan.

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Young Hero Yue, don't get discouraged.

97
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,700
We've been receiving a lot of anonymous information from heroes in recent days.

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,400
With these clues,

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,200
we wiped out the stronghold of the Jiangning branch of the Qiyuan Sect.

100
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,900
The sect leader of the Qiyuan Sect was inspecting there, so we killed him too.

101
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,400
Besides, I have a crystal

102
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,000
found by Master Luo from the Luori Village stronghold.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,700
Unfortunately, we don't know its origin.

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,600
Do any of you might have a clue?

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,400
 Isn't it the crystal from Wuyan Village? 

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
 How did it end up in Luori Village? 

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,700
 I might trade the information about the crystal for a favor, 

108
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,900
 so I can ask the Righteous Martial Alliance to help us investigate our origins. 

109
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,400
Qi, doesn't this crystal look like the one we saw in Wuyan Village?

110
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,200
Right. I remember when I woke up, I think I saw this crystal.

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Alliance Leader Zuo, we lived in Wuyan Village for a while.

112
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
Since this crystal is related to Wuyan Village,

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,900
if you don't mind, we can go and investigate it.

114
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,200
Brother Luo, do you think so?

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,900
Of course.

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,600
Good, then I shall await the good news.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,100
Since you have come to Jing'an,

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,100
if you need anything, just tell Shifang.

119
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Yes.

120
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Come in. This is my Mechanic Skill Hall.

121
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Shifang, your Mechanic Skill Hall looks so nice.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Shifang, what is this?

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
It's for measuring the wind power.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
What's the use of it?

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,900
Of course, it is of great use.

126
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,400
Measuring the wind power would be useful in war and farming.

127
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Zhaoyan, you are amazing.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, I have a lot of useful stuff in my room.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll show you.

130
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,200
Let's go. Here.

131
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,700
This is my room. Feel free to look around.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,479
I've never seen a room like this.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Don't touch it! This is my defense mechanism.

134
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,800
Don't touch it recklessly. The rest is free to look at.

135
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Young Shifang is really passionate about mechanisms.

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
More than that,

137
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,300
if he could he would even make these wooden mechanisms his livelihood.

138
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,600
The mechanisms come from inner inspiration.

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
One day I will show the world the benefits of them.

140
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,300
Yes, you have to promote them.

141
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,700
Thank you, Jinzhao.

142
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,200
- Senior. 
 - Thank you.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,700
Young Zhaoyan, have some tea.

144
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,500
Thank you, Senior.

145
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,300
You've been in Jing'an for days.

146
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,900
Do you have any good scenes to recommend?

147
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,900
I've been here these days and didn't go sightseeing.

148
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,600
Senior, you might as well ask Shifang.

149
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes, Senior Xian Qing.

150
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,900
If there's anything you want to know about Jing'an, you can just ask me.

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Everyone, I am a bit tired and want to get some rest.

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
Thank you, Young Shifang.

153
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,240
But now it is hot, I'll take a nap.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Jinzhao, why do Senior Xian Qing and Zhaoyan seem a bit weird?

155
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Can't you see that Senior Xian Qing likes Zhaoyan?

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,300
Brother Luo and Senior Xian Qing are both men.

157
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,200
It's impossible.

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Is that what liking someone looks like?

159
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Of course.

160
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,599
This is how Zhaoyan sees Xian Qing.

161
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
And this is how Senior Xian Qing sees Zhaoyan.

162
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,300
So it's the unrequited love described in the storybooks?

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
W-W-Well, this is terrible.

164
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Nothing terrible.

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,100
Are you hungry? I'll take you for some snacks.

166
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,200
- I'll take you. 
 - You take care of the mechanisms.

167
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
- Let's go. 
 - Go to have snacks.

168
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,900
Right... Then you take Young Yue for some delicious food.

169
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,800
   

170
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,900
- Here, miss. 
 - Thank you.

171
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,000
Owner, I would like water-chestnut cake, osmanthus cake,

172
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
sesame candy, chestnut pastry, and cherry blossom custard.

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Miss, eating too many sweets will harm you.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,500
But I want to eat them all.

175
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
I'll have one of each.

176
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,699
Jinzhao, I also want to drink that plum soup.

177
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,100
Do you think we still have money?

178
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes.

179
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Miss, please wait, I'll get some wrapping paper.

180
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Zhu'er.

181
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,800
Zhu'er! I've finally found you, Zhu'er.

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,200
Who are you?

183
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Let's go. I'll make you something delicious.

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,300
- Who are you? 
 - Take care.

185
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know you.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
- Qi! What's the matter? 
 - Come on, Zhu'er.

187
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,100
She grabbed me.

188
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,600
Sorry, both of you! I'm sorry.

189
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,900
- This is my wife. 
 - Zhu'er.

190
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,200
Because our daughter passed away a while ago,

191
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,700
my wife couldn't withstand the shock and lost her mind.

192
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,900
So upon seeing a girl her age, she mistakes her for Zhu'er.

193
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,100
Zhu'er.

195
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,000
Yaofang, that's not Zhu'er, you have got the wrong person.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
That's Zhu'er.

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Zhu'er! Look at me, Zhu'er.

198
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Don't you recognize your mother anymore?

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Yaofang, no. That's not Zhu'er.

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Zhu'er.

201
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,400
Honey glazed lotus root, steamed buns,

202
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,800
and your favorite tofu pudding.

203
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't worry. I won't leave.

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Good then.

205
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,500
Jixing, bring the bowl to Zhu'er.

206
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,700
What did you call me?

207
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,400
Jixing.

208
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Okay, here. The bowl.

209
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,700
Why are you so careless? You forgot our Zhu'er's favorite bowl.

210
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,100
Wait for me, I'll go get it. I'll go get it now.

211
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,800
Your father is always careless.

212
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,800
Here, it's your mother who cherishes you the most.

213
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Zhu'er likes using this bowl the most.

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Your mother remembers it.

215
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,800
- Zhu'er. 
 - It's getting late. Why don't you go back now?

216
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
If you want to visit us next time, you are always welcome.

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,200
What are you talking about? Where do you want Zhu'er to go?

218
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,200
Yaofang, you forgot it again. Zhu'er has already married.

219
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,700
S-She can't always come back.

220
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,600
Married?

221
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,600
Look at your mouth.

222
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,100
What if I'm not around?

223
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,000
She has married?

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,100
- She has married. 
 - Good.

225
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,500
Right, it's good she's married.

226
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,700
 Candied hawthorns! 

227
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Jinzhao, this pastry doesn't look delicious,

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
but it just tastes really good.

229
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,900
Is it the taste of a mother's cooking?

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
Perhaps.

231
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
Shall we come back again?

232
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,100
Don't do this. Senior, there are so many people here.

233
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,800
Senior, please behave.

234
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,300
Behave, Senior.

235
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,200
Are you asking me to behave?

236
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Guest, I'm sorry, truly sorry.

237
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Well, this dog ran over from the back.

238
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,800
But don't worry. I'll handle this right away.

239
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,600
Go away.

240
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,300
Didn't you say you were tired and needed to rest?

241
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Why are you here, and playing with a dog?

242
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,700
I had enough rest, so I came out for a stroll.

243
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,500
Since we're here, let's have a cup of tea.

244
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,400
Sure. After you, Senior.

245
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,600
Young Zhaoyan, why can't you even tell the difference between a dog and a wolf?

246
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,600
Jinzhao, you say, Jing'an is so beautiful, with so many delicious foods.

247
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Why do people still believe in the Qiyuan Sect?

248
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,400
Maybe they feel empty inside.

249
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Empty?

250
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Yes, just like when you woke up three years ago,

251
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,700
everything seemed to be behind a veil and had nothing to do with me.

252
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,000
But I've never felt that way.

253
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:10,399
Because back then you were a fool.

254
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
You're the fool.

255
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I haven't finished.

256
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,400
But it's a good thing I have a fool like you around.

257
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm just starting to feel good about having you around.

258
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
Because I don't have time to overthink

259
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,000
while taking care of you every day.

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Otherwise, I'd have to believe in something to fill the emptiness.

261
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,300
All right, I'll give you this for complimenting me.

262
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,900
Aren't you hungry?

263
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,200
I specifically saved the sweetest piece for you.

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,100
I can't believe you gave me something delicious.

265
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
What?

266
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
There was something stuck on your lip.

267
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,200
Don't you always wipe it off for me?

268
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
Is that Brother Luo and Xian Qing?

269
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,619
It seems to be.

270
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,240
Young Zhaoyan, you don't have to feel like you owe me.

271
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,660
After all, I had your demonic power for over twenty years.

272
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,480
I even got you seriously hurt.

273
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
I was willing to do it for you.

274
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,579
And I promised you I wouldn't put my life at risk again.

275
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:06,479
I have listened to what you said.

276
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,720
Jinzhao, I don't think it's appropriate to watch them.

277
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,160
Nonsense. We are just caring for our friends. You don't know what you're saying. Look.

278
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:43,239
I have things to attend to. I will take my leave.

279
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,280
Senior.

280
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,439
Young Zhaoyan, are you avoiding me?

281
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,059
I thought we'd made ourselves clear.

282
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,379
No, I'm not avoiding you.

283
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,619
Then why were you in such a hurry to leave from the Mechanic Skill Hall?

284
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,320
Or do you not consider me as a friend?

285
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,439
No way. You are my friend, of course.

286
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,859
Making friends with a demon.

287
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:20,060
Aren't you afraid of damaging the Luo family's reputation?

288
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:25,240
Senior, there's no need to care about it, as we are friends.

289
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:35,219
I guess I can't invite you to enjoy the sunset.

290
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,328
I'll take my leave.

291
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,020
They're leaving. Let's follow them.

292
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,459
You follow Xian Qing, and I will follow Zhaoyan.

293
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,459
Okay, just don't get lost on your own.

294
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:06,319
It doesn't matter, as you'll always find me.

295
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,139
Let's go.

296
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:13,780
 Hairpins! Brand new hairpins! 

297
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,176
Senior Xian Qing.

298
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,520
Young Jinzhao, why aren't you with Young Yue?

299
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,020
Aren't you afraid Young Yue will get lost?

300
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,079
Qi and I have Mindlink.

301
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,099
I can always find her no matter where she goes.

302
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:38,959
However, if you don't invite her to enjoy the sunset in advance,

303
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:42,940
she would never know.

304
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,660
You were eavesdropping on my conversation with Young Zhaoyan?

305
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,280
No. I was just passing by.

306
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,260
Zhaoyan, what a coincidence.

307
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,379
Right, Miss Yue.

308
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,140
Why are you here?

309
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,540
I felt it was too stuffy in the Righteous Martial Alliance,

310
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,679
so I came here.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,780
Miss Yue, why aren't you with Brother Yue?

312
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,660
I don't have to be with him all the time. Right?

313
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,920
Miss Yue, have some tea.

314
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,540
S-Sorry.

315
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,040
It's okay, d-d-don't worry.

316
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,959
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. You wait here.

317
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,408
Zhaoyan.

318
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,180
If I'm not mistaken, Brother Luo is actually a lady. Right?

319
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,679
How did you figure it out?

320
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,739
We have traveled together with Brother Luo until now.

321
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:02,400
Except for that time at Fengyan Inn,

322
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,780
Brother Luo insisted staying in a single room even if it cost more,

323
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,499
and never bathed with us.

324
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,880
Also, when playing with the dog, she completely behaved like a lady.

325
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,599
Senior, you have a crush on Brother Luo.

326
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:21,640
You can't hide the affection in your eyes.

327
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,379
You also can't hide your affection for Young Yue.

328
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,699
Senior, are you really to Brother Luo...

329
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:35,520
Young Yue is so curious, so she learns it from you.

330
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,239
Hurry up!

331
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,959
Speak of the devil.

332
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
- What do you want to do? 
 - Jinzhao Senior. Xian Qing. Something has happened.

333
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,300
- What's wrong? 
 - Did something happen to Zhaoyan?

334
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,280
Zhaoyan is a lady.

335
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,959
I thought it was something serious. How did you know that?

336
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,360
Zhaoyan is not quite like you, but seems similar to me.

337
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:12,820
There are some parts you can't touch.

338
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,160
I didn't mean to do it.

339
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,716
Let's go.

340
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:34,180
Why does Zhaoyan pretend to be a man?

341
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,660
How would I know? Ask her yourself.

342
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,199
Does Miss Ming Xiu know it?

343
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,300
What do you think?

344
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,100
So it's only me and Shifang who didn't know.

345
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,360
Jinzhao, I can't believe it. You liar.

346
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:53,639
Minister, I have arranged everything.

347
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,839
I have investigated them.

348
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:05,080
Annoying Jinzhao, why didn't you tell me that Zhaoyan was a lady?

349
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,460
You too, Senior Xian Qing.

350
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,820
I just knew it. It's all Senior Xian Qing's fault.

351
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,579
What does it have to do with me?

352
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,300
Wait. Fortunately, Zhaoyan is a lady.

353
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,379
Otherwise, Senior Xian Qing, we would think you are into m...

354
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,739
Making trouble, right?

355
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:24,160
Don't talk nonsense. How can you just say anything?

356
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,660
Let's go.

357
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,460
Hold on.

358
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,379
Senior.

359
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:35,619
Huanxing incense.

360
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,920
Wolf demon! Someone, there is a wolf demon!

361
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
Let's go, we'd better take him away.

362
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,036
Qi, let's go.

363
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,976
Qiyuan Sect.

364
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,640
Huanxing incense. This is bad!

365
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,599
- Right over there! 
 - Hurry up!

366
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,460
 - A wolf demon.  
 - Stop them!

367
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,000
Xian Qing.

368
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:39,099
Alliance Leader Zuo, is this how you treat your guests?

369
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:42,260
The Righteous Martial Alliance never associates with demons.

370
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:46,308
A wolf demon...

371
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,579
is not a guest of the Righteous Martial Alliance.

372
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:52,540
Alliance Leader, they are harboring a demon. Let's take them down.

373
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,300
Attack!

374
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,496
Senior Uncle.

375
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,199
Qi, how are you? Are you okay?

376
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,800
Senior Xian Qing.

377
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,620
Master Luo. Miss Ming.

378
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Do you also want to make enemies of the Righteous Martial Alliance

379
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
and side with the wolf demon?

380
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Master Luo. Miss Ming. Kill this wolf demon.

381
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,400
I know Master Luo is a righteous person.

382
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,479
I will never allow anyone to hurt him.

383
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Alliance Leader, save your words. Brothers, let's take them down!

384
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,600
Qi, find a chance to get away.

385
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Stop! Stop fighting!

386
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Stop! Stop fighting! Jinzhao, stop fighting!

387
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,100
Stop fighting!

388
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,000
Alliance Leader, though Senior Xian Qing is a demon,

389
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,500
he has been helping us track down the Qiyuan Sect all along and saved us from danger.

390
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,100
Alliance Leader, Senior Xian Qing is a good demon.

391
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,000
Shifang, move aside.

392
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,500
Alliance Leader Zuo, since the Righteous Martial Alliance

393
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,830
doesn't associate with demons, we can just leave.

394
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,000
Why do you have to kill him?

395
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,100
Since he's a demon, don't even think about leaving here today.

396
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,200
I won't allow anyone to hurt Senior Xian Qing.

397
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Take them all down.

398
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,800
- Jinzhao. 
 - Qi!

399
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,700
Jinzhao!

400
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,600
Take Senior Xian Qing away.

401
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Go.

402
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,000
No. I can't run anymore.

403
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,600
I can't run anymore.

404
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,500
Young Jinzhao. Young Zhaoyan. Sorry for dragging you down.

405
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,100
Don't talk like that to friends.

406
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll go ahead and buy us some time.

407
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,570
Please protect Xian Qing.

408
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,000
Then I'll go too, so you can take Xian Qing away.

409
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,300
Would you like to be friends with a demon?

410
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,100
You still have the strength to say such things now.

411
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,200
Shifang told us who you were long ago.

412
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,780
So you've been my friend all along. Let's go.

413
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,300
Put me down. Just go find Young Yue.

414
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,760
Go ahead, Brother Yue. I'm here.

415
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,000
Come on.

416
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,600
Here you are. Just go.

417
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Then you guys should be careful.

418
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,400
Young Zhaoyan, sorry for making you worry.

419
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,500
Don't say so, Senior.

420
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,500
 I don't know who released the Huanxing Incense, but you would have been hurt if I arrived any later. 

421
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,040
Master, I won't allow anyone to hurt Senior Xian Qing.

422
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,310
Bian Luohuan.

423
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,770
What are you doing?

424
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:57,130


425
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,500
