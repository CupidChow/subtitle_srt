2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,116
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,864
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,920
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,432
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,852
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,120
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,324
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:38,376
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,280
   

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,980
   

20
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:07,842
Ju Shifang, you shouldn't be here.

21
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,583
We're enemies, not friends.

22
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,312
I won't show mercy on the battlefield.

23
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:16,933
I want to... I want to see Miss Shuo Xuan.

24
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,763
You think you can just ask to see our lord?!

25
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:21,742
Who do you think you are?

26
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,442
Take him away!

27
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,346
Let him go!

28
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,223
Shuo Xuan.

29
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:38,902
Why bother catching a loser?

30
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,663
Why are you here?

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,149
I...

32
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,082
I came here...

33
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:55,943
Miss Shuo Xuan, I'm here to challenge you.

34
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,127
You?

35
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,795
I know. You think I'm a loser.

36
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,118
But I have to stop you!

37
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,962
You have the key to Rehai. Right?

38
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,642
Can you stop eyeing Rehai?

39
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:11,562
Ying Xuwei says that he has enough Qiyuan Orbs.

40
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:14,423
Fool! You think you can stop us?

41
00:03:14,423 --> 00:03:15,653
Don't try to be a hero.

42
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,553
I'm not trying to.

43
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:22,473
I'm just doing what I want and protecting the people I care about.

44
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:27,968
You said that the people of the Yu Clan value absolute power. Whoever's strongest gets the say.

45
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,983
I'd like to challenge you now.

46
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:33,642
If I win, you have to listen to me and not open up Rehai.

47
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:35,203
Otherwise...

48
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,433
Otherwise...

49
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,956
Otherwise, you're not a hero!

50
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,942
Madman.

51
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,823
You can kill him.

52
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,027
But don't make fun of his resolution.

53
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,342
Say no more.

54
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:52,842
Let him go.

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,043
You still have time to take it back.

56
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:31,643
I won't take it back.

57
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:33,543
I will win.

58
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,883
Dou Bao!

59
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:30,563
Dou Bao. Dou Bao.

60
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,571
Dou Bao. Dou Bao.

61
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,243
Dou Bao.

62
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:46,003
Dou Bao.

63
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:51,142
Dou Bao.

64
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,702
You lost!

65
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:17,623
You still won't give up?

66
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:21,242
I once said that...

67
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:25,882
if we had to fight each other one day,

68
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:28,782
I'd lead you to the right path!

69
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:33,562
But I've also said that I'm already walking the right path!

70
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:35,443
Miss Shuo Xuan,

71
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,183
do you remember?

72
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,563
When we first met,

73
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:45,643
you said that if I got within ten steps of you,

74
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:48,222
you would tear me apart.

75
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:53,603
 If you come within ten steps of me, I'll tear you apart. 

76
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:59,743
I remember.

77
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:59,943
I may not have a chance to say it out loud if I don't do it now.

78
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:05,603
I'm timid, weak, and selfish.

79
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:16,743
But I've always, always, been following your steps,

80
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:26,663
and have always dreamed of being a hero, a respected man.

81
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,602
It's...

82
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:05,562
It's just... we hold different sets of values.

83
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:07,182
So...

84
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:11,842
So we're bound to be enemies.

85
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,722
Ju Shifang, enough!

86
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:37,822
No matter how it ends, I admire your courage!

87
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,503
Go back!

88
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,003
Surrender.

89
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:51,883
This isn't a fight. It's suicide.

90
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:21,083
Ju Shifang, stop there!

91
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Miss Shuo Xuan,

92
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,900
I like you.

93
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,200
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

94
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,200
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

95
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,300
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

96
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,600
♫  Following your silhouette across thousands of miles  ♫

97
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:51,000
♫  Like a bird chasing clouds to the horizon  ♫

98
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,300
♫  My heart can't help but draw closer to you  ♫

100
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Shuo Xuan.

101
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

102
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,500
♫  If love arises with the wind, how do I calm it?  ♫

103
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,000
♫  I've done my best, but our paths just won't cross  ♫

104
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,800
♫  I've done my best, but our paths just won't cross  ♫

105
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,200
♫  Look at the sky, the leaves fall like rain  ♫

106
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,200
♫  It's me, scattering all my love  ♫

107
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,400
♫  The distance that can't be crossed is fate  ♫

108
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Shifang!

109
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,500
Shifang. Shifang.

110
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
Shifang!

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Weird. Where is he?

112
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,600
 Jinzhao. Little Yue. Zhaoyan. 

113
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,000
 Xian Qing. Miss Ming. 

114
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,400
 It feels kind of awkward to write down all your names like this. 

115
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,300
 I had been hiding in my own little world before I met you all. 

116
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,200
 Many things have happened while I was with you. 

117
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
 Some weren't that pleasant, 

118
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 but it felt like I woke up from a dream... 

119
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,300
 and finally saw the world for real. 

120
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
 It can be bad. 

121
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,000
 It can be nice. 

122
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,700
 Now, I finally have the courage to do something... 

123
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,800
 to make up for my mistakes and protect the people I care about. 

124
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,300
 I'm glad I can help everyone. 

125
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,100
 Although I'm still a bit scared. 

126
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,500
 - I'm sorry. I dare not say goodbye to you.  
 - Shifang.

127
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Shifang!

128
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,300
 - I dare not see A'Yang...  
 - Shifang...

129
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,600
 and our leader. 

130
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,800
 Please apologize for me. 

131
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,200
 I'm so lucky to have met you. 

132
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
 Thank you all. 

133
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
 Goodbye. 

134
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,500
Shifang.

135
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,800
Shifang.

136
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
 Brother Yue, do I look like a hero like this? 

137
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,760
 Jinzhao, I've been dreaming of the day you would use my invention. 

138
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,000
 I didn't dare face any of this. 

139
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,400
 I'm useless and selfish and almost got Senior Gu killed. 

140
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
 Sorry, Jinzhao. 

141
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,400
 But I want to do better. 

142
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,600
♫  One branch, two lifetimes of flowers  ♫

143
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,300
♫  After autumn comes spring, in the end everything falls  ♫

144
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,500
 Then it's a deal. 

145
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
 You'll celebrate... 

146
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,000
 my birthday every year. 

147
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,100
 This day every year. 

148
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,400
♫  Under the Chinese parasol tree  ♫

149
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,800
 I won't change at all. 

150
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,800
♫  The branches break in exchange for memories  ♫

151
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,400
♫  Like silk threads, weaving into mist in the painting  ♫

152
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,200
♫  And into rainbows that worry and care  ♫

153
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,500
♫  Wishing you a lifetime of annoyance and foolishness  ♫

154
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,700
♫  Exchanging your entire past to bury it in the chaos  ♫

155
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:27,300
♫  Accompanying you through the ups and downs, following you blindly, enduring it silently  ♫

156
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,000
♫  Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  ♫

157
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,200
♫  Writing down each trace, each detail, each word, each line about your struggles  ♫

158
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,400
♫  For you, I'm irrational and foolish  ♫

159
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,000
♫  Betting your entire life, your thoughts, your heart, your hope, that one moment  ♫

160
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,200
♫  Without an answer, without giving up  ♫

161
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,100
Shuo Xuan, are you all right?

162
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,700
It won't disrupt Her Lordship's plan.

163
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,900
Rest well.

164
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
Oh, right.

165
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,800
Have you performed the Meditation Spell on Her Lordship again?

166
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,100
It didn't work again.

167
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
You're still too restless.

168
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,600
Cultivate yourself while you're resting.

169
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Lin Yuan.

170
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,300
How did he manage to do that?

171
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,500
Wasn't he a coward?

172
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Do you still...

173
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,900
think of him as a coward?

174
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,400
 Miss Shuo Xuan, th-this is for you. 

175
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
 I'm not interested in these things. 

176
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,300
 I got a nice name for this Luban lock. 

177
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,900
 "Respected old friend". 

178
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,200
You always brush me off with some useless gadget.

179
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
 I-I just... 

180
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,100
 You like me? 

181
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,700
 W-Well, I saw you... 

182
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,100
 We admire heroes and warriors. 

183
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,000
 You? You're a coward who can't even defeat me. 

184
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,200
 I've become... much better than before. 

185
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,600
 If being a great hero needs to sacrifice many lives, 

186
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,400
 I'll give up being a hero then. 

187
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:37,200
 I've always dreamed of being a hero or a respected man. 

188
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,100
 It's just that we hold different sets of values. 

189
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,700
 We're bound to be enemies. 

190
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,600
 Miss Shuo Xuan, 

191
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
 I... 

192
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,200
 I just want to say... 

193
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,800
 I'm sorry. 

194
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Respected old friend.

195
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,200
You fool.

196
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,300
Respected old friend.

197
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,000
 Commander Ge, is that true? 

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
 My mother really was a member of the Hengdao Sect? 

199
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,100
 That's right. 

200
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 She left the design of Dou Bao at Yujie Hub. 

201
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,000
 The Hengdao Sect was founded to pass on the techniques. 

202
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,400
 It gathered those who love machines. 

203
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,400
 But the world is in grave danger, 

204
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,800
 so we're using everything to go against Zhu Yu. 

205
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,300
 Then... my mother was a master of machines. Right? 

206
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,600
 Of course. She was really talented. 

207
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,300
 She even personally designed this arm for me. 

208
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
 Then... 

209
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,800
 Then, why did she leave the Hengdao Sect? 

210
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,700
 Because she fell in love with someone. 

211
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
 Twenty years ago, 

212
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,900
 your mother left the Yujie Hub to seek further development of machines. 

213
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,400
 One day, she sent a letter to Yujie Hub, 

214
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,700
 saying that she met someone and no longer wanted to wander the world. 

215
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,000
 I was young when my mom passed away. 

216
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,600
 There are many things I don't remember anymore. 

217
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,600
 Dou Bao is all I have left. 

218
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,400
 Your mother... always said one thing. 

219
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,200
 Mechanical skills aren't just about making a living, 

220
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
 but about benefiting the people. 

221
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,800
 I'd like to pass on this teaching to you. 

222
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,100
 I have to talk to Third Brother. 

223
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,300
 I'll be going now. 

224
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,000
 Thank you, Commander Ge. 

225
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,050
   

226
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
 Mother. 

227
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,100
 I'll definitely make an even more amazing machine. 

228
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
Shuo Xuan has the key of Rehai.

229
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,300
I'll make sure she recovers completely before Rehai reaches the Buried Wind Plains.

230
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,000
Thank you, Your Lordship.

231
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,000
Your Lordship,

232
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
the Hengdao Sect and the Righteous Martial Alliance have always been watching us.

233
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,200
We'll be under attack once we open up Rehai.

234
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,800
It's all right.

235
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,400
The Hengdao Sect is completely focused on the Buried Wind Plains.

236
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,500
Your Lordship,

237
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,900
why don't we launch an attack on Yujie Hub to take their Qiyuan Orbs?

238
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,400
The dark feelings of humans will corrupt my mind if I keep consuming Qiyuan Orbs.

239
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Say no more.

240
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Make sure everything goes perfectly with Rehai.

241
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,700
Understood.

242
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Qiyuan Orbs.

243
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,000
If I want to satisfy my hunger,

244
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,200
the Qiyuan Orbs aren't enough.

245
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,800
 It's about the life and death of our clan. 

246
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 I just hope My Lord, that you're still that benevolent mythical beast. 

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Young Xiu.

248
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Do you have something on your mind?

249
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Senior Uncle.

250
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Before Young Master Ju passed away...

251
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,100
I received a letter.

252
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,100
   

253
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,600
I've seen this handwriting in the Luo secret chamber.

254
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,100
It's Luo Maiming.

255
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,700
It is him.

256
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Only Young Shifang and you got this letter?

257
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Young Xiu, I haven't seen you like this for years.

258
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm guessing...

259
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,000
you're thinking that if you had done something then,

260
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Young Shifang might have not died.

261
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Right?

262
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,700
Don't get confused.

263
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,000
What has already happened can't be changed.

264
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,800
It's like a fantasy or an illusion.

265
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Obsessing about it will only stop you from progressing.

266
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,700
I won't.

267
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,400
You're a tough girl.

268
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
You'll keep progressing.

269
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,800
If it was Luo Maiming's plan,

270
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,100
I should've been the one sent to die.

271
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,200
Why didn't I get a letter?

272
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Senior Uncle, I don't think Luo Maiming had the heart to kill you.

273
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,400
Why not?

274
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,000
Why wouldn't he?

275
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,300
 I understand now. I understand. 

276
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,800
 Luo Maiming, you really are shrewd. 

277
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,700
 He entrusted Zhaoyan to me. 

278
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,000
 She's the one he cared about the most. 

279
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
Senior Uncle.

280
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't worry about me.

281
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,900
It's late. Get to bed.

282
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,000
Let's head back to Yujie Hub tomorrow morning.

283
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,700
The Righteous Martial Alliance is heading to Buried Wind Plains.

284
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,800
Just like Shifang, they're risking themselves to earn us a chance to kill Zhu Yu.

285
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,600
There will be casualties in the battle against the Kun.

286
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,700
But before it has even started,

287
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Shifang has...

288
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,800
The deceased is gone. The survivors should live on.

289
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,000
Young Shifang left us a lot more than a painful memory.

290
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,200
Speaking of which, when I first met him,

291
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,200
he was peeking at Shuo Xuan while she was bathing and got kicked into the water.

292
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,900
He's the one who showed me what a friend was.

293
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
Yes.

294
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
Strange.

295
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Since when did I stop finding him weak and timid?

296
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,400
I'm not even surprised...

297
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
that he ended up like this.

298
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
Yes.

299
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,600
We... aren't who we used to be anymore.

300
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,400
I have to save the world from Zhu Yu.

301
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,500
Jinzhao,

302
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,500
I'm not afraid.

303
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,200
None of us are.

304
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,900
 Among you, two will die soon. 

305
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,800
 Wh-What do you mean? Don't try to scare us. 

306
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,200
This is the main control.

307
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,000
Did you send Shifang to die?

308
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,200
We needed to send Yue Qi's blood to Mist Soul.

309
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,400
We had to get access to Zhu Yu through Shuo Xuan.

310
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,500
So Shifang had to be sacrificed?

311
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,900
If we can't stop Zhu Yu, everybody will die.

312
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,000
It's just a matter of time.

313
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,600
This is the light turret we'll use to attack the Kun.

314
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,800
I'll personally operate it here tomorrow.

315
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,500
For the Mortal Realm, I'll try my best to stop Zhu Yu.

316
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,000
The Righteous Martial Alliance will reach Buried Wind Plains tomorrow.

317
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,300
 Zhu Yu, 

318
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
 the final battle will be tomorrow. 

319
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
   

320
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,800
Drinking alone makes you sulky.

321
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,900
Drinking together is a pleasure.

322
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I never drink alone.

323
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,500
I don't believe you.

324
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
Whatever.

325
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,900
You tossed the coin after so much hesitation.

326
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,100
You don't want to see the outcome?

327
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,200
No need.

328
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
Thanks for the wine.

329
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Brother Hanjiang,

330
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,300
it occurs to me that Young Jinzhao has some of your temperament.

331
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,600
Young Master Yue. What's wrong?

332
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,800
Miss Ming, if anything happens to me, please take care of Qi.

333
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,400
Why? You two always fight together.

334
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,000
She won't be safe if anything happens to you.

335
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
Not necessarily true.

336
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,100
Qi has grown up.

337
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,500
Even if I'm not there, she will have you all and do just fine.

338
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,600
Jinzhao, you don't believe in fate.

339
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,200
But what is fate?

340
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,400
Even if I knew the result, I'd do my best to fight it.

341
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,000
So either way, I can bear the consequences tomorrow.

342
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,600
I didn't expect you to be so insightful.

343
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,300
Anything is possible.

344
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,000
What if?

345
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,800
If anything goes wrong, I'll entrust Qi, that mythical beast, to you.

346
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm off.

347
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,900
 The machines of Yujie Hub can attack the physical form of the Kun. 

348
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,600
 But it's a mythical beast. 

349
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,300
 The attack has to land on the weakest spot to work. 

350
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:35,200
 Commander Ying had observed Zhu Yu for years and came up with three possible spots that might work. 

351
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,200
 The stored energy only gives Yujie Hub a chance to launch three attacks. 

352
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
I didn't say yes.

353
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:53,462
I also have someone to protect.

354
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,500
I can do it, too.

355
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,000
So? Did you find her?

356
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,100
We can't find Sister Ming Xiu anywhere.

357
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,800
Where could she go?

358
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Ming Xiu is a careful person.

359
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Was she compelled to leave?

360
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,200
Ever since Brother Hanjiang passed away, nobody could contain her.

361
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,900
I was negligent.

362
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,500
We must not delay. I'll go open up Rehai. You try to enter Mist Soul.

363
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,000
Let's split up.

364
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
No, we can't.

365
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
That's right, Zhaoyan. We have to stick together.

366
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,300
Yes, we can't split up.

367
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,400
Okay. Let's face the adversity together.

368
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,200
Rehai has moved to the Buried Wind Plains.

369
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Zhu Yu will naturally take Shuo Xuan there.

370
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,700
According to our plan,

371
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,900
when Shuo Xuan uses the fake key ring to open up Rehai,

372
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,700
Luo Zhaoyan will open up Rehai, too.

373
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,800
At that moment, Zhu Yu will unexpectedly absorb the power of Rehai.

374
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,700
The unbinding spell will be activated and Zhu Yu will lose Vitality Energy fast.

375
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,600
I hope everything goes well.

376
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
   

377
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,800
If you don't come to your senses,

378
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
the Righteous Martial Alliance will fight you to the end!

379
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,600
Leader Zuo, you're a heroic man.

380
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,700
If we weren't enemies, I'd make friends with you!

381
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,800
We're enemies. Save it!

382
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,000
All right!

383
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,400
Charge!

384
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:51,000


385
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,800
♫  Twinkling stars, dotting the surface of the lake  ♫

386
