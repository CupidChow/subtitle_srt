1
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:25,070


2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,756
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:39,864
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:44,732
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:49,980
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,424
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,832
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,872
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,952
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,428
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:11,496
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:15,484
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:21,792
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,320
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,528
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:38,628
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,608
   

19
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:59,940
   

20
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,999
You must have saddened Her Lordship again.

21
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,260
Come with me and apologize to her.

22
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,990
Shuo Xuan,

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,020
ever since I met you in the Jincui Oasis,

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,419
you've been treating me badly.

25
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,819
Do I owe you money or have I done something to you?

26
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,859
You took away my mother.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,499
You are Zhu Yu's daughter, too?

28
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,860
My mother was Ling Ye, the previous queen of our clan.

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,760
The body that Zhu Yu is using now...

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,200
is my mother's.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,880
Hundreds of years ago, the Yu Clan resided at the bottom of the North Sea.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,560
Our Queen Ling Ye, my mother,

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,140
found a nice and warm habitat in the North Sea

34
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,060
and migrated the entire clan there.

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,040
Hundreds of years later, the Sea of Clear Skies prospered

36
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
and became the Pearl of the North Sea.

37
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,059
And then? How did Ling Ye pass away?

38
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,499
How did Zhu Yu become the Lord of the Yu Clan?

39
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:21,840
Nobody knew the Sea of Clear Skies was built on the back of Kun.

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,080
Kun was born from the sea.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,179
It sleeps for hundreds of centuries to gather strength,

42
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:34,340
waiting to jump out of the sea and ascend.

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,952
You're right.

44
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,999
On the day of its ascension,

45
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:56,179
the Sea of Clear Skies on its back almost collapsed into ruins.

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,140
My mother Ling Ye drained her power

47
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,360
to reach Kun's awareness via the Meditation Spell,

48
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,759
and stopped the ascension.

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,280
So Kun was Zhu Yu?

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,260
Her Lordship stopped ascending.

51
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,599
She took over Ling Ye's body and started saving the Yu Clan.

52
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,780
She housed all the survivors here

53
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,160
and treated them with her life power.

54
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,899
Years later, those who were less injured or had greater energy

55
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,360
could finally move around.

56
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,140
All the survivors of the Yu Clan you see

57
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,360
have been cured by Her Lordship with her life power.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,379
She was drained and about to die.

59
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,639
But thanks to Qiyuan...

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,179
Since you're back with Her Lordship now

61
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,739
and have become the young lord,

62
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:13,999
you should appreciate her sacrifice for the clan.

63
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,499
She ended up like this...

64
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,336
because of us.

65
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,579
Zhu Yu. Zhu Yu.

66
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,019
I thought you had left.

67
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,120
Zhu Yu, Shuo Xuan told me what happened back then.

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,960
I didn't know you had suffered.

69
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:52,179
So will you stay at the Sea of Clear Skies?

70
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,739
I'm willing to offer you anything as long as you stay.

71
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,840
You're still mad that I lied to you?

72
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,520
No, it doesn't matter anymore.

73
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,379
Zhu Yu, Shuo Xuan would make a better young lord than me.

74
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,859
There's nothing I can do here right now.

75
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,800
I don't understand the responsibilities she mentioned.

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,680
I want to go out there and gain experience myself.

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,319
Only then can I be helpful to you one day.

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,479
My daughter has grown up.

79
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:59,039
I often recall the days when I was carrying you.

80
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,400
I was amazed.

81
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,280
You were such a tiny creature.

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,039
Yet your heart pounded louder than anything in the world.

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,440
As I said...

84
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,000
if you wanted to stay or wanted to leave...

85
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,160
it was your freedom to choose.

86
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:30,919
The Sea of Clear Skies moves.

87
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,200
Take it with you and you'll sense my location.

88
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,719
The next time I come back,

89
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,819
I'll bring you my favorite Ji Family pastries.

90
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,696
Go.

91
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,324
Senior Gu.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,199
You're finally here.

93
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:36,580
It looks like someone has told you I'd come by today.

94
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,379
Miss Ming wouldn't eat or come out.

95
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,120
Is she fine in there?

96
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,120
There is a reason. Xiao Xiu hates meeting people on her birthday.

97
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,800
I apologize on her behalf.

98
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,840
Please don't say that.

99
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,219
Young Brother Ju, do you own this property?

100
00:08:57,219 --> 00:09:01,579
Well... I guess.

101
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,760
Senior, what...

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,680
He exerted his prowess without any warnings.

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,700
Does this count as "like master, like disciple?"

104
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,860
Master.

105
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,360
 I rarely come to Jing'an. 

106
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,279
 I heard that the river view in the city is amazing, especially at night. 

107
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
 Xiu'er, come with me for a walk. 

108
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,044
Join us at the port for fine wine.

109
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,599
I'll go and get Jinzhao.

110
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,900
Here. Come on.

111
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,200
Welcome. Pick whatever you like.

112
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,300
Look! The lanterns are also a local specialty.

113
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,600
Look around. Pick anything you like.

114
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,199
This one? Here.

115
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a pretty lantern. Thank you, Shifang.

116
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Don't mention it.

117
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,700
And for Senior Gu. Here.

118
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,100
Get him the same one as yours, Miss Ming. What do you say?

119
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,600
Thank you. Such a delicate lantern brings out the deepest nostalgia.

120
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,400
Jinzhao, check this out.

121
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
- If Young Yue were here, she'd love it. 
 - See you at the port.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,200
Look. So lively.

123
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,700
Yes.

124
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,100
Over there.

125
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,500
Xiu'er is here.

126
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Please take us to the shore.

127
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,100
All right.

128
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,432
How many are there left?

129
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,000
- Five. 
 - Qi.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,900
You are...?

131
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,400
Young Zhaoyan, why is your lantern different from Xiao Xiu's?

133
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,500
It was a random pick.

134
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
You picked a wolf?

135
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,900
A wolf? It's obviously a dog.

136
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,000
The meat smells great.

137
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
It looks like a wolf to me.

138
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,400
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

139
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,400
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

140
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,600
♫  Sincerely, I begin to write, our hearts connected  ♫

Jinzhao, our feelings are not fake.

159
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,700
There's no such thing as the Companion Life Spell.

160
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,100
I know.

161

♫  Never doubt, the steadfastness of my heart  ♫

162
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,200
Sister Ming Xiu, happy birthday!

163
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Thank you. Welcome back.

164
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Everyone's here. Xiao Xiu will have a perfect birthday.

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Yes. Time is pressing.

166
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,100
I made a gadget for Miss Ming.

167
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,400
It transfers small items. Here.

168
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,000
Miss Ming, do you like it?

169
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,664
Thank you, Shifang.

170
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Miss Ming, I saw this at the accessory shop.

171
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,300
I hope you like it.

172
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,832
Thank you, Zhaoyan.

173
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
How do you know it wasn't Brother Hanjiang?

174
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,100
It was me, though.

175
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,200
Only you would make a fuss about it.

176
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,200
It's not an important day.

177
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I find it important.

178
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,280
Sister Ming Xiu, birthday matters.

179
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,600
- But I didn't... 
 - Didn't what?

180
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,800
Didn't what?

181
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,000
- Here. It's from both of us. 
 - Thank you.

182
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When did you get it? How did you know I'd be back?

183
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
I just did.

184
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,400
Miss Ming, I heard in the Western Regions,

185
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
if someone makes a birthday wish,

186
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
Heaven will make it come true.

187
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,059
Really? Miss Ming, come on. Make a wish.

188
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,619
My master knows my wishes.

189
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,400
I've aged.

190
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,000
I only hope that someone can fulfill your wish soon.

191
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,440
Some wishes can't be fulfilled by random people.

192
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,719
Young Yue, what do you wish for?

193
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:32,100
Endless delicacies, I guess.

194
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,200
I wish I could live happily and peacefully with Jinzhao forever.

195
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
So I matter more than food.

196
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Of course. You'll get me delicacies when we're together, anyway.

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's killing two birds with one stone.

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Thank you.

199
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,100
We know what Jinzhao wants.

200
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,600
What about you, Brother Luo?

201
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
It's still the same.

202
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,700
I want the people to remember the Luo family and me.

203
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,100
Master Luo is truly ambitious.

204
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,000
Xian Qing, what do you wish for?

205
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,600
I have no obsession, hence, no wishes.

206
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,500
Xian Qing, don't be so resolute.

207
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Brother Hanjiang, let go of your obsession.

208
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
What about you, Shifang?

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,500
M-My wish is to...

210
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,200
become a great gadget mechanist like my mother...

211
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,800
and to gather for birthdays like we're doing right now.

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,300
We will.

213
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,800
I didn't know we could make two wishes. I missed out.

214
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Come on, cheers.

215
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,900
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

216
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,800
Ming Xiu, happy birthday!

217
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,400
- Happy birthday! 
 - Thank you.

218
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Jinzhao, look. River lanterns.

219
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,800
- Come with me. 
 - All right.

220
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,200
Flow far far away, my little lantern.

221
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Qi.

222
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,000
Let's stay together forever. Okay?

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,500
♫  Seeking the determination in your eyes  ♫

224
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,600
Deal. If you renege, you are a dog.

225
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,300
♫  In a blink of an eye, light and shadow both freeze  ♫

226
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,000
♫  Searching for you all over the place  ♫

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
♫  Following the trajectory of your heartbeat  ♫

228
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,090
♫  As the distance closes between us, my breathing rate increases  ♫

229
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Do you remember what I asked you in the mine?

230
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,300
♫  One embrace is enough for an answer  ♫

231
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,970
 Qi, who am I... 

232
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,800
 to you? 

233
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,100
♫  Why do I only want you?   ♫

234
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
What is your answer?

235
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,800
♫  This journey is all worth it as long as you're here  ♫

236
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
Anything, just not an older brother.

237
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,800
♫  I'm confident I only want you  ♫

238
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,700
♫  Your smile melts away the difficulties faced on this arduous path  ♫

239
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,500
♫  This journey is all worth it as long as you're here  ♫

240
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,100
♫  I won't listen to any rumor  ♫

241
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,700
♫  I'm confident I only want you  ♫

242
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,900
Shuo Xuan, I don't eat fish anymore.

243
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,759
Young Brother Ju can't drink at all.

244
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,900
Master, your eyes...

245
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,580
It's fine. Maybe I drank too much.

246
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,200
I just remembered.

247
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,100
You used to imitate Xian Qing and me drinking when you were a kid.

248
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,600
But you fell asleep after a few sips,

249
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
and I had to carry you to your room.

250
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,800
Time flies and you've grown up now.

251
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,099
Master, has it ever...

252
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:00,300
crossed your mind that I was only...

253
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,300
You drank a lot. Take a nap.

254
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,700
Will you run away when I'm asleep?

255
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,500
Run away?

256
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
I'm not leaving.

257
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:05,080
Xiu'er, I am really worried about you.

258
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:14,300
Mother, is it true that I'm not gifted as a mechanist?

259
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,500
I want to be like you...

260
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,200
and make fabulous gadgets like Dou Bao.

261
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,599
Also, I swear I will protect Dou Bao.

262
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,900
That's the only thing you left me.

263
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,400
The view is truly breathtaking.

264
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,700
You're heading to the Righteous Martial Alliance.

265
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,900
I won't go with you.

266
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,504
Take care.

267
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Be very careful when you try to take their headquarters.

268
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,500
All right.

269
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,500
Xian Qing.

270
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,500
Where are you going?

271
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,700
Why? Are you reluctant to leave me?

272
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,300
Next time we meet, we'll enjoy

273
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,100
the river view during the day. What do you say?

274
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,992
I'd love to.

275
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,600
It's a deal.

276
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,000
Deal.

277
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,200
    
 Brother Guanren, the trigrams show

278
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,500
the alliance will be in grave danger.

279
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm worried that it's about your attack on the Qiyuan Sect.

280
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,300
I finally found out where their headquarters is. It's a rare chance.

281
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,800
It will be hard to take them down if we miss this chance.

282
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,000
Brother Hanjiang, you're a great man, wise and brave.

283
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,200
But you are slightly obsessed with fortune-telling.

284
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Fine. But I'll come with you.

285
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
That would be great.

286
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Alliance Leader Zuo. Senior Gu.

287
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,800
Here's the map Meng Cheng provided.

288
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,700
It shows the headquarters of the Qiyuan Sect.

289
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,300
They have a front and a rear gate.

290
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,400
Judging from the terrain, we will break in from the front.

291
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,100
As for the rear gate...

292
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
We got this.

293
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,700
All right, you are highly skilled.

294
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,400
They won't be able to handle our attack on both fronts.

295
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,300
It would be great if we could wipe them out in one go.

296
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,700
Time is pressing. I'll inform everyone.

297
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,400
All right.

298
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,300
 Master. 

299
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,300
Master, why didn't you come back with Xian Qing yesterday?

300
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,400
And what happened to your eyes?

301
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,900
You have so many questions.

302
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,200
Which one should I answer first?

303
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,800
I had a glimpse of the future at Pureness a few days ago.

304
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,200
I took a few glances and hurt my eyes.

305
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,100
Are you joining them on the attack because of what you saw?

306
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,900
Xiu'er, I will go with Alliance Leader Zuo.

307
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,400
You will go with Young Brother Yue.

308
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,300
Be careful.

309
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,000
Aren't you going to protect me?

310
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,491
You've grown up now.

311
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:08,700
You don't need my protection.

312
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,340
Master,

313
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,300
I've never let you down.

314
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
But you don't mind letting me down.

315
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,900
 I saw a huge casualty of the Righteous Martial Alliance at Pureness. 

316
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,000
 But I don't know whether it will happen during this attack. 

317
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,100
 But I don't know whether it will happen during this attack. 

318
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,100
 It's less worrisome to have Xian Qing protect Xiu'er in the dark. 

319
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,900
 Other than that, I have to 

320
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,400
 change what I've seen even if it costs me my life. 

321
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,260
   

322
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:49,311
Over the past two decades, our alliance has annihilated

323
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:55,031
countless evil creatures to guard our nation.

324
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:58,650
    
 Now, the nation is at risk.

325
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,110
People are tormented by the Qiyuan Sect.

326
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,911
We must bring justice to the world.

327
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,411
 - Bring justice to the world. 
 - Bring justice to the world. 

328
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:13,270
 - Bring justice to the world. 
 - Bring justice to the world. 

329
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,891
Young Hero Yue Jinzhao.

330
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,936
    
 Alliance Leader Zuo.

331
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:42,031
This blade is named Silver Shadow,

332
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,730
from the collection of the Sword Sage of Mount Shushan.

333
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,250
It was passed on to the Demon Lord's son.

334
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:55,012
I will give this blade to you today.

335
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,070
All the divine and demonic weapons were known

336
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,770
because of what the weapon owners had done.

337
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,236
♫  The vicissitudes of life  ♫

338
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:12,376
♫  The world is in turmoil, but it doesn't matter  ♫

339
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:18,750
♫  You're fighting against the world alongside me  ♫

340
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,850
Alliance Leader Zuo, thank you for giving me this blade.

341
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,370
Alliance Leader Zuo, thank you for giving me this blade.

342
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,850
I shall carry on its spirit of righteousness

343
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:32,150
and make it known in the martial world as my weapon one day.

344
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:38,730
Good. Men shouldn't seek fame from the weapons they hold.

345
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,691
Our weapons should be known because of us.

346
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,030
Young Hero Yue, try it.

347
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:52,184
♫  Unable to forget your gentle look  ♫

348
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:57,280
♫  Between heaven and earth, I travel the world with my sword in hand  ♫

349
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,156
♫  In the end, gratitude and revenge have all been forgotten  ♫

350
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:11,888
   

351
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:25,368
   

352
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:29,270
Our great Lord Ming.

353
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,850
All mighty Lord Ming.

354
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:38,730
I, Gao Xiao, pledge to you as the sect leader of Qiyuan.

355
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,431
We shall serve you with the greatest loyalty

356
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:49,811
and let your glory shine upon the world.

357
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:52,850
May Lord Ming bless us.

358
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,560
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

359
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,951
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

360
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:05,790
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

361
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,052
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

362
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:15,260
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

363
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,032
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 
 - May Lord Ming bless us. 

364
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,736
The map says this is the rear passage to the headquarters.

365
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:49,212
Jinzhao, we must destroy the Qiyuan Sect ruthlessly.

366
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,250
Jinzhao, how come you're always so calm

367
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,991
like you can see the future?

368
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:00,216
To the left.

369
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,690
Jinzhao, are you all right?

370
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,051
Don't worry. It's always like that.

371
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,911
I can see the future indeed.

372
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:18,231
So pull yourself together.

373
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:21,170
With me here, we won't lose.

374
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,010
Young Hero Yue. Hall Leader Ju. Let's enter.

375
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,091
My master came along this time

376
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:41,471
but I have the feeling that he's hiding something.

377
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:44,550
Don't worry, Miss Ming.

378
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,450
There are so many alliance disciples.

379
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,991
And Senior Gu is a great fighter.

380
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:50,550
Nobody will be in danger.

381
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,408
Let's go.

382
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:21,930
Why so hesitant? Hurry up.

383
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,951
Qianjun, no rush.

384
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:28,151
The ground seems dug on both sides. There might be a trap.

385
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:31,110
Let's discuss it first. Young Hero Yue, what do you say?

386
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,631
Let's discuss it first. Young Hero Yue, what do you say?

387
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:34,456
To the left.

388
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,510
Do as he says. To the left.

389
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,410
Old Xu, can we count on him?

390
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,450
Of course. Remember what he did at the Langyin Pavilion...

391
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,832
Move aside.

392
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:09,010


393
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,936
♫  Looking back upon the past  ♫

394
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:23,928
♫  Searching for that moment from the past  ♫

395
00:37:23,928 --> 00:37:27,932
