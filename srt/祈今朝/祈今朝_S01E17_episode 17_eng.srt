1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:25,000


2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Tearing up all the memories of the past  ♫

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,700
♫  Leaving no regrets behind to haunt us  ♫

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  Exchanging a whole lifetime, just to go back again  ♫

5
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,800
♫  If I decide to let my guard down  ♫

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,900
♫  Will I give my heart to the wrong one?  ♫

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,500
♫  Daring to give, not fearing destruction  ♫

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
♫  Love is unwilling to lay dormant  ♫

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,900
♫  Unafraid of shaking Heaven and Earth  ♫

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
♫  Even though we're on different paths  ♫

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,400
♫  I have no complaints and no regrets  ♫

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,400
♫  Because you are the unsolvable riddle set by fate  ♫

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
♫  So I pray for a miracle  ♫

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,800
♫  The stars turn, even if consumed by time, I only hope to search for you  ♫

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,200
♫  Searching for that miracle called forever  ♫

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,500
♫  Until death, we'll walk all the way together  ♫

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:39,000
♫  Love is the most beautiful meaning in life  ♫

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,500
   

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,900
   

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,600
 Sorry, Zhu Yu. 

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,800
 But I need to enter your sea of awareness. 

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
 There's something I have to find out. 

23
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
 So this is Zhu Yu's sea of awareness? 

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,700
 Zhu Yu! 

25
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,679
 How did you get in here? 

26
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
 Zhu Yu, I learned the Meditation Spell from the texts. 

27
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,500
 I'm sorry for entering without permission. 

28
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
 The Meditation Spell? 

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
 What do you want to do now? 

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,400
 I want to know if there's really a way to undo the Companion Life Spell. 

31
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
 Companion Life Spell? 

32
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 Is it for that ridiculous human? 

33
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,000
 Jinzhao is not ridiculous. Don't say that. 

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,700
 Selfish, hypocritical, greedy, angry. 

35
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,100
 Humans fight and kill for their own interests. 

36
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,500
 Is there anything humans won't do? 

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,500
 Zhu Yu... why would you say such things? 

38
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
 Why can't I? 

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,400
 Humans are the only ones on this earth who redden with shame 

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,800
 and who need to feel shame! 

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,200
 You entered my sea of awareness over a human. 

42
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
 How despicable! 

43
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,000
 You're not Zhu Yu. 

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
 I have to leave. 

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,500
 Don't go! 

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,700
 Since you're here, don't bother leaving. 

47
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,600
 Why not stay and keep me company? 

48
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
 After all, the Companion Life Spell can't be undone. 

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 Why bother staying with humans? 

50
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,100
 What? 

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,600
 The Companion Life Spell doesn't exist at all. 

52
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,500
 There is no Companion Life Spell? 

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
 Let me out! 

54
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,559
Qi...

55
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
 It's Qi. 

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,600
What's wrong, Jinzhao?

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Nothing. You all go ahead.

58
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Are you sure?

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,199
Qi...

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,900
is that you?

61
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
What happened to you?

62
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
Qingfei.

63
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,100
Eldest Brother.

64
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,400
Our spies just told us Qi was accidentally injured by Zhu Yu yesterday.

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Injured?

66
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,800
This time, when you see Zhu Yu,

67
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,600
you must remind her to abide by our agreement,

68
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,900
and make sure Qi leaves the Sea of Clear Skies as soon as possible.

69
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,519
Understood.

70
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:59,492
   

71
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,759
Your Lordship, you've been watching over her all night.

72
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,960
You should rest.

73
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,360
The young lord will surely recover.

74
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,700
 For Yue Jinzhao, you even risked your safety 

75
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,300
 and entered my sea of awareness. 

76
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,000
Your Lordship.

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,300
The Hengdao Sect has sent people.

78
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,000
 Among the Nine Springs, Mist Soul 

79
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,400
 is the gloomiest and most chaotic place in the world. 

80
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
 It has strong time energy, 

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 so it can slow down time, 

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
 make people forget their recent memories and... 

83
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,500
  - Travel back in time. 
 - Travel back in time. 

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
I heard Qi was injured.

85
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,800
Don't worry. She's recuperating in the Core of the Demon Realm.

86
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,300
She'll be fine in a few days.

87
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,100
   

88
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,300
Why would it be so serious?

89
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,900
 The spring's power has made a connection with Qi? 

90
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
 Master. 

91
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
 Master. 

92
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,700
 Master, can you please take me to the Mortal Realm for fun? 

93
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,900
 Please. 

94
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,200
Master.

95
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Shouldn't we be at the Yujie Hub?

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Where are we?

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,700
I got it.

98
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,900
You brought me to the Mortal Realm I wanted to come to.

99
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,100
Qi, who am I?

100
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,500
You're my master. Young Huan.

101
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,000
You are the nicest person in the world to me.

102
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 Did the power of Mist Soul 

103
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,000
 bring back Qi's memory from three years ago? 

104
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,100
You thought I wouldn't recognize you with a mask on?

105
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,900
This mask is so ugly.

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,700
 If this is a gift from heaven, 

107
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,100
 then allow me to indulge for a moment. 

108
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,000
Qi, do you... remember Yue Jinzhao?

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Who's Yue Jinzhao?

110
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,100
 I guessed right. 

111
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,400
Don't think about that.

112
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's go to the Mortal Realm and see if there's anything delicious and fun to do.

113
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
What's the matter?

114
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Others mustn't see us.

115
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,800
I know. We snuck out from the Yujie Hub.

116
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
So we need to be careful.

117
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,900
Your Lordship, we came not just to deliver the Qiyuan Orbs,

118
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,200
but to also remind you.

119
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,300
You still remember the agreement we have, don't you?

120
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
It's Bian Luohuan who didn't keep his mask on tight,

121
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,600
which led to Yue Jinzhao and the others finding this place.

122
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
What right do you have to hold us accountable?

123
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Third Brother had a moment of carelessness because he was trying to save Qi.

124
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Your Lordship, you would understand. Right?

125
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,800
Sixteen years ago, in order to save your clan,

126
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,400
you bound Mist Soul with your own blood.

127
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,200
And my eldest brother, as the guardian of Mist Soul,

128
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
to ensure the Nine Springs would remain stable,

129
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,400
made an agreement with you.

130
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,500
You haven't forgotten all this, have you?

131
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Of course not.

132
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You support the Qiyuan Sect to provide Her Lordship with the Qiyuan Orbs.

133
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,100
And Her Lordship had let you take our young lord away to keep as hostage.

134
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,000
Over the years, Her Lordship has never seen the young lord even once.

135
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,400
Did this still not honor your agreement?

136
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,800
But now, you keep Qi at the Sea of Clear Skies.

137
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
Are you trying to break our agreement?

138
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,600
I'd like to boldly ask, why was Qi injured?

139
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Wasn't it you who hurt her?

140
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
 Take a look. Come on. 

141
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,800
 Just take a look. 

142
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,400
 Just take a look. 

143
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,000
 This one's not bad. 

144
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,700
 Do you like any of them? 

145
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,600
 Do you want it? 

146
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,519
Qi, wait here for a moment.

147
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,740
Take a look.

148
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,159
How much are these two?

149
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,399
You're a stranger here, right?

150
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,000
We never take money for goods here.

151
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,300
It's all about bartering.

152
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,959
Is this okay?

153
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,079
Yes.

154
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,040
Thanks.

155
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
Take care.

156
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Give it a try.

157
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
Here, let me help you put it on.

158
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
Look at that.

159
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,900
It's so pretty.

160
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,300
Look over there.

161
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,900
Want to take a look?

162
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,500
This is a Green Conch. It's quite special.

163
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,200
It can record any sound.

164
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,800
Here, it's all about bartering.

165
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,700
I have nothing to my name,

166
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,100
there is not much I can trade with.

167
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,800
Are these okay?

168
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
No.

169
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,664
Master, you're so poor.

170
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:31,800
Girl, this can be traded.

171
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,100
This cannot be traded.

172
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,500
Wh-Why can't it be traded?

173
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,300
When did I get this?

174
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,220
 The power of Mist Soul is fading. 

175
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,140
 Time is running out. 

176
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,399
Qi, are you happy today?

177
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,440
Yes.

178
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,479
Today is my happiest day.

179
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,560
This is also my happiest day in three years.

180
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,940
Listen.

181
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,259
 I want to eat all the delicacies 

182
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:39,492
 and try all the fun things in the Mortal Realm. 

183
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:44,039
 I want to make many friends, just like in the novels, 

184
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,139
 and go on adventures with them. 

185
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,379
 You will. 

186
00:17:55,048 --> 00:18:00,780
 I also want to listen to storytelling, watch plays, and see flowers in the sky. 

187
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,860
 You will. 

188
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,336
 I also want to... 

189
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,040
 You will. 

190
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,560
 The power of Mist Soul is fading. 

191
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,732
 And you're about to wake up soon. 

192
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:21,420
♫  Only visible through the eyes  ♫

193
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:26,119
Master, don't you have anything to tell me?

194
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,528
♫  I'm destined to brave all the dangers for you  ♫

195
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:42,668
♫  Even if fate cannot be escaped in the end  ♫

196
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:49,340
♫  Staking everything just to feel the resonance of our souls  ♫

197
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,079
Sleep.

198
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,800
When you wake up,

199
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,140
you'll forget all this.

200
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,579
Whether Qi stays or leaves is up to her.

201
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,440
Young Huan, when did you get here?

202
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,780
Your Lordship, I hope you'll still stick to our agreement.

203
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:45,339
I will naturally consider it.

204
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,356
Don't worry.

205
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,280
Qi has fallen asleep.

206
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,180
Your Lordship, as long as you keep your promise,

207
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,000
we will deliver the Qiyuan Orbs on time.

208
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,160
The young lord is fine.

209
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,479
It's just that there were two masks beside her.

210
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:45,280
I will keep this orb and study it carefully.

211
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,180
If I can develop something that counters it,

212
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,760
it would be fortunate for the people.

213
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Leader Zuo, Gao Xiao has already gone to the headquarters,

214
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,520
leaving only Meng Cheng as the scapegoat.

215
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,719
But we're already investigating its exact location.

216
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,479
Good.

217
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:05,959
Once we know more about it, we'll set off.

218
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:11,379
Thank you all for your hard work today.

219
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,579
You two heroes are tenacious and incredible.

220
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:20,280
I wonder if you would like to join our alliance.

221
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,319
Shifang, this time you returned in glory.

222
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,640
You'll still be the head of the Mechanic Skill Hall.

223
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,199
Thank you, Leader.

224
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,799
From now on, I will fulfill my duties as the head.

225
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,420
Miss Ming has already joined our alliance.

226
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,279
Why don't you two join as well?

227
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,420
It would be a great pleasure to join you,

228
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,780
but I'm the Master of the Luo family.

229
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,999
I'm afraid I can't.

230
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:55,400
I hope you can understand.

231
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,420
 Joining them is not a bad idea, 

232
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,119
 but they are in irreconcilable conflict with demons. 

233
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Leader Zuo, I'm used to wandering about.

234
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,679
I might have trouble adjusting.

235
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,359
Please let me think about it.

236
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,180
It's all right.

237
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,599
Our gates are always open to you.

238
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:21,039
Thank you, Leader.

239
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,439
What? Someone's thinking of you?

240
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,599
That would be great.

241
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:20,820
But you, Brother Hanjiang, you can't wait to see tomorrow's sunrise. Right?

242
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,699
At least, it's more pleasing to the eye than you.

243
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:27,760
Who wouldn't want to see it?

244
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,264
I'm going to Pureness.

245
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,140
You're awake.

246
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,979
How are you feeling?

247
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:22,440
Sore.

248
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,340
Like I was in a fight in my dream.

249
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,599
What happened yesterday?

250
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:38,119
I remember I used the Meditation Spell

251
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,280
and entered your sea of awareness.

252
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,480
And then you...

253
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,039
Zhu Yu, there is no such thing as the Companion Life Spell. Right?

254
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:58,540
You know now.

255
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,120
You lied to me.

256
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,679
I have my reasons.

257
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,219
Then, what's going on with the you in your sea of awareness?

258
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,799
Qi, don't ask anymore.

259
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,100
I don't want to lie to you.

260
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,080
Zhu Yu,

261
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,760
you're scaring me.

262
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,219
Get some rest.

263
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:28,576
 Zhaoyan, I hope you're doing well. 

264
00:26:33,004 --> 00:26:35,268
- Mount Yuqing... 
 - Mount Yuqing...

265
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,557
Jinzhao. Shifang.

266
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,356
I heard you calling my name.

267
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,352
What happened?

268
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,760
Well, Zhaoyan, sorry.

269
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,332
We opened the letter.

270
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:50,635
But I assure you I only read the first line.

271
00:27:00,164 --> 00:27:03,716
 Zhaoyan, I hope you're doing well. 

272
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:05,476
 It's been a few days. 

273
00:27:05,476 --> 00:27:08,520
 I wonder how you all have been. 

274
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,944
 Mount Yuqing has stunning cloud views, and it's comfortable. 

275
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:16,040
 I'm looking toward Jing'an, thinking everything there must be fine. 

276
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,024
 Today is Young Xiu's birthday. 

277
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:20,736
 Hanjiang and I are going there. 

278
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:24,048
 We're about to see each other and I'm glad about that. 

279
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:27,396
It's all right.

280
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,828
Senior Xian Qing says it's Miss Ming Xiu's birthday

281
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,556
and that Senior Gu will come.

282
00:27:31,556 --> 00:27:33,116
So it's Miss Ming Xiu's birthday.

283
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:37,068
Birthday? Then we need to prepare birthday gifts.

284
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,581
Excuse me. What is this for?

285
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,392
Today is the death anniversary of our former queen, Ling Ye.

286
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:10,328
A grand sacrificial ceremony is being held up ahead.

287
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,780
 Ling Ye? 

288
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,330
   

289
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:21,360
 Ling Ye? 

290
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:28,240
 Why is Zhu Yu called Ling Ye now? 

291
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,421
You're leaving?

292
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,421
I haven't decided yet,

293
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:36,061
but I must tell Jinzhao that the Companion Life Spell isn't real.

294
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:37,900
You mustn't leave.

295
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,441
That's my business.

296
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:42,141
- What does it have to do with you? 
 - You!

297
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:44,081
You come and go as you please.

298
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,181
What do you take this place for?

299
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:49,321
But all of you are lying to me.

300
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,760
If you leave, what about Her Lordship?

301
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,101
Haven't you seen how much she loves you?

302
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,581
But she shouldn't have lied to me.

303
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:05,221
And her other side.

304
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:08,301
It's dark and terrifying,

305
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,861
it makes me uncomfortable and scared.

306
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:15,301
You saw it?

307
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:19,100
You know about it, too?

308
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:24,001
Her Lordship won't harm us.

309
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,421
You must have saddened Her Lordship again.

310
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:28,800
Come with me and apologize to Her Lordship.

311
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,621
Shuo Xuan, ever since I met you in the Jincui Oasis,

312
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,980
you've been treating me badly.

313
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,780
Do I owe you money or have I done something to you?

314
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,501
You took away my mother.

315
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,521
You're Zhu Yu's daughter, too?

316
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,381
My mother was Ling Ye, the previous queen of our clan.

317
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,361
The body that Zhu Yu is using now...

318
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,861
is my mother's.

319
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:20,010


320
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:47,523
♫  The meteor streaks through the sky  ♫

321
00:32:47,523 --> 00:32:51,619
♫  Burning what once was  ♫

322
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:55,749
♫  Forgetting its name  ♫

323

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:20,415

♫  A story full of unexpected encounters  ♫

334
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:30,572
♫  All carefully arranged by fate  ♫
